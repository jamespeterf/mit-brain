21GEO Edit,https://www.21geometry.com/,"21Geo has invented the Precise Motion Technology that enables bearings to support complex motions. The technology comprises a new type of mechanism, on a par with gears, cams and linkages.","21Geo develops and markets the Precise Motion Technology, a new type of mechanism. The technology creates high-efficiency transmissions and mechanisms components. The mechanisms have best-in-class features for robotics and motion control applications. They are also best-in-class for electric vehicles. The technology has unique capabilities for mechanisms. It offers more design flexibility than other types (eg: gears, cams, and linkages) and can solve problems that were not possible before. 21Geo's Center of Excellence helps customers adapt the technology to their specific needs.","The Precise Motion Technology (PMT) takes as an input, the description of motion for two components to create a Motion Specialized Bearing (MSB). Multiple MSB's can be combined to create mechanisms. The technology takes as inputs the description of motion of two components (X, Y, and Rotation). A mathematical optimizer shapes the raceways to ensure the pins roll freely and the contact points on the pins oppose each other. The opposing contact points are carry-forward features from circular bearings. By opposing, a mispositioned pin does not jam. The sensitivity to manufacturing errors are minimized as well. The three input arrays (X, Y, and Rotation) comprise three independent degrees of freedom. That's more than any other type of mechanism. Linkages offer a discreet degree of freedom for each link. The resulting motion is an approximation where PMT offers exact motion. It's this freedom that makes PMT stand out. The transmissions are smaller, more durable, and quieter than gears. It's these features that will make 21Geo's transmissions the preferred drive for robotics and electric vehicles.",MIT alumni as founder | Thomas Dobroth '83 and '85 is the founder.,"dobroth@alum.mit.edu, dobroth@gmail.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Oct 25, 2018",1-9,Hardware/Software Combos & Devices,Aerospace & Defense,Under $2M,,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/19721,2025-08-22T11:07:09

By creating microscopic patterns, we can control material properties like durability, conductivity, adhesion at unprecedented levels. This method, called supercritical-CO2 assisted atomization, produces tiny droplets that deliver the hybrid nanomaterials to surfaces, allowing for scalable, cost-effective manufacturing of nanostructured components. Unlike traditional methods, our approach focuses on creating and combining microscopic patterns, enabling the same material to achieve diverse properties and multifunctionality for advanced, high-performance applications. This innovation enables the synergistic enhancement of multiple functionalities, paving the way for advanced composites that improve energy systems, aerospace components, and everyday products. Our method has the potential to revolutionize manufacturing, boost the economy, and create innovative solutions that enhance lives.","Currently, manufacturing multifunctional coatings with concurrently maximized properties is challenging as increasing one property often reduces another or vice versa. Existing coating technologies often require harsh conditions of temperature or electrical gradients for application. These conditions severely limit the types of nanomaterials that can be applied as the process will often destroy them or, if the nanomaterial is not charged, will simply not work. Other coating techniques cause the nanoengineered materials to agglomerate, destroying their unique nanostructure and properties. Furthermore, depositing multiple nanomaterials to achieve multiple functionalities at once is challenging as most of nanomaterials are not adaptable with one another. This new coating technology, termed Supercritical CO2 Assisted Atomization (SAA), has been demonstrated with a variety of nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), crystalline nanocellulose (CNC), boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT), silicon (Si), and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) on different substrates such as glass, aluminum and polymer (Kapton) to achieve multifunctional nanostructured surfaces.","Supercritical Assisted Atomization is a spray process that produces thin coatings at few nanometers on a variety of substrates. The technique is based on taking a droplet from an aqueous (water) solution with suspended nanoparticles and then exploding the droplet, by the expansion of supercritical CO2 as it converts to gas. The droplets impact the surface and the nanoparticles self-assemble on the surface. The water solvent then evaporates leaving the nanoparticles from the droplet to then adhere to the substrate in a robust, patterned coating. To achieve multifunctionality, different nanoparticles are embedded in droplets by engineering the hydrophilicity/phobicity. Because nanoengineered materials with their high surface area and electrostatic charge are inherently sticky, these coatings have excellent adhesion to a wide variety of surfaces. The rate of deposition economically favors thin coatings with 10 nm precision. In comparison, thick films, measured in microns or thicker, typically use wet, slurry-based techniques.","MIT faculty as founder | A cofounder of Advanced Micro Sprays is Rudolf Schick, an MIT alumni.","amir.asadi@tamu.edu, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Jan 1, 2024",1-9,Nanotech,Materials,Under $2M,"Supercritical Spray, Nanomaterials, functional coatings, stealth, Batteries, Photovoltaics, energy storage devices, electronics, multifunctional displays.",https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/40323,2025-08-22T11:14:11

The metals and mining industry is entering a new era, where the demand for materials embedded in low-carbon technologies is accelerating, as these technologies typically require more resources than their conventional counterparts. For example, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) tend to be 15 to 20 percent heavier than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Furthermore, the energy transition is shifting the materials demand profile, increasing the importance of materials such as nickel, lithium, copper and rare earth elements at the expense of fossil fuels. Rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for many critical electronic components and renewable energy production. However, their purification is complex and resource-intensive, making recovery challenging. The demand for these minerals will continue to rise as the world electrifies, decarbonizes, and advances in computing capabilities – reports show a demand increase from 220 MT in 2021 to 320 MT by 2026. Allonnia's technology addresses these challenges by providing a sustainable method for extracting REEs from wastewater, thereby reducing the environmental impact associated with traditional mining and processing methods. At the same time, this innovation supports the expansion of US REE production and contributes to meeting supply goals without exploiting virgin resources.","Allonnia is developing a biological solution for the selective recovery of rare earth elements (REEs) and copper from water using specially designed metal-binding proteins attached to a solid support. REEs are challenging to recover due to their low concentrations and the presence of competing metals. Allonnia's innovative approach leverages the natural element-selective processes of metal-binding proteins to capture REEs even in the presence of high levels of interfering metals. By designing these proteins to function within a deployment system, Allonnia has created scalable technology for REE recovery at operational mining and manufacturing sites. The process allows wastewater to flow through the column, retaining REEs, which are then eluted at much higher concentrations with minimal interference from other cations.","MIT alumni as founder | Allonnia spun out of Ginkgo, which was founded entirely by MIT alumni and faculty.","6 Tide Street, Suite 300, Boston, MA, 02210 • info@allonnia.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Oct 20, 2020",25-49,Biotech,Biotechnology,$20-100M,"bio-extract, rare earth elements, critical metals",https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/39799,2025-08-22T11:26:38

At Allthenticate, we want to break the mold of security products by providing users with more security and less burden. Our product, Single Device Authentication (SDA), is designed to enable seamless authentication in both the physical and digital worlds by using our Smartphone App to replace keys and passwords, while unifying the management of these credentials into one easy-to-use interface.","Our Technology, Single Device Authentication (SDA), works by creating a secure enclave on every device (i.e., phones, computers, and door locks) that can mutually authenticate each other. The credentials on the mobile devices leverage secure hardware (i.e., TrustZone and Secure Elements) to ensure that even nation station actors would struggle to compromise them. When the user wants to identify themselves, the request is forwarded to the phone where the user is shown a secure prompt to either approve or disapprove the requested action (e.g., unlock a door or login to a website). This enables each resource to implement different requirements, within the same ecosystem. For example, some doors can be configured to open automatically when an employee is near, while others may require the user to take out their phone and apply their fingerprint. Similarly, computers, websites, and internet services can be configured to require different levels of security, based on location, time, or action. We call these three levels: presence (automatically unlocking), intent (yes/no prompt), and identification (fingerprint or PIN). Because we use the same technology, SDA, in all of our products, we are able to quickly adapt to support new applications and grow with the rapidly changing information technology (IT) landscape.","MIT-licensed technology | 3 of the founders were previously employed at MIT LL, where the developed and patented the technology.

ALPHAGUARDIAN Edit,http://www.alphaguardian.net,"AlphaGuardian Networks protects the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Using its patented secure management appliances connected to its AI cloud, AlphaGuardian provides both device security as well as enhanced AI efficiency management for those devices.","IIoT devices include all power, cooling, heating and related systems within buildings and mission critical facilities, such as data centers, laboratories and factories. The communications used in these systems are universally legacy in nature and have numerous cyber vulnerabilities. In addition, traditional central management systems such as Building Management Systems have a 1-to-many polling topology and must consequently poll devices for their data in slow polling cycles. This polling creates both cybersecurity problems with vulnerable communications and poor management decisions based on low-granularity data. AlphaGuardian solves these problems by securing IIoT systems with locally-based secure management appliances and a cloud-based AI system which discovers otherwise unknown system anomalies.","AlphaGuardian's secure management appliances support up to 5 IIoT devices. These devices have 2 Ethernet ports, one for gathering data within their secure internal network connection to each IIoT devices, and one for encrypted push communications to the AlphaGuardian AI cloud. The secure management appliances serve as Zener Data Diodes which, in normal operation, push information unidirectionally via a secured-link to the AI cloud. In the event that a user who has been authenticated via 2 Factor Authentication wishes to issue a command to a device being protected by a Data Diode, they make an appropriate request within the cloud and then the next connection from the Data Diode to the cloud is reversed in a Zener effect and the information is sent back to the Diode for execution on an IIoT device. Because of their proximity and distribution, the Data Diodes are able to gather 95% or more data than would be otherwise accumulated by a traditional building management system or other facilities monitoring system. This allows a large amount of valuable analytics to be calculated with respect to each device, enabling the normal operating parameters to be learned by the system and allowing early detection of system anomalies. Along with early detection, the system's ability to flag only statistically significant events as alarm events, actually prevents nuisance alarms. Nuisance alarms have become such a problem in the process-control industry that ISA and ANSI combined for the 18.2 Alarm Management Standard in an effort to reduce dangerous and wasteful nuisance alarms in the industry. Only AlphaGuardian's patented system can provide statistical evidence of its ability to reduce nuisance alarms while still providing alarms for any statistically significant event.","MIT alumni as founder | Chet Sandberg, PE, is MIT Mechanical Engineering, 1967","111 Deerwood Road, Suite 200, San Ramon, CA, 94583 • bhunter@alphaguardian.net, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Jul 24, 2014",,Software,,Under $2M,"Network Security, cybersecurity, Secure Analytic Management, Industrial, IoT Systems",https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/29951,2025-08-22T11:42:13

This is ma","The Acoustic Wells team is developing a novel pumping control solution for oil fields. The approach leverages a novel sensor and cutting edge control and AI algorithms to maximize the efficiency of a complete oil field. The solution will be plug&play, affordable and scalable. This is made possible by using sensors we developed and patented at MIT which infer the state of the pump deep underground using signals at the surface of the well. The simplicity of the sensors allows us to effortlessly and affordably instrument a complete oil parcel. We then feed that information to our AI algorithms to automatically control each well to allow every producer to pump more oil with a significantly reduced power consumption and maintenance costs. In addition we can actively detect and minimize methane leaks on the well. By taking a holistic approach and instrumenting a complete field, we are able to provide a unique value to the user and bring savings unheard of before.",Amplified Wells has been used across a huge range of operator and asset types all across the US with consistent and repeatable results.

We achieved this by developing a powerful platform technology that uses state-of-the-art 3D-printing and","Current in vitro tools fail to correctly model human myelination and neurodegeneration. Our Artificial Axons platform delivers critical advantages, which make it a superior platform for drug discovery for neurodegeneration.

(ii) It is currently the only platform capable of high throughput drug screening for pro-myelinating compounds using patient-derived human cells, allowing us to directly address human disease and bypass inaccurate animal models. (iii) Unmatched by any of today available tools, our platform rapidly and reproducibly prints fully customizable in vitro human brain environments at scales required in pharmaceutical industries, with tunable geometry and previously unmatched very low mechanical stiffness of nervous tissue, to recapitulate various disease states of nervous system.","3D printing technologies (3DP) have emerged as a potent and versatile tool to deliver these prospects; 3D-printed models of cardiac, muscle and bone tissues and organs-on-the-chip technology have been successfully used in modeling related diseases in the lab. However, current limitations of 3DP and other biomanufacturing techniques prevent scalable production of such models required in biotech and pharmaceutical industries. Moreover, current 3DP cannot afford fabrication of tissue models that require very low mechanical stiffness (< 100 kPa) and close to one micrometer-scale features, such as nervous tissue. Our technology will deliver scalable tools that credibly mimic nervous tissue that will transform the development of therapies for neurodegenerative disease. Toward this goal, we have been developing Artificial Axons, a platform technology to fabricate synthetic axon mimics with the mechanical properties and geometry matching biological axons. To reach commercial readiness we are advancing our technology in several areas including 1) Scalable and reproducible manufacturing of Artificial Axons. This ultimate challenge of 3D-printing of the micrometer diameter fibers with ultra-soft materials that match characteristics of biological axons, in the multi-well plates compatible with pharmaceutical industry setups, with high throughput (minutes per 96-well plate) and minimal variability from well to well will require the development of novel optical hardware solutions and system automation; 2) Development and optimization of the 3D-printable materials. To fabricate Artificial Axons, we have developed a novel propriety class of biocompatible materials with tunable stiffness. However, some cytotoxic components of these materials require a long washing process that slows the production of axon devices. We plan to develop fully biocompatible 3D-printable materials using FDA-approved components, which will not require laborious washing steps; 3) Expand 3D printing capabilities to create any desired features with tunable geometry and mechanical properties, to provide unmatched technology to create models for any disease.","MIT-licensed technology | MIT faculty as founder | The two main Founders are transitioning out of MIT with previous roles as Research Scientist and Postdoc.

We apply rigorous development, validation and manufacturing practices to create products that deliver exceptional value (easier, faster, better, cheaper) that will be backed by outstanding customer support. Initial focus is to develop innovative strategies for directly measuring the activity of protein kinases, which transfer a phosphate group from ATP to serine, threonine or tyrosine residues within protein or peptide substrates. There are over 500 protein kinases and this group of enzymes is intensely studied since dysregulation of kinase activities lies at the center of many human diseases. Therefore, generation of protein kinase inhibitors and the need to accurately measure kinase activities in basic research, drug development and diagnostic applications is an active area that spans many markets including pharmaceutical, biotechnology, diagnostic and contract research companies, academic and Government institutions. Indeed, >30% of all drug development efforts currently are focused on protein kinases. Over 30 drugs have been approved by the FDA, however, these are predominately ATP-competitive inhibitors, which have several disadvantages that reduce their efficacy. More recently, there has been a surge in the generation of non-ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors, with an increased need for better assay tools to effectively characterize their mechanism of action and drive decisions earlier in the drug development process.",,"MIT faculty as founder | Barbara Imperiali, Ph.D., CTO, Secretary and Treasurer, MIT Professor of Biology","260 Cedar Hill Street, Marlboro, MA, 01752 • eschaefer@21stcenturybio.com, imper@mit.edu, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Oct 9, 2015",1-9,Biotech,Biotechnology,NULL,,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/3915,2025-08-22T12:02:41

Senreve was born when, as rising female professionals, we found ourselves in search of the perfect luxury handbag. The company was seeking something that was beautiful and feminine, but also versatile enough to keep up with our everyday lives. However, Senreve discovered most designer bags didn’t fully consider all of these needs, so we decided to take matters into their own hands. With Senreve, women are now free to go about their day with ease, empowered to better live their busy, modern lifestyles. From phone and wallet to laptop and lipstick -- finally a beautiful bag that knows how to multitask. What Senreve has created is a seamless blend of elegant design, impeccable quality and innovative construction. The bags are sleek, structured and designed to carry your life in style. They're also lightweight, travel-friendly and just as appropriate for a business meeting as they are for happy hour or brunch. Bags are made from 100% genuine Italian leather with a pebbled finish. Each bag is expertly handcrafted to look and feel soft and supple, structured yet lightweight, and durable and water-resistant. We’ve also invested heavily in a top quality micro-suede lining that most other brands deem too expensive to use. For us, a top-quality product begins with exceptional ingredients.

"AZENTIVE, LLC Edit",http://www.azentive.com,"AZENTIVE is a majority woman-owned company that integrates wellness, sustainability and emerging technologies based on biomimicry approaches for healthy profits, people, planet and plants. Through the ALife Engine -- our flagship fusion lighting technology -- AZENTIVE brings the only true sunlight indoors, replicating the exact ratios of photons of the sun’s electromagnetic spectrum (UVB to Far IR). AZENTIVE is currently focused on using this fusion sunlight technology in indoor agronomy.","AZENTIVE is led by Dr. Kat A. Donnelly (MIT PhD) with experience founding three startups, leading large-scale projects (30+ years, budgets to $60M), and bootstrapping Empower Efficiency revenue to $7M over 2 years. Sundarajan Mutialu, co-CEO, has yet more experience leading startups, developing and deploying technological inventions, and running companies. Our team boasts extensive experience with plant science, sustainability/efficiency, wellness, materials engineering, behavioral and social science, engineering systems, R&D, manufacturing, entrepreneurship, and more. We have also developed a robust sales pipeline of customers, slowly building up our production, as well as our sales, marketing, and plant science capabilities. It is AZENTIVE's current mission to deliver the cleanest and most nutrient dense food, while substantially reducing the energy and environmental impacts of indoor agronomy.","The ALife Engine is a fusion lighting technology that creates plasma at a high rate extremely efficiently. Plasma is the fourth state of matter and is also the same matter found on the surface of the sun. The ALife Engine technology creates plasma by exciting ions with a magnetic field and changing the state from solid to liquid to vapor to plasma in a vacuum-sealed quartz crystal bulb. As a result, the system creates sunlight at tremendous density, far exceeding typical LEDs that require huge numbers of light emitting sources to achieve the same amount of light -- but only a fraction of the sun’s electromagnetic spectrum. The bulbs have no electrodes to wear out, enabling an almost endless lifetime. The ALife Engine also creates very little heat compared to any other indoor grow lighting technology, making it the most efficient indoor grow light on the market. The ALife Engine offers significant potential to scale up nutrient-dense food production in volume-efficient areas, allowing for local food production. It is the only light source besides the sun that produces radiant flux to deliver the electromagnetic sun spectrum that is necessary for all life on earth. The quality of the light produced is uniform and spans the electromagnetic spectrum -- from 285 nanometers (nm) to 1650 nm and beyond. Providing true sunlight improves the health, respiration, growth rate, nutrient density, and yield of food crops. In addition, all system inputs required for plant production are reduced, including the time to harvest, as well as electrical load, nutrients, supplemental CO2, volume requirements (one 1100-Watt light covers a minimum of 1000 cubic feet for light hungry crops and substantially more for low light plants), etc. True sunlight also allows for biodynamic growing, even indoors. This enables the use of organic living soil built up through compost beds and teaming with beneficial microbes, fungi, and bacteria additives. This living growing medium along with the ALife Engine supports the plant, and allows it to express its complete range of nutrients that are coded in the plant’s genetics just like outdoors. No other indoor growing system enables growth like mother nature. Growing comparisons of food and other crops grows against LED, Metal Halide, High Pressure Sodium, and Ceramic Metal Halide growing lamps have shown that the ALife Engine offers: 1) Substantial decrease in electricity (W) and power (Amps) requirements; 2) Substantial increase in root mass, plant yield, and nutrient density; 3) Decrease in input requirements; 4) Decrease in vegetative growth time; and 5) Increase in respiration rates to improve the ability to uptake CO2. Induction, diode, and electrode growing lighting sources provide inadequate radiant flux for indoor growing, causing high lighting and cooling loads, lower nutrient densities, limited crops that survive indoors, and short technology and spectra lifetimes. The lighting sources are technologically constrained and require suboptimal tradeoffs in spectral range or uniformity. The ALife Engine has the potential to displace Solid State Lighting (SSL) systems, specifically LEDs, as the state of the art for low-energy, high-productivity growth of nutrient-dense plants. The existing body of research on light quality and photomorphogenesis has shown the importance of the bioavailability of light throughout the electromagnetic spectrum for both plant growth and nutrient development. Though variations in photosynthetic efficiency exist, all frequencies of sunlight are used by the plant for development. In particular, Ultraviolet B and A (UVA/UVB), blue, green, red, infrared (IR), and far IR all play key roles, with a combined impact that is much greater than the sum of the individual parts. The technology is in commercial and production use in North America and Europe, as well as around the world as the preeminent solar simulator for R&D and quality control of production solar cells and arrays. Numerous plant-based installations have been deployed in North America and Europe with a steadily growing customer base. The AZENTIVE team is also in various phases of exploration for the numerous other market applications for sunlight, especially in the health and wellness arenas.","MIT alumni as founder | Kat A Donnelly, Dual SM Course 1 and TPP (2008), ESD PhD (2013)","2359 Camino Vida, Palm Springs, CA, 92264 • kdonnelly@azentive.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Oct 1, 2016",1-9,Foodtech,Agriculture,,,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/3303,2025-08-22T12:10:47

Our algorithms process clinically-relevant time-series obtained from commercially-available wearable devices such as smart watches produced by apple, Garmin, Samsung and other companies to characterize the health state of a patient and predict when and how critical changes of the state may occur. According to the World Health Organization, ischaemic cardiovascular disease is responsible for 16% of the world’s total deaths (8.9 million deaths in 2019). Moreover, it is the disease with the largest increase (~29%) in deaths since 2000. Approximately every 40 seconds, someone in the United States will have a myocardial infarction. On average in 2019, someone died of stroke every 3 minutes 30 seconds. There are numerous factors such as advanced age, obesity, high-blood pressure, smoking etc. known to significantly increase the risk of acute ischaemic events. Given standardized scoring systems, clinicians are capable of indicating a higher probability of such events within a time-window of a few years. Yet current medical approaches cannot further refine the timing of the infarcts. These events remain, in nearly all cases, sudden and unanticipated. An accurate, temporally refined early warning system with a prediction range of a few days will therefore allow clinicians to therapeutically intervene and observe patients at risk in anticipation of such events and thus, significantly reduce their probability and the associated fatality. Such warning systems require continuous recordings of vital data, however the majority of medical devices providing such data are not appropriate and feasible for long-term patient monitoring. Making use of data collected by wearable, widely-used smart watches, our AI-based technologies provide clinicians with the urgently needed warning systems. It further will enable health-care providers and insurance companies to assess risks in a more accurate, quantitative manner. It is however noteworthy that the capabilities of our technologies are not limited to cardiovascular diseases and can be extended to neurological and psychiatric disorders. Our approach has been validated by a set of preclinical studies, generously funded by European funding agencies such as the Horizon2020 program, and published in peer-reviewed, high-impact journals.","We collect high-resolution physiological and behavioral time-series from each patient and use machine learning algorithms and methods from statistical mechanics to characterize the disease dynamics. Similar approaches have been successfully applied in academic research to characterize ecological state transitions and diagnostics of psychiatric diseases. In contrast, our company develops and utilizes these technologies to identify early warning signs in an application-oriented manner. In other words, our goal is not only to characterize the current state of the disease but to credibly predict the probability of critical events within narrow time-frames.

Through rigorous large animal preclinical models, our innovative products have demonstrated superior performance and safety compared to existing market offerings. Our sealants' simplicity in delivery makes them an ideal choice for the rising trend in minimally invasive procedures. Presently, we are in the process of our Series A fundraising round, which will pave the way for obtaining 510(k) approval","BioDevek has created a series of smart materials — materials whose physical forces sense and titrate surface chemistry and adhesive force to the local environment — to prevent complications associate with internal surgeries. In the same way that pharmacology can be tuned to individualized to create personalized medicine, these materials can personalize their tssue:material interactions to each individual, individual target and individual disease/altered state. As such, the force of adhesion of a specific formulation to the lung, colon, heart, bone etc. will be titrated to idealized adhesive force required. The company has leveraged a decade of academic and scholarly development in the Edelman and Artzi Laboratories at MIT and has a number of issued patents (licensed to BioDevek) and publications in highest impact materials science journals. Moreover, we have worked in parallel on different programs partnering with strategic partners such as Ethicon and Boston Scientific, targeting indications covering cardiovascular sealing and endoscopic polyp resection. These joint development programs have been most successful in defining the application space and allowing Biodevek to generate its own intellectual property. We completed a comprehensive set of studies of the biomaterial platform including biocompatibility following FDA recommendations and both acute and chronic large animal preclinical models to demonstrate the efficacy of our hydrogel solutions. The most immediately applicable and exciting application is infusion of the gelling adhesive through and endoscope to cover wounds left in mucosal surface at the time of e.g. polyp excision. We are poised to initiate scale-up manufacturing of our sprayable formulation for endoscopic application following polyp resection — a procedure that exponentially grows in numbers for early screening of colon cancer. We have completed a series of animal studies in pigs showing that our formulation prevents complications and provides with a pro-healing microenvironment.","We have created an adhesive sprayable liquid bandage that can be delivered using standard endoscopes, and creates a thin but strong layer on top of the wound that protects and reinforces the wall integrity while minimized the risk of bleeding. Our material displays similar properties to the underlaying tissue, the intrinsic features of the polymers used, can modulate the wound microenvironment limiting inflammation while accelerating wound healing without the need of any drug. We have demonstrated the biocompatibility of our technology in vivo models and its efficacy in pig studies, where the group treated with BioDevek’s material displayed no bleeding or perforation over 2 weeks. We have brought the attention of several strategic partners working in the field of endoscopy and they have validated our solution in their models with excellent results.",MIT-licensed technology | MIT faculty as founder | BioDevek was founded by professor Elazer Edelman and Natalie Artzi.

The second problem is product quality. If the culture is not well mixed, in some parts of the bioreactor the culture conditions is non-optimal leading to nonhomogeneous culture. Obviously, this can be solved by using a more intense agitation, but this could damage the culture (producing shear stress). 3. When working at large scales, the energy consumption of bioreactors can represent a significant cost. 4.

However, there are currently no at-home, quantitative, and blood-based hormone monitors which allow women to assess their ovulatory and menstrual health. There are existing ways for women to measure their hormone levels which inadequately satisfy this need. For instance, during IVF, women schedule venous blood draws with clinics hospitals. These require inconvenient and time consuming in-person visits, aren’t always covered by insurance, are painful, slow to return results, and have expensive operating costs for clinics in skilled personnel, niche instrumentation, and space to operate.

Meaningful data is collected, analyzed and made accessible to users, doctors and medical professionals for personalized healthcare. The first product integrates into women's brassieres and learns about the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are currently a major cause of death worldwide and it is alarming that even though more women than men have died of CVDs since 1984, women continue to be under diagnosed. With a world class, diverse team, our vision at Bloomer Tech is to be at the forefront of solving major global health issues by empowering people with technology, providing impactful data and experiences that reduce health risks. Contributing to longer, happier and healthier lives. The team connected by personal stories which are our motivation to tackle the cardiovascular disease problems. We are inspired by Amelia Bloomer's legacy, she is a women's rights advocate from the 1800s who transformed the way we wear clothes, as corsets from her time were really damaging women's health. People often do not know what is happening in their bodies until it is too late. Majority of fatalities occur because they are not informed in a timely manner and the experts we turn to are not fully equipped to change this reality. It is a well know fact that Doctors need key information about their patients and at times find it very difficult to know what is happening in a person’s body in a day to day setting. We see this every as 52% of our global population struggle with cardiovascular disease and more with ailments that are threats to their lives. The first circuits are being embedded into women’s bras and will informs users in an easy to read way about their Electrocardiogram, pulse rate, lung sounds, accelerometer, respiratory breathing and heart rhythm. The app will inform people on key metrics used to tackle cardiovascular disease and provide interactive tools to help women improve their health at the start. the information gathered can be given to doctors at the users’ choice to help doctors better help patients. Although cardiovascular diseases lead to more deaths than any other disease combined (malaria, cancer, aids, infectious disease)– the tools to gather information and helps patients are not properly utilized over a long period of time. Even with medical patches, wearable’s, and implantable loops in circulation which has grown the market exponentially to over $80bill, even people with serious heart ailments do not use them consistently.

BLUE DOT MOTORWORKS Edit,https://bluedotmotorworks.com,"Blue Dot Motorworks is addressing the elephant in the room when it comes to decarbonizing road transportation: no matter how fast we transition new vehicle manufacturing to EVs, the existing fleet won't turn over fast enough to align with climate targets. Something has to be done with the billions of conventional cars that will be on the road for the next three-plus decades, and our universal plug-in hybrid retrofit kits represent a paradigm shift in cost-effectiveness and scalability. By achieving a price point that delivers a return on investment in just a few years and an installation process that can utilize third parties, we will bring electrification retrofits into the mainstream. We have demonstrated the feasibility, practicality, and usability of our technology with road-going prototypes, have had our first patent issued, and have generated 360 pages of patent material around greening existing vehicles. We aim to do nothing less than make a significant dent in global carbon emissions while unlocking an untapped, multi-trillion dollar market.","Even if conventional vehicle production were completely phased out by 2028, the resulting vehicle emissions would consume over 300% of the remaining 1.5 C carbon budget. To close that gap through new EV production, we would have to double the size of the automotive industry. That additional production would cost 38 trillion dollars, which is about 12X the relative spending of the Apollo moon program. We’d have to scrap 11 trillion dollars-worth of perfectly good cars, more wealth than the US lost in the 2008 financial crisis. We’d have to increase battery production 700% faster than current projections, and install 3 million additional chargers, representing 99 years of installation at the 2019 rate. We would incur 18 gigatonnes of carbon emissions from the manufacturing of additional vehicles, with each one taking over six years of driving to break even from the embodied carbon, at least 75% of the time we have to achieve the first halving of emissions. From the customer perspective, EVs remain financially out of reach for the majority of the population, and charging infrastructure is not mature enough in many parts of the world to support mass EV ownership.","The Narwhal and the Humpback, from Blue Dot Motorworks, can together convert almost any light-duty vehicle into a plug-in hybrid. Their ground-breaking, vehicle-agnostic designs can be mass produced at the largest of scales to achieve the lowest possible price point. The simple and consistent installation process is easy to train, enabling the use of third parties. Each system includes a safe and cobalt-free battery pack, an electric motor that drives the rear wheels of the vehicle, a charger, a user interface, and optional electric accessories, such as a power steering pump.

CALLALY Edit,,Callaly is a new British femcare company based in London named one of the “period-positive startups revolutionising the multi-billion pound feminine care industry by the Independent and one of the UK's 50 leading D2C companies by the IAB.,"The brand is built upon the coexistence of dichotomies: everyday and fantasy, tradition and innovation, design and versatility -- creating an elevated experience that defies trade-offs. Senreve believes women are multifaceted and can have it all -- no compromise necessary. Senreve was born when, as rising female professionals, we found ourselves in search of the perfect luxury handbag. The company was seeking something that was beautiful and feminine, but also versatile enough to keep up with our everyday lives. However, Senreve discovered most designer bags didn’t fully consider all of these needs, so we decided to take matters into their own hands. With Senreve, women are now free to go about their day with ease, empowered to better live their busy, modern lifestyles. From phone and wallet to laptop and lipstick -- finally a beautiful bag that knows how to multitask. What Senreve has created is a seamless blend of elegant design, impeccable quality and innovative construction. The bags are sleek, structured and designed to carry your life in style. They're also lightweight, travel-friendly and just as appropriate for a business meeting as they are for happy hour or brunch. Bags are made from 100% genuine Italian leather with a pebbled finish. Each bag is expertly handcrafted to look and feel soft and supple, structured yet lightweight, and durable and water-resistant. We’ve also invested heavily in a top quality micro-suede lining that most other brands deem too expensive to use. For us, a top-quality product begins with exceptional ingredients. Craftsmen constructing SENREVE bags today have worked with top luxury brands for over 50 years. They employ a difficult inside-out technique that only a few factories in the world are able to do. Senreve believes combining this master craftsmanship with design and innovation sets SENREVE apart as the future of luxury.","Since the tampon became available in the 1930s, its design has remained largely unaltered – despite most women needing to use a separate liner 'just in case'​. We thought it was time for a change, so we’ve launched the Tampliner®, the first patented product to completely rethink how a tampon could work.

CHARM INC / BEYOND CORAL FOUNDATION Edit,,"CHARM is a coral farming robot. CHARM combines scientific research with computer automation to reduce costs, save time, and grow resilient coral reefs that can survive the future ocean conditions. CHARM is designed to grow coral at economies of scale and remains affordable for island-nations and developing countries.","A new method and apparatus for coral husbandry called CHARM has been invented with the ambition to grow coral at economies of scale. It does so by combining machine automation with science based methods to create industrious repeatability. ​CHARM’s machine vision, robotic end effectors, artificial intelligence, deep learning capabilities, and easy-to-use interface will help manage the vast number of coral polyps and reef species in a nursery of the future. ​Each year, a coral polyp will attempt to birth a coral baby. Coral babies can be grown in nurseries and in great quantities. Through sexual reproduction, two different coral species may hybridize, which can bring a positive increase in natural genetic diversity. If they are reared successfully, coral can be selectively bred for higher survival rates in the warmer ocean temperatures of the future. This is very good news! Corals can also asexually reproduce. Through a surgical process called, micro-fragmentation, a coral colony will rapidly repair its damaged tissue when cut. Coral polyps multiply across the wound, like clones, at an increased rate due to the immediate stress.","Research shows it takes 4,000 hours to clean and maintain 10,000 coral fragments-- equal to 3 people working full-time for 1 year. To save our reefs, we estimate that 100,000 corals will need to be planted everyday. That is a lot of labor! The average cost to grow 1 coral is $27. Currently, staff labor accounts for 50% of annualized costs at coral nurseries. Most nurseries are understaffed and rely on volunteer labor to tediously clean away algae from around coral. To minimize nursery expenses and maximize coral health, CHARM aims to automate the repetitive tasks in coral farming such as cleaning, feeding, assembling, and cataloguing. For example, a user selects a program sequence from the online portal to clean baby corals. When prompted, the CNC machine carriage switches to the corresponding tool--in this case, a soft bristle brush--and begins to clean away algae automatically until completion. The software and onboard camera can detect corals and clean them safely on a regular basis. To serve its principal objective, CHARM is designed to help restore coral reefs around the world. The design uses commercially available parts to integrate into existing industry methods. This innovation is affordable and accessible for global communities who are interested in coral farming. WHY CHARM? Aquaculture for coral offers considerable promise for restoring reefs and preserving biodiversity. Asexual reproduction accelerates coral growth up to 50 times its natural state. Corals can hybridize, which also increases natural genetic resilience. CHARM is intended to yield healthier and higher volumes of coral, reduce handling stress to coral, minimize exposure to pathogenic factors, increase growth rates, and improve cataloguing techniques.

Our vision is for the sustainable production of therapeutics & alternative foods that are accessible & affordable to all populations for the betterment of global health & nutrition.","Biomanufacturers face challenges in efficiently producing biologics & cellular agriculture proteins at scale & affordable costs. Protein production is hampered by the difficult-to-express nature of these proteins, and challenges in retaining protein functionality and proper folding, assembly, & secretion from the cell. The unpredictable & poorly understood biological code for producing foreign proteins leads to compromises on product quality (glycosylation, purification, etc) to achieve protein expression. These challenges are not exclusive to recombinant proteins but also affect mRNA therapeutics. In particular, tissue-specific expression of therapeutic mRNAs in their target tissues remains a challenge that dampens efficacy. Cracking this biological code is vital for enabling sustainable & cost-effective protein production.","We discovered that cells respond to stress & changing environmental conditions by reprogramming their biology for producing proteins. Stress includes over-expression of foreign proteins in host cells, as well as changes in production vessels & scale. The stress response is unique to the cell line, target protein, & production scale, and cannot be predicted solely using AI. We developed a platform technology (Epi-MAX platform) that leverages stress-induced cellular reprogramming to re-engineer cells & their genes for boosted protein production. Our platform uses omics tools to measure the cell’s stress response and a proprietary software platform to re-program the cell for boosted protein production.

Initial focus is on developing vaccines and vaccine adjuvants for infectious diseases and oncology indications, with plans to initiate clinical development in 2024.","Combined Therapeutics’ platform, MOPCTx, is comprised of a modified mRNA encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle. The UTR region of the mRNA is modified to contain miRNA binding sequences. Due to the differential expression of miRNA in different cells and tissues in the body, our platform, as an example for vaccine applications, can be targeted to express the antigen preferentially at the site of injection, while protecting key vital organs such as the heart, liver, and kidneys. Cytokines are endogenous signaling proteins that are part of the immune system. They provide the cells with instructions that are integral in helping the body respond to an infection and launch an appropriate immune response. For example, IL-12 is a cytokine secreted by antigen presenting cells that allows for the recruitment, activation, and proliferation of specific immune cells, making IL-12 a key factor in successfully mounting an adaptive immune response during vaccination. Combined Tx’s approach is to co-administer IL-12 mRNA with an antigen, to improve the vaccine response, otherwise known as molecular adjuvantation.","MIT faculty as founder | Robert Langer -- Co-Founder, MIT Institute Professor, Professor of Chemical Engineeirng and Biological Engineering Dan Anderson -- Co-Founder, MIT Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering","40 Guest Street, Boston, MA, 02135 • romain_micol@sloan.mit.edu, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","May 1, 2017",1-9,Biotech,Biotechnology,,,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/2691,2025-08-22T13:03:56

Energy use is a fundamental enabler for improved quality of life worldwide, yet historically it has come at an extreme cost to the environment. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) is combining proven physics backed by decades of government-funded fusion research with a revolutionary superconducting magnet technology to accelerate the path to commercial fusion energy.","Development of this carbon-free, combustion-free source of energy is now on a faster track toward realization, thanks to a collaboration between MIT and a new private company, Commonwealth Fusion Systems. CFS will join with MIT to carry out rapid, staged research leading to a new generation of fusion experiments and power plants based on advances in high-temperature superconductors -- work made possible by decades of federal government funding for basic research. Once the superconducting electromagnets are developed by researchers at MIT and CFS -- expected to occur within three years — MIT and CFS will design and build a compact and powerful fusion experiment, called SPARC, using those magnets. The experiment will be used for what is expected to be a final round of research enabling design of the world’s first commercial power-producing fusion plants. SPARC is designed to produce about 100 MW of heat. While it will not turn that heat into electricity, it will produce, in pulses of about 10 seconds, as much power as is used by a small city. That output would be more than twice the power used to heat the plasma, achieving the ultimate technical milestone: positive net energy from fusion. This demonstration would establish that a new power plant of about twice SPARC’s diameter, capable of producing commercially viable net power output, could go ahead toward final design and construction. Such a plant would become the world’s first true fusion power plant, with a capacity of 200 MW of electricity, comparable to that of most modern commercial electric power plants. At that point, its implementation could proceed rapidly and with little risk, and such power plants could be demonstrated within 15 years, say Whyte, Greenwald, and Hartwig.",,"MIT-licensed technology | MIT faculty as founder | MIT alumni as founder | Zachary Hartwig MIT Assistant Professor of NSE; Robert Mumgaard - Ph.D. 2015, S.M. 2015 Nuclear Engineering - mumgaard@mit.edu; Daniel Brunner - Ph.D. 2013 Nuclear Engineering, Post-Doc 2014 PSFC - ; Brandon Nils Sorbom - Post-Doc 2017 PSFC, Ph.D. 2017 Nuclear Engineering","c/o The Engine 501 Massachusetts Avenue Cambridge MA 02139, Massachusetts • brunner_dan@alum.mit.edu, mumgaard@mit.edu, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Sep 1, 2017",1-9,Energy Tech,Energy,,,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/3525,2025-08-22T13:05:37

Using fluorescence microscopy, the microbial contents of each microwell are identified, and the behavior of each coculture is evaluated over time using a phenotypic readout. With many millions of data points analyzed, we have developed machine learning models that reliably nominate novel, functional combinations of microbes.

The beachhead market within this segment is comprised of air charterer companies in the United States. This market is a $400 million market and was selected based on the relatively lighter regulation, the emphasis placed on avoiding delays, and the flexibility of company budgets and purchasing decisions. The first follow-on market is commercial airliners, a $2.6 billion segment. Next, we plan to move on to European ($1.6 billion) and Asian ($1.3 billion) commercial airline markets. Finally, we will tackle other verticals including wind turbines, cars, and driveways. Every year, the airline industry devotes billions of dollars and considerable manpower to de-ice airplanes. To make matters worse, they employ a slow and harmful chemical treatment. De-Ice has created a novel technology that uses electric systems in lieu of these harmful chemicals. Our product will be manufactured directly onto airplanes, completely eliminating chemicals from the de-icing process. Additionally, our method entirely eliminates the manual labor associated with the process, and removes the ice in a fraction of the time and cost. The target business model consists of a one-time up-front installation fee, for retrofitting airplanes with our de-icing system. We will be responsible for developing and maintaining the technology, however we will outsource the actual manufacturing to a specialized third party.

The pharma industry is undoubtedly one of the world's largest, with worldwide revenues topping one trillion US dollars. However, its effectiveness is in question, as the exponentially increasing cost of drug discovery and development has resulted in fewer new drugs reaching patients at a much higher price. At the origin of this problem, lies our inability to exhaustively search the astronomical drug-like molecules space for an efficacious drug to a disease-related biological target. To enable future development and reverse the decaying trend, we need a paradigm shift in the form of efficient exploration methods. DeepCure's AI algorithms analyze a trillion drug candidates from the proprietary virtual library and accurately point out the most promising ones while accounting for the dynamic nature of the target and optimizing the required ADMET properties. DeepCure's AI helps identify novel optimization steps that would escape the eyes of even the most experienced medicinal chemist.

DUALITY TECHNOLOGIES Edit,https://www.dualitytech.com,"Duality Technology's breakthrough innovations empower Secure Digital Collaboration. Duality Technology's products empower multiple parties to collaborate and gain new insights while keeping sensitive data protected. Duality products seamlessly integrate with your existing systems, making it easy to set up collaborative projects quickly and at scale. Our product platform allows you to securely query third-party data, use AI tools and analyze data, all while utilizing encrypted data or model","Data security and privacy is a major and continually growing concern for modern society in general and businesses in particular. Regulatory concerns such as HIPAA and GDPR oblige companies to limit the sharing of data, both externally and internally. These sharing limitations restrict companies’ abilities to derive valuable insight from data, such as developing new cancer treatments if genomic data could be shared, or identifying fraud and other financial crimes by allowing banks to more effectively scan suspicious transactions. Furthermore, regulatory and security concerns limit companies’ abilities to leverage the elasticity and cost-effectiveness of cloud computing environments. Using homomorphic encryption schemes, a user is able to encrypt data then send the data to an less-trusted server that executes an encrypted computation, such as an encrypted query on local data. The server then returns the encrypted result of those computations to the client. Finally, the user decrypts the result. Usability has been a guiding principle of Duality since our founding, based on the prior experiences of our co-founders using data science tools in production and in deployed encrypted computing solutions for early adopters in the US government. Hence, Duality’s platform is designed from the ground up to be usable and easily adopted by production data scientists, surpassing our competitor’s products in ease-of-use and practical effectiveness. A prime example of where Duality’s solution has been particularly effective is in the domain of privacy-preserving computing on genomic data. Duality was funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) of the NIH to develop an encrypted computing solution that would enable Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) on encrypted genome data at scale for use by cancer researchers at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). Duality’s solution surpassed all expectations of our NIH sponsors, developing techniques that scale linearly to perform GWAS operations on “live” encrypted genomic data.","Duality Technologies leverages secure computing techniques, such as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), that offer the possibility of general computing on data while it remains encrypted, thus providing both privacy and security that satisfy regulatory requirements. FHE allows sensitive data to be encrypted such that arbitrary programs can be securely run over the encrypted data without decrypting it, yielding encrypted output. When decrypted, this output is equivalent to the result of running the original program on the unencrypted data. Practical and usable FHE leads to a sea change in computing, thus allowing privacy-preserving analytics and machine learning on encrypted data. For example, it would enable computation to be outsourced to untrusted computing resources such as cloud-based servers while guaranteeing the privacy of data used in that computation. The basis of homomorphic encryption schemes used by Duality Technologies comes from recent advances in lattice-based cryptography. As such, homomorphic encryption schemes used by Duality Technologies are known to be post-quantum, meaning that they are resistant to quantum computing attacks. Between its functional use and security properties, there is a mature, vibrant and rapidly growing community of homomorphic encryption researchers and users. Duality Technologies co-founders help to lead the industry standards consortium for FHE.",MIT faculty as founder | MIT alumni as founder | Co-Founder and Chief Cryptographer Vinod Vaikuntanathan - Associate Professor at MIT EECS Co-Founder and Chief Scientist Shafi Goldwasser - Professor at MIT EECS,"5 Marine View Plaza #301, Hoboken, NJ, 07030 • krohloff@dualitytech.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Sep 16, 2016",25-49,Data/Analytics,Software,$20-100M,,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/3391,2025-08-22T13:29:08
DUST IDENTITY Edit,http://dustidentity.com/,DUST Identity links physical objects to their digital records - securely.,"DUST -- the Diamond Uncloneable Security Tag -- is a proprietary technology which utilizes nanodiamonds to create an unclonable identity layer on any object. An optical scanner and cloud-based infrastructure provides an interface to the object identity and provenance. DUST ensures that trusted data and verifiable products are used and traced across their full lifecycle. HISTORICAL INFORMATION: Formerly Diamond Nanotechnologies, Inc., DUST Identity is a Boston-based early stage venture focused on developing advanced microscopy tools for neuroscience and biology. The technologies stemmed out of scientific research that we conducted at Columbia University and MIT on nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamond. As this research transitioned from fundamental studies to development of practical imaging and sensing tools, there was a growing interest in our tools from physicists, chemists, biologists and neuroscientists; thus, we decided to spin-off the company. This allows us to focus on our users needs and deliver the best tools for their applications. DUST Identity continues a strong relationship with early adopters in a variety of scientific disciplines. This has enabled an applications-driven development approach to solve some of the greatest challenges of our time such as simultaneous, real-time imaging of the action potential of thousands of neurons with single-neuron specificity and single-molecule tracking in live cells. Recently, Diamond Nanotechnologies was awarded a multiple-year contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop an optical imaging system that uses diamond nanosensors. This system can potentially enable high-speed parallel recording of neural activity in brain tissue in vitro and in vivo of animal models.","DUST Identity developed a process to engineer nano-scale synthetic diamonds with quantum properties, known as ""nitrogen vacancies,"" that allow us to detect the diamond's orientation. After enhancement, the diamonds are embedded into physical objects using common polymers.","MIT faculty as founder | MIT staff as founder | MIT alumni as founder | Ophir Gaathon is CEO & Founder -- Postdoc research scientist at Columbia University & MIT (Quantum Photonics Group) - ophir@dustidentity.com and 617-329-5043; Jonathan Hodges, Ph.D. / VP of Engineering -- Ph.D. in NSE; Ori Spigelman, Product Operations - ospigelman@dustidentity.com and 617-510-0498 Dirk Englund, former Visiting Professor David Cory","85 Wells Ave, Newton, MA, 02459 • primmler@dustidentity.com, sludwig@dustidentity.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Jul 21, 2011",50-99,Cybersecurity,Technology,$20-100M,#supplychain #security #nanotech #cybersecurity #IoT #blockchain #counterfeit #trackandtrace,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/4259,2025-08-22T13:29:47
DXLAB INC. Edit,https://www.dxlab.bio/,"DxLab Inc. (DxLab) is a biotech startup, spun out of MIT and Harvard in September 2020, developing and commercializing a next-generation point-of-care (POC) diagnostic solution for rapid, on-site detection of dangerous pathogens. Combining proprietary platform technology with novel target detection and signal processing methods, we are advancing a pipeline of rapid POC tests.","The mission at PathAI is to transform, accelerate and improve cancer diagnosis and cancer care by integrating pathology machine learning / artificial intelligence (AI) with traditional pathology methods in both research and clinical labs. By leveraging recent advances in computational processing power and AI, the conventional methods of pathology are disrupted and improved, leading to meaningful improvements in medicine and patient outcomes. PathAI's revolutionary approach provides the highest level of standardization, accuracy and precision in pathology available today, delivering solutions to researchers and empowering pathologists with decision support tools.","We have developed a new POC testing solution that utilizes a proven isothermal amplification technique, enabling highly accurate detection of targeted nucleic acids in as little as 10 minutes. Our testing solution does not involve any sample purification steps and instead works directly with crude specimens, simplifying sample collection and processing. The key feature of our solution is a portable, POC testing device with a small form factor (only weighing 5.1 lb.) that uniquely provides eight reaction chambers (i.e., test bays) that can be independently controlled in a random-access manner. Coupled with our “one-pot” assay design for simultaneous detection of targeted nucleic acids and control nucleic acid in a single reaction tube, our testing device enables up to eight samples to be tested at once on-the-spot. This testing throughput is several-fold higher compared to any existing POC testing systems (most of which can only test one sample at a time). Key advantages of our solution include: ● Simple operation – Our test only involves four simple steps (sample collection, sample elution, sample transfer, device operation) without any need for expensive reagents or equipment for sample purification. The testing device provides clear on-screen instructions on how to run the test and automatically performs the amplification reaction on the samples. The device also performs signal processing and interpretation to provide unequivocal test results that do not involve any subjective signal interpretation. Various built-in controls in the test ensure that integrity of the amplification reaction is maintained, minimizing the rate of false-positives and false-negatives originating from various interfering sources. ● Proven device platform – Our testing device has been developed in partnership with Axxin, the ISO 13485 accredited experts in the development of diagnostic platforms. The device is built on the same core technology and platform that have been used in other FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic devices, such as Abbott’s ID Now device. ● Rapid testing time – Our testing solution provides a test result in 10-15 minutes for positive samples, 25 minutes for negative samples. ● Flexibility and adaptability – The core technology used in our testing solution is readily adjustable to target different nucleic acids, allowing for rapid development and deployment of new pathogen detection tests. ● High-throughput testing at the POC – Up to eight samples can be tested per device. Each of the test bays on our device can be controlled independently in a random-access manner, making it possible to test the samples sequentially or in parallel. This is especially useful in the POC settings, since samples can be tested as soon as they are collected, instead of waiting for all eight samples to be collected before running any test or waiting for previous sample testing to finish before starting the next test. To confirm the capabilities of our solution, we designed our amplification reaction to target SARS-CoV-2, which could provide highly accurate detection of the virus on our testing device in as early as 10 minutes.

"ELECTRIFIED THERMAL SOLUTIONS, INC. Edit",https://www.electrifiedthermal.com/,"Electrified Thermal Solutions (ETS) is working to electrify and decarbonize industries globally. To move on from fossil fuels, the world needs a new approach to heating. Electric heating from wind and solar farms today is frequently less expensive than burning fuel. All that is missing is a technology that can practically deliver that energy as reliable, high-temperature heat. To solve this, we’re developing the Joule Hive: a new energy storage technology that turns unreliable wind and solar e","ETS is developing the Joule Hive: a new energy storage technology that converts surplus zero-carbon electricity into heat. The stored heat can replace fossil fuels in industrial processes such as cement or iron production, or run a turbine for on-demand electricity at a fraction of the cost of lithium-ion batteries. The innovation of the Joule Hive stems from a novel joule-heating system, built from electrically conductive ceramics developed at MIT. With its unique ability to store gigawatt-hours of energy, hot as flames, the Joule Hive may act as a drop-in replacement for fossil fuels to decarbonize the energy consumption of any co-located industrial plant.","The Joule Hive technology innovates on 100 years of ceramic energy storage, and is inspired by the hot blast stoves of the steel industry. It is a large mass of electrically conductive ceramic bricks, which is joule-heated by surplus electricity from wind, solar or nuclear plants, to temperatures approaching 2000oC. When the energy is desired, air or another gas is blown through the Joule Hive, and blended to produce whatever temperature is required by the co-located boiler or furnace. Joule Hive can be sized to produce constant heat to megawatt or gigawatt-scale processes. Joule Hive may also be attached to existing power plant technologies, allowing them harmonize with renewables, e.g., by storing surplus solar energy in the Joule Hive during the day and running the turbine with it at night, completely free of combustion. Joule Hive also makes process emissions capturable without expensive gas separation in the steel and cement industries, approximately 15% of global emissions.","MIT-licensed technology | MIT alumni as founder | Daniel Stack, CEO of Electrified Thermal Solutions, Inc.

However, in many cases the required dose is significantly higher than the 1.0 - 1.5 mL limit of self-injection devices which introduces the need for concentrated protein drug solutions. Unfortunately, injectable high concentration protein solutions often cannot be achieved because the protein solutions become too viscous when > 100 mg/mL.

This is a game changer for employers who want to protect their employees from heat-related injuries, professional and amateur athletes who want to maximize their performance, and researchers who need to monitor subjects during clinical trials. The patch relays data in real time to an app, which can alert users to potentially dangerous health conditions such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance or stress, thus preventing injury. Our machine learning algorithms can combine the sensor data with environmental and other data to accurately forecast dangerous conditions to further protect against injury.","As extreme heat becomes more and more common around the world, workers across a wide variety of industries, including construction, mining, oil & gas exploration, logistics, landscaping, firefighting and more, are being exposed to far greater risk of severe or even fatal heat injury. Employers wish to protect their workers from this type of injury while at the same time ensuring that they are able to work effectively. Epicore’s connected hydration patch provides individualized, real-time monitoring and feedback on each worker’s current state of hydration, their body temperature, movement, and their electrolyte and cortisol levels, to detect heat stress, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances before they become severe, alerting the worker to take a break, rehydrate and replenish electrolytes.

In certain places like California, industrial utility rates have tripled in just the last few years. That forced certain manufacturing businesses to move or even shut down. One of the reasons behind that rate increase is the lack of storage in the grid. The supply of power can be intermittent, so to match it with the demand, that energy needs to be stored. Otherwise, there’s an expensive imbalance in the grid, and the people paying for it are the customers. While some storage has been added to the grid in the recent years, we need to be integrating it more than 20 times faster to support the energy transition. With EQORE, we can distribute the cost and benefits of storage across thousands of businesses, all while helping them reduce their bills.","Our product is a smart battery system installed on the site of a business.

We are developing treatments and diagnostic assays to improve the effectiveness and long-term outcomes of treatments for the deadliest and most therapy resistant cancers: pancreatic, colorectal, non-small cell lung, and ovarian. Recently, it has become accepted in the scientific community that populations of malignant cells are not homogenous, they have hierarchy. Some of the cancer cells divide rapidly but some do not, some of the cancer cells are sleeping. They are in the quiescent state. This is especially true of solid tumors in which the cells in the outer layers are proliferating, but the inner volume comprises a large proportion of quiescent cells, frequently as a result of inadequate nutrient supply and oxygen deprivation (hypoxia). Hypoxic regions have long been known to be resistant to chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Tumor hypoxia, as a target for chemotherapy, is currently an active area of research. Moreover, when cancer cells are under stress from either chemotherapy, anti-angiogenesis therapy, specific targeted treatment, or radiation, cancer cells often go to “sleep”, or use quiescent as a niche to hide. After the completion of treatment, these cells can acquire resistance to the current treatment, begin growing and cause cancer recurrence.

We have developed a novel metal manufacturing process that deposits molten drops of metals to build 3D shapes, special coatings or even electronics. We have 5 laboratory demonstrators and we are currently advancing applications with industry partners.","A critical manufacturing gap exists for refractory metals, particularly tungsten. The traditional method, powder metallurgy, is restricted to the production of basic shapes, failing to meet the complex demands of fusion, nuclear, and hypersonic technologies. On the other hand, legacy additive manufacturing methods, while providing freedom of design, cannot meet the structural requirements due to microcracks that occur due to high thermal impact. These industry limitations force engineers to compromise on design, hindering the potential performance and efficiency of critical components. Ultimately, this directly constrains development and slows down essential progress in these high-performance sectors. In addition, there are significant challenges for adopting metal additive manufacturing, rooted in the complexity of legacy systems: high investment costs, limitation of materials, and handling costs of powder feedstock. These complexities limit the scalability and accessibility of the technology, making it difficult to achieve cost-effective production at scale.","Fluent Metal addresses the critical manufacturing gap for refractory and multi metals, particularly tungsten in combination with copper, with our innovative molten metal droplet deposition technology. Analogous to inkjet printing, our process precisely deposits molten metal droplets from wire feedstock—including tungsten and pure copper—on demand. Crucially, our melting process occurs away from the built component, eliminating melt pool formation and drastically reducing negative thermal impact. This minimizes microcracks, enabling the production of complex, structural 3D parts of complex shapes.

Using technology developed at MIT that enables aluminum to split water, we can store and deliver hydrogen on-demand safely at >5x the volumetric energy density of liquid hydrogen and >3x that of methanol and ammonia. Our ability to use low-value aluminum waste means our process is also the most economical way to generate green hydrogen for less than $0.50/kg. Taken together, Found Energy provides modular fuel packs that have both the energy density and economic incentive to actually compete with conventional hydrocarbon fuels and feedstocks.","Innovation in renewable energy production and short-term energy storage is accelerating, but renewable energy transportation is often overlooked. Energy storage technologies like electrochemical and thermal batteries are critical for this transition, but due to their low energy density, their use is limited to short-distance transportation and stationary applications (e.g. home and grid storage). Consequently, many potential energy markets (e.g. maritime shipping, industrial hydrogen, remote power generation) are currently left out of the renewable energy transition due to a technology gap in energy transportation - existing storage solutions fail to compete with fossil fuels on energy density, cost, and safety.","Aluminum waste is abundant and highly energy-dense, with roughly double the volumetric energy density of diesel. A stable aluminum fuel can be produced directly from scrap using a fully recoverable and recyclable catalyst. This fuel reacts with water to produce clean hydrogen gas, heat, and an aluminum oxyhydroxide byproduct, which is environmentally benign and used in various industrial processes.

GENERAL PROGNOSTICS INC. Edit,https://www.gpx.ai,"Approximately 25% of heart failure (HF) patients experience readmissions within a month after discharge, leading to significant costs for patients, insurers, and hospitals. Suboptimal medication contributes to this issue, as patients' conditions may worsen subtly, requiring additional therapy for stability, yet physicians' limited remote monitoring capabilities impede timely intervention. Implanted monitoring devices have proven to improve outcomes, but are limited in use to a very narrow segmen","Hospital readmissions for HF patients are frequent, as 25% of these patients will be readmitted to the hospital in less than 1 month after being discharged and hospital stays are costly for patients, insurers, and especially hospitals. A major reason for this is that these patients are often sub-optimally-medicated. This happens because though a patient may be optimally medicated at discharge, within a few days their condition may imperceptibly worsen, requiring additional therapy to remain stable. Unfortunately, physicians’ limited remote monitoring ability renders them insufficiently informed about patients’ conditions, causing the patients to be sub-optimally-medicated. The most recent published data about HF patient medication rates show that less than 1% of HF patients are optimally medicated. Therefore, optimal medication of these patients remains a major problem to be solved with timely insight from non-invasive, passive, and easily interpreted monitoring technologies, which in turn will reduce patient rehospitalizations and save cost.","With extensive experience in med-device and blood diagnostics, GPx is well-positioned to tackle the challenge of reducing HF hospital readmissions. We have direct access to numerous hospitals, evident from the overwhelming sign-ups for the upcoming FDA pivotal study. Through the current clinical study, we have enrolled over 235 patients, accumulating more than 80 years of patient data. This has enabled the creation of a comprehensive digital and blood biomarker database for HF patients, larger than that of Roche and Mayo Clinic.

These algorithms demonstrate impressive performance, with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 99.5%.

GENERATE Edit,http://www.generate.design,"Generate is a tech-enabled architecture platform. We are committed to the sustainable development of cities, and specialize in streamlining the design and delivery of mass timber through our pre-vetted building solutions and generative systems.","Rapid urban densification translates into urgency to both increase and optimize global building supply. While the world runs a deficit of millions of housing units, cities face at once this extreme housing shortage and ambitious environmental goals. Major U.S. cities have plans to build hundreds of thousands of housing units and millions of square feet of commercial buildings. In parallel, they are starting to adopt zero-net carbon standards for all new public buildings by 2030. These twin pressures—coupled with sky-high housing prices—showcase the need for 21st-century building technologies to be agile, cost-competitive, and capable of meeting aggressive environmental goals. Global forests would benefit tremendously from supplying their regional construction markets, while concurrently functioning as ecosystems for carbon storage and helping cities attain their carbon goals. Yet most forests remain overgrown and undervalued, due to lack of investment and management. Buildings account for 40% of all greenhouse gas emissions (through operational and embodied energy), indicating an urgent need for energy-intelligent and economic building systems. Mass timber buildings act as carbon sinks through CO2 storage, low emission of greenhouse gases, low pollution and waste. Adopted at scale, mass timber would increase the economic value of forests; galvanize their proper management; and unlock an affordable housing solution. Yet, the development of replicable and geography-adaptable, mass timber building systems remains of high technical risk, as few project stakeholders have the tools to design with these digitized systems in a cost-effective way—which means they end up opting for carbon-emitting systems, like concrete.","Generate is a first-of-its-kind design platform that enables the creation of full-fidelity, pre-engineered sustainable mass timber designs within minutes. Generate offers a one-stop solution for the design, engineering, and construction of mass timber buildings, by empowering architects, engineers, builders, and owners to create accurate, affordable, and sustainable mass timber design solutions with real building products and systems. Our platform streamlines the design process and eliminates the need for manual drawings and calculations, enabling architects and engineers to quickly turn their designs into constructible mass timber buildings; and manufacturers to link their products directly to real projects. Generate allows project stakeholders to design in a code, cost, carbon, and product-aware space that links design to manufacturing, short-circuiting the linear process of project delivery. Our pre-vetted building solutions and generative tools aim to reduce mass timber construction costs while increasing construction speed, leading to an increase in built mass timber projects, and enhanced demand for carbon-sequestering building products. This approach synergistically increases the presence of sustainable manufacturers, and the output of energy-efficient, high-density, and biophilic affordable housing—in turn leading to the creation of new, sustainable infrastructure; better-utilized forests; and new, mission-driven jobs nation- and world-wide. Generate’s approach significantly reduces upfront time and costs to integrate mass timber systems into projects, while helping restore the health of our forests, as part of a renewable material, closed-loop economy.

HERONAI Edit,https://heron-ai.com/,"We want to be the world's most user-friendly data analytics hub specializing in dark data. Where we help create a 360-degree view of your business automatically in 5 minutes. We offer businesses unparalleled, high-quality, innovative, and automatic data analytics that seamlessly integrate with multiple industries to revolutionize how businesses drive mission and revenue.","In the current landscape, data analytics stands as a highly lucrative industry, primarily due to the emphasis on big data. Two decades earlier, an accounting firm managing 3,000 clients would typically handle up to 1 TB of data. In stark contrast, today's modern firms grapple with over 15 TB of data per client. This exponential increase is attributed to the advent of digitalization, evolving regulatory demands, and the advancement of analytical methodologies. Over the next 18 months, our strategic focus is directed towards individual Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), as well as small to mid-sized accounting firms that are keen on embracing technological advancements. Our target market encompasses firms with average annual revenues of around $25 million and a typical staff size of 250. These firms are already employing data analytics tools such as Excel, QuickBooks, Tableau, or Power BI, but are actively seeking more efficient alternatives to enhance their operations. In a typical accounting firm, between 5 to 20 professionals allocate about 20 to 60 percent of their work time to analytics tasks, encompassing areas such as financial performance, tax, compliance, and Business Intelligence and Reporting. However, the complexity of these tasks often leads to a scenario where over 80% of the data becomes 'dark data' - unutilized and overlooked. This not only results in missed opportunities and revenues but also demands substantial investment in specialized training, costing firms an average of $18,000 to $90,000 per individual annually. Our proposed solution is a product designed to automate these analytical tasks. It aims not to replace staff but to substantially enhance their productivity. This could potentially translate into significant annual savings for firms, ranging from $140,000 to $960,000. The cost of integrating our software into these companies is set at $3,000 per month, offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for firms looking to navigate the complexities of modern data analytics.","At HeronAI, we've pioneered the development of the first fully automated, centralized end-to-end dark data analytics system tailored for accounting firms. This groundbreaking system is not just for specialists; it's designed to be accessible to all. Our AI-driven technology empowers accountants with actionable insights, autonomously analyzing client context data to generate customized dashboards and reports, thereby saving time and boosting revenue. Consider the case of Susan, an accountant at RockTree. She previously spent extensive hours on manual data entry and analysis. With HeronAI, she can now swiftly integrate comprehensive retail business data, including web and social media analytics, leading to vital insights like identifying non-optimal staffing during peak hours. Our system, which is 99% more advanced than existing solutions, leverages recursive retrieval to uncover deeper, interconnected insights from hierarchical documents. We're revolutionizing Large Language Models (LLMs) through our Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) system, offering cost-effective, privacy-conscious solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. Additionally, we enhance LLMs using company-specific data and ontologies for improved understanding and structured knowledge, making complex analytics tasks more efficient and intuitive.",MIT staff as founder | MIT alumni as founder | I am the CEO and I was a postdoc and am now research staff in DCM.

IMAGIRATION Edit,https://imagiration.com/,"ImagiRation is developing prescription digital therapeutics for children with autism based on the issued patent US20160210870. Our language therapy application MITA demonstrated excellent results in a 3-year observational study of 6,454 children with autism. Children who engaged with MITA showed 2.2-fold greater language improvement than children with similar initial evaluations. MITA has received FDA breakthrough device designation on 02/24/2021 (Q210093).","The CDC estimates that 1 in 54 children is affected by autism, a neurological disorder that disrupts early development in cognition and communication, leading to impairment in cognitive and social functions, and difficulty in acquiring new adaptive behaviors. Up to 70% of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience language difficulties. There is a broad scientific consensus that early and intensive language therapy has the greatest promise of significantly improving outcomes. However, the availability, quality, and general funding for early intervention programs is often lacking, leaving newly diagnosed children without adequate and sufficient therapy during the most critical early period of their development. Over the last decade, ImagiRation has developed a highly innovative adaptive language therapy application for children with ASD, Mental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA). In the manuscript published in the journal Healthcare, ImagiRation reports the result of a 3-year clinical study of 6,454 ASD children ages 2 to 12 years. Children who engaged with MITA showed 2.2-fold greater language improvement than children with similar initial evaluations. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.0001). The MITA application includes both verbal and nonverbal exercises aiming to develop Prefrontal Synthesis (PFS), the neurological mechanism responsible for the juxtaposition of mental visuospatial objects into novel combinations at will. Most people assume the presence of innate PFS abilities in all individuals. However, therapists, researchers, and caregivers working with children with ASD appreciate the challenges of PFS acquisition. Even when language therapy is administered daily, some children never build up the neurological connections essential for PFS. Failure to acquire PFS ability results in a lifelong deficiency in understanding complex language such as, spatial prepositions, recursion, and, fairytales, which require the listener to imagine unrealistic situations. Among individuals diagnosed with ASD, the prevalence of lifelong PFS paralysis is 30 to 40% and can be as high as 60% among children enrolled in special ASD schools. MITA verbal activities train PFS by using higher forms of language, such as noun-adjective combinations, spatial prepositions, recursion, and syntax. For example, a child can be instructed to put the cup {behind|in front of|on|under} the table or take animals home following an explanation that the lion lives above the monkey and under the cow. In every activity a child listens to a short story and then works within an immersive interface to generate an answer. Correct answers are rewarded with pre-recorded encouragement and animations. MITA nonverbal activities aim to provide the same PFS training visually through implicit instructions. For example, a child can be presented with two separate images: that of a train and a window pattern. The task is to mentally integrate the train and the window pattern and to match the result of integration to the picture of the complete train positioned among several incorrect trains. The child is encouraged to avoid trial-and-error, focusing instead on integrating separate train parts mentally, thus training PFS. Different games use various tasks and visual patterns to keep the child engaged.","MITA is based on the issued patent US20160210870. MITA uses verbal and nonverbal adaptive exercises, that emphasize the ability to juxtapose mental visuospatial objects. This ability called prefrontal synthesis can be impaired in children with autism, leading to what is commonly described as stimulus overselectivity or “tunnel vision.” Improving prefrontal synthesis has been shown to leads to vast improvements in general learning.","MIT alumni as founder | Jonah Elgard, ImagiRation co-founder is MIT Alumni","9 Michael Rd, Boston, MA, 02135 • imagiration@gmail.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu, vysha@bu.edu","May 15, 2014",1-9,Digital Health,Health Care,Under $2M,"autism, ASD, language delay, language therapy, imagination, theory of mind",https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/27283,2025-08-22T15:20:45

We make factories smarter with machine learning, combining process monitoring and real-time analytics to keep production lines running. Unplanned downtime and quality defects cost process manufacturers 20% of their production potential. This problem is particularly pronounced among process manufacturers such as steel, aluminum, or paper producers, which generate $2 trillion in global output every year. To maximize uptime and reduce scrap, operators must know in real-time when and where errors occur. However, industries reliant on visual inspection are underserved by IIoT platforms that do not integrate both machine vision and streaming data analytics. Most advanced analysis tools that do chase advanced insights are designed solely for data scientists. Our SaaS platform uses live monitoring, visual analysis, and machine learning to deliver actionable insights to operators and engineers, in real time.","Our work at IndustrialML began with the realization that existing Industry 4.0 platforms could not integrate key sources of information required for actionable analysis. As a result, the first area where we had to develop capabilities was in building the necessary connectors, interpreters, and gateways to integrate data from multiple sources (sensors, enterprise IT, and video sources) into a modern data backend. The next challenge with using existing platforms was their emphasis on data from machines or similarly structured sources, but these alone cannot provide an understanding of process outcomes. Knowing a motor or sensor is operating below optimum range is only useful if there is context on the resulting impact on the end-product. Adding machine vision enables us to flag defects in real-time, thus closing the loop between the quality of production results and the machine parameters that produced good results.

Every AccuCirc kit comes with its own surgical marking pen and procedure starts with this critical step to ensure the most accurate outcome. Unlike some male circumcision devices that leave the tip of the penis unprotected, the AccuCirc uses a protective shield that is placed on the tip of the penis and protects the newborn during the procedure. The foreskin holder is another safety feature built into this device. It allows for very accurate positioning of the foreskin prior to making the incision which allows for a precise amount of skin to be removed every time providing for very accurate and consistent results. The AccuCirc also uses a proprietary internal circular blade that is controlled precisely by the device and ensures that the penis is protected before, during, and after the procedure. The device is equipped with a safety guard that helps prevent removing too much tissue during the procedure, ensuring an excellent outcome.","MIT alumni as founder | David Tomlinson, Class of 1991, Mechanical Engineering, Company Founder S.B. 1991 School of Engineering (Major: Mech Eng - Coop) - tomlinson@alum.mit.edu","1101 Curtis Corner Road, Wakefield, RI, 02879 • anikatomlinson@gmail.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu, tomlinson.iw@gmail.com","Jun 1, 2016",1-9,Digital Health,Health Care,$2-10M,,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/14391,2025-08-22T15:26:46

"JAXON, INC. Edit",https://www.jaxon.ai/,"Jaxon autonomously labels raw data for training other machine learning applications on new concepts, contexts, and domain-specific terminology.","Artificial intelligence is currently powered by armies of humans. Machines cannot read natural language like humans do, so massive efforts are underway to manually label the data necessary for training machine learning models to understand human language. Typically, millions of examples (sentences, tweets, emails, documents, etc.) are needed, and even more for deep learning. Jaxon reduces manual labeling requirements by 90% or more, accelerating the process by months and slashing the cost by over 75%. Augmenting this small amount of labeled data using traditional and cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, Jaxon provides huge quantities of labeled training data as well as fully-trained, highly-accurate models that can immediately be used for text classification. Jaxon also adapts to change as fast as data comes in, allowing models to be retrained as often and as quickly as needed to maintain and improve accuracy.","Data is fed into Jaxon through an elaborate assembly line that dissects, analyzes, and refines itself on the fly. Jaxon dives into the data, discovers correlations, and looks for patterns and connections. Dozens of algorithms work together to assign the best possible labels to the original data. Jaxon is a machine learning solution, focused on training machines to more accurately process raw text. Using a combination of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, Jaxon generates a neural “meta-learning” model, used to label text and synthesize training data. Through Jaxon’s Studio, users can curate the model(s), impart constraints, and iteratively tune the pipelines to optimize the performance of the downstream machine learning model being trained.","MIT alumni as founder | Both cofounders (CEO & CTO) went to MIT.

This breakthrough approach dramatically lowers the cost (100x) and size (10x) requirements for remote wireless sensor deployment. Using standard local networking protocols, our system leverages commodified, low-cost receivers and obviates the need for new infrastructure. Our turn-key platform provides everything necessary to deploy and manage very-large-scale sensor networks enabling up to 65,000 endpoints with a range of up to 200 meters between wired access points. The system is capable of continuously streaming up to a megabit per second while using less than a 100 microwatts of endpoint power. We combine this backscatter technique with multi-mode energy harvesting capabilities (RF, thermal, kinetic, PV) to create extremely low-cost, “forever sensors” that are completely battery and maintenance-free.

NuVu’s pedagogy is based on the architectural studio model and geared around multi-disciplinary, collaborative projects. NuVu provides students the opportunity to work collaboratively with academic and professional experts (PhDs/alumni from MIT and Harvard as well as leading professionals) to solve real-world problems. NuVu nurtures creative problem solving, team collaboration across networks, oral and presentation skills, technological proficiency, systems thinking, adaptability, risk-taking and imagination; All critical for student success in the 21st century. NuVu’s pedagogy is informed by the architectural design Studio where a coach guides students in hands-on problem-solving to solve complex, comprehensive problems. The Studio model uses exercises to build skills and integrates students’ knowledge in a final project. Within each multidisciplinary Studio, students explore problems rigorously by focusing on one project for two weeks. A Studio Coach mentors students to develop their project through an iterative process over the course of the Studio. Students confront the small and large contexts within problems as they are exposed to complex, ‘messy’ situations. The NuVu Team continuously evaluates students through deskcrits and final reviews. Develop Real-World Solutions for the World -- Taught within the multidisciplinary framework of the design Studio rather than traditional subjects, NuVu students acquire a highly personalized understanding of the world and how they relate to it and can fully participate in it. They develop multiple solutions to problems and learn the importance of moving from one solution to the next, combining, exploring and thinking of the possibilities. They also learn how to change their perspective on an issue quickly. They learn that solutions depend on perspective, and only by understanding an issue from multiple perspectives can they fully explore the terrain of possibilities. Iterative Process, Constant Feedback -- The iterative process, or process of refining an idea, product or solution, in the design studio is intended to provide students with continual feedback from NuVu Coaches and Staff on performance as well as product. NuVu students also experience working in an intense, feedback-rich environment that provides them with information and support for continuous self-evaluation, reflection, and improvement. Learn in New Ways -- NuVu challenges students to learn in new ways: analytical thinkers are inspired to explore their creative selves, while creative students expand their capacity to think and learn analytically. NuVu capitalizes on the immense resources of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University to focus on hands-on problem solving, encourage an inventive culture, promote peer teaching and learning, and cultivate students’ curiosity. Portfolio-Based Assessment -- Instead of grading, NuVu uses a portfolio-based assessment. A portfolio serves as a compilation of student work done at NuVu over the course of the term, semester or full year and is meant to show the student's growth over time and development of key academic and life skills (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, communication, research, quantitative reasoning and analysis). Each NuVu student is provided with their own online profile on NuVu's online platform where they document and present their work. At frequent periods during the term, NuVu's team works with the student to assess how far the student has developed since the beginning of the term. The portfolio-based assessment helps make learning and assessment relevant to students' lives.","At the core of JumpStream products is the ability to leverage and connect technology that our customer already has.

KNOWLEDGE AI INC. Edit,,,"Established in the fall of 2010 in Cambridge, MA, NuVu is an award winning full-time innovation studio for high school students. NuVu’s pedagogy is based on the architectural studio model and geared around multi-disciplinary, collaborative projects. NuVu provides students the opportunity to work collaboratively with academic and professional experts (PhDs/alumni from MIT and Harvard as well as leading professionals) to solve real-world problems. NuVu nurtures creative problem solving, team collaboration across networks, oral and presentation skills, technological proficiency, systems thinking, adaptability, risk-taking and imagination; All critical for student success in the 21st century. NuVu’s pedagogy is informed by the architectural design Studio where a coach guides students in hands-on problem-solving to solve complex, comprehensive problems. The Studio model uses exercises to build skills and integrates students’ knowledge in a final project. Within each multidisciplinary Studio, students explore problems rigorously by focusing on one project for two weeks. A Studio Coach mentors students to develop their project through an iterative process over the course of the Studio. Students confront the small and large contexts within problems as they are exposed to complex, ‘messy’ situations. The NuVu Team continuously evaluates students through deskcrits and final reviews. Develop Real-World Solutions for the World -- Taught within the multidisciplinary framework of the design Studio rather than traditional subjects, NuVu students acquire a highly personalized understanding of the world and how they relate to it and can fully participate in it. They develop multiple solutions to problems and learn the importance of moving from one solution to the next, combining, exploring and thinking of the possibilities. They also learn how to change their perspective on an issue quickly. They learn that solutions depend on perspective, and only by understanding an issue from multiple perspectives can they fully explore the terrain of possibilities. Iterative Process, Constant Feedback -- The iterative process, or process of refining an idea, product or solution, in the design studio is intended to provide students with continual feedback from NuVu Coaches and Staff on performance as well as product. NuVu students also experience working in an intense, feedback-rich environment that provides them with information and support for continuous self-evaluation, reflection, and improvement. Learn in New Ways -- NuVu challenges students to learn in new ways: analytical thinkers are inspired to explore their creative selves, while creative students expand their capacity to think and learn analytically. NuVu capitalizes on the immense resources of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University to focus on hands-on problem solving, encourage an inventive culture, promote peer teaching and learning, and cultivate students’ curiosity. Portfolio-Based Assessment -- Instead of grading, NuVu uses a portfolio-based assessment. A portfolio serves as a compilation of student work done at NuVu over the course of the term, semester or full year and is meant to show the student's growth over time and development of key academic and life skills (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, communication, research, quantitative reasoning and analysis). Each NuVu student is provided with their own online profile on NuVu's online platform where they document and present their work. At frequent periods during the term, NuVu's team works with the student to assess how far the student has developed since the beginning of the term.

Centralized lab-based testing has complicated consequences in animal disease management, particularly mastitis. It is a very common yet costly disease that presents a global challenge of lost revenue, antibiotic overuse and food waste, with an estimated cost of $32B each year. The problem is that mastitis is hard to detect, and it spreads easily among the herd. Frequent and timely milk testing for individual cows is crucial to spot mastitis early on. However, the current centralized lab-based milk testing is labor-intensive, human error-prone, and has a long waiting period. Between the testing days, farmers have little information about new infections or if those cows with mastitis are improving or deteriorating.","Labby has developed Milkey: a cow-side milk testing device coupled with an AI and software service, as shown in Fig. 1. It includes 3 modules: an optical milk analyzer with embedded machine learning, a data portal with customized data visualization for herd health and milk quality management, and veterinary care for best practices and recommendations by our animal care partners. The company’s competitive advantage lies in its ability to use its tech stack (choice of spectrophotometers) to enable cost-effective materials and allow broadband applications, optical techniques to examine light interactions on nano, microscopic and molecular levels, and its algorithm engine to enhance the optical data quality and discover previous unknown biomarkers.

Others use direct microscope counting methods. None of these can be done on farms in an economical, sustainable, and scalable manner. Effective calibration is another competitive advantage against some of our instrumental competitors.

Leuko is working to allow patients and their caregivers to monitor their immune system recovery in the home, through a revolutionary tabletop non-invasive, finger-based blood cell monitor, reducing the stress and risk of outpatient chemotherapy. White blood cells are also the key to detect acute infection. A simple test for these cells is sought throughout the resource poor regions of the world; especially where HIV-associated bacterial co-infection is endemic. This niche alone would account for approximately 40 million tests per year. There are approximately 4 billion people living in rural regions of our planet who currently have little or no access to testing for infection, which we've set out to provide.

PointCheck performs this test in 1 minute by using proprietary portable optics and AI algorithms that collect and analyze videos of the blood flow from superficial capillaries through the finger’s skin. Because no blood is required, PointCheck enables, for the first time, frequent assessments at home, flagging critically-low cases to the care team so that early treatment (e.g. growth factors, prophylactic antibiotics) can be delivered.

This problem is especially critical for companies transitioning from prototype to full-scale production—a phase where many fail to cross the ""valley of death."" Even with a successful prototype, scaling up often introduces unexpected bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and cost overruns that can jeopardize the entire venture. While much attention is given to the “zero to one” challenge of developing new technologies, the real economic impact lies in the “one to one thousand” problem—scaling production efficiently and cost-effectively. The earlier companies can understand their system’s constraints, costs, and trade-offs, the greater the positive impact on their bottom line and time to market. LineLab enables manufacturers to predict dynamic behavior, identify risks, and optimize investment decisions before committing capital, ensuring smoother scale-up and long-term operational success.","LineLab uses novel mathematical formulations to solve one of the most complex problems in manufacturing: how to design a system that scales efficiently. Traditional tools—spreadsheets, heuristics, and even advanced simulations—struggle with this challenge because they only validate a given design rather than prescribe the best one. Our technology flips this approach from right to left, meaning we start with the desired production outcome and mathematically determine the optimal system configuration to achieve it. This method provides orders-of-magnitude improvements over traditional approaches by solving for thousands of variables simultaneously, considering constraints, trade-offs, and uncertainty in a single model. Unlike discrete event simulation (DES), which relies on trial-and-error, LineLab’s multi-variable mathematical optimization rapidly converges on the best possible solution, ensuring faster, more reliable, and cost-effective scale-up decisions.

LITHIOS INC. Edit,https://www.lithios.xyz,"Lithios aims to revolutionize global lithium production by enabling access to untapped, low-grade brine resources using an environmentally friendly, low-cost electrochemical process called Advanced Lithium Extraction (ALE). The Lithios ALE system consists of a layered stack of membranes, electrodes, current collectors, and flow channels, where it continuously performs selective electrosorption (or electroextraction) of lithium ions from a feed solution and electrodesorption (or electrorelease) into a recovery solution. Ion exchange membranes are used to enhance selectivity, control the transport of ions, and—like neurons in the brain—generate voltages from salinity differences between the feed and recovery solutions. Compared to the best competitor Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technologies, Lithios ALE replaces harsh chemical reagents with renewable, programmable electrons, thereby reducing environmental hazards, carbon footprint, and costs (both CAPEX and OPEX) by up to 30%. Lithios ALE seeks to open vast new lithium resources in the US and around the world, including magnesium-rich and geothermal brines, spent batteries, and ultimately seawater, the planet’s largest and most equitable lithium resource.",We are developing a new technology for ALE from tough brines using electrochemistry. The technology enables selective and economical lithium capture from previously untapped resources.,"In contrast to traditional processes or competing Direct Lithium Extraction methods, the Lithios ALE technology can produce lithium from untapped brines and resources, which contain comparatively high concentrations of sodium, calcium, magnesium, and other competing ions. Unlike DLE technologies based on adsorption, ion exchange, or solvent extraction, the ALE electroswing technology uses only electricity and eliminates the need for excess freshwater or harsh chemicals and solvents. Moreover, the ALE technology is unique in its ability to operate as a galvanic cell that generates electricity by “reverse electrodialysis,” which can be used to drive the process. Based on these features as well as our technoeconomic modeling, the significant upfront cost reductions in materials, reagents, and operating requirements should translate into very favorable project economics at scale.","MIT faculty as founder | MIT alumni as founder | Founding team includes myself (PhD, chemical engineering '22) and Prof. Martin Z.

LYDIAN Edit,http://lydianlabs.com,"Lydian is pioneering novel technology that uses captured CO2, water, and renewable electricity to produce a sustainable, drop-in alternative to today’s fossil-based jet fuel that reduces lifecycle emissions by up to 95%. Uniquely built for cost, scale and the modern grid, Lydian's modular technology delivers superior energy efficiency and operates intermittently, solving for the greatest challenge e-fuels face - their significant electricity demand. Within four years of the company's founding,","If SAF isn’t scaled quickly, aviation could account for 20% of global emissions. The biofuels we have today are not scalable enough. e-SAF has the greatest opportunity to enable net zero operations, but early projects have been far too costly, take too long to construct, and are limited to running on continuous power or stored hydrogen, both of which add significant cost and complexity. Lydian is redefining this category by proving that e-SAF can be cost competitive with biofuels in the near future and can scale much faster without feedstock concerns, to ultimately decarbonize aviation and enhance energy resilience. Lydian is uniquely approaching e-fuels as both a chemical process and a power systems asset. We are the only player that has designed a fully-integrated plant solution for the unique challenges of e-fuels, namely the need for rapid deployment, cost-effectiveness at smaller scales, and the ability to operate the entire plant in an intermittent fashion to take advantage of the very cheap electricity input needed for cost-effective SAF, which is not available around the clock.","We’ve developed breakthrough modular CO2-to-fuels technology to create the lowest cost e-fuels on the market. Our proprietary syngas catalyst and reactors (syngas and FT) enable 50-70% lower cost e-fuel plants which are the first purpose-built to follow intermittent renewables. How our CO2-to-SAF technology works: We take water, CO2, and renewable electricity and convert those inputs into a synthetic crude oil that is further processed into fuels and chemicals. Our process innovates on two well-understood steps: the reduction of CO2 via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction to produce syngas and the hydrogenation of carbon oxides via Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis into hydrocarbons. Lydian has designed its proprietary RWGS and FT units with a focus on minimizing cost through process intensity and modularity while maximizing energy efficiency, single-pass yield, and flexibility (i.e. turndown), all of which are uniquely enabled by the breakthrough performance of Lydian’s proprietary catalysts and reactors.",,"570 Rutherford Avenue, Charlestown, MA, 02129 • amanda@lydianlabs.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","May 3, 2021",10-24,Energy Tech,Energy,$10-20M,"e-fuels, e-saf, SAF, aviation, cleantech, decarbonization, energy innovation, energy resilience, climate tech",https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/40686,2025-08-22T16:15:33

MACROCYCLE TECHNOLOGIES Edit,https://www.macrocycle.tech,"MacroCycle is commercializing a patented technology that will enable circular plastics with zero carbon emissions. Through an innovate chemistry-based approach, we can take lower value PET plastic waste and upcycle it to virgin-grade quality with 90% less energy consumption. The remaining 10% can then be electrified with renewable energy to achieve recycling with zero-carbon emissions. Due to the simplicity of this technology, MacroCycle can produce this high-quality pellets at a much lower cost","Plastics are useful materials, but they are also associated with significant environmental toxicity and climate change. About 8 million tons of plastic per year leak into rivers and oceans. Production of plastics released >850 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere in 2019, representing now roughly 4.5% of the global CO2 output. Plastic recycling can reduce the environmental impact and carbon footprint of plastics production. However, our existing scheme of recycling relies on Mechanical Recycling, which is an inherent “downcycling” into lower quality products given the degrading impact and inability to re-establish the original polymer. Molecular recycling, also termed advanced or chemical recycling, has the potential to enable fully circular plastics. However, these processes break every functional bond along the polymer, for example ester bonds in PET, which then require extensive separation and re-polymerization, leading to high energy demand and limited climate benefit. Big plastic using brands therefore either struggle to find recycled plastic on the market, or have to choose from the few upcoming chemical recyclers that cannot offer a significant carbon footprint reduction. The plastics crisis is a critical matter to resolve as we combat climate change and mitigate future generation’s exposure to everlasting microplastics. This requires not only consumer change and regulation, but especially profitable technologies to create truly circular plastics economy.","Our patented process technology, which exploits thermodynamics and catalysis, can upcycle a variety of plastic wastes into high quality “bottle-grade” plastic, with much lower energy demand and carbon footprint. We achieve recovery of intermediate species from plastic waste (PET bottle flakes, polyester textiles and other functional polymers) followed by re-polymerization of these intermediates to produce high quality plastics with a much simpler and more efficient process, while removing color and other impurities with a single solvent. Therefore we can dramatically reduce the energy demand and carbon footprint of our upcycled plastic by 70-80% compared to conventional PET production and other advanced recycling technologies, with the potential to be fully decarbonized given that all unit operations and temperatures required are electrifiable. Our upcycled PET has been tested for commercially relevant material properties. This output material will satisfy a broad range of customers in the plastic packaging market place and help them decarbonize while fulfilling their circularity pledges.","MIT alumni as founder | I am a Sloan '23 graduate and my co-founder, Jan-Georg, is a postdoc in the chemical engineering department.

Magma’s core breakthrough is a low-power magnetic bearing that brings incredibly stable and efficient operation to satellite mechanisms. Specifically designed for control systems, Magma reduces on-board vibrations 95% to illuminate fine details in images and overcome pointing challenges in laser communication. In addition, the technology opens new flywheel energy storage capabilities that can be built into existing control hardware, expanding benefits to high-power payloads including radar-based imaging and directed energy. Magma has received grants from NASA and the National Science Foundation, and has Letters of Intent including the US Space Force, MAXAR, D-Orbit and the Air Force Research Lab.","Magma Space is solving four satellite performance bottlenecks. First, laser communication is 200x faster than radio and is needed to meet the 14x increase in data transmitted to and from space over the next decade. However, unprecedented pointing accuracy is required for its 10,000 narrower signal. Today, laser communication is only run at a fraction of its potential. Second, remote observation is transitioning towards hyperspectral and very-high-resolution imaging, which are highly susceptible to vibrations that blur images and limit mission usefulness. Third, control systems are a primary cause of premature system failure when ball bearings within reaction wheels (which maneuver and point the spacecraft) degrade over time until complete blockage. Fourth, current Li-ion batteries are highly inefficient and struggle to supply high-power radar-imaging and directed energy, leading to burdensome charging cycles and oversized satellites.","Magma Space has developed a new magnetic-bearing reaction wheel for satellites. Three to four reaction wheels are virtually every satellite and are used for maneuvering and pointing. At a high level, the wheel spins one way and the satellite spins the other way. While these wheels are used for positioning, they’re a primary emitter of vibrations due to ball bearings.

MAGNOLIA ELECTRONICS INCORPORATED Edit,http://magnoliaelectronics.com,"Magnolia has novel techniques, and circuit designs, to parallelize the sampling of analog signals into digital signals. Our techniques sidestep the constraints of the Shannon-Nyquist sampling relationship and allows us to open new possibilities for high-speed, low power, and relaxed-tolerance ADCs. We have built and tested prototypes that demonstrate the techniques work, and achieved a 100x increase in effective sample rate at no loss of resolution.","Analog to digital signal conversion occurs everywhere we move between physical phenomena and the abstract realm of digital logic. Denser data streams require wider signal bandwidths, and ever faster sampling devices are needed to process those streams. As serial sampling devices run faster, they take more power, sacrifice resolution, and require more precise engineering and manufacturing. The ADC process is ubiquitous, but our technique is particularly relevant to devices that contain sensors and communication components limited by speed, cost, and power availability. Devices in industries including telecommunications, radar, satellites, and medical imaging are likely market candidates.","Our control circuits allow simple, cheap ADC samplers to coordinate their operations with very little overhead.

Increases in chronic diseases and an aging population have led to an increased need for high-quality medtech. Because local production can’t meet demands, around 85% of medical technologies in the region are imported. LatAm laws require local companies to import medtech products, so US manufacturers typically have to partner with distributors to avoid opening offices in each market. Local distributors are constantly searching for innovative technologies to remain competitive and improve health outcomes within their local markets. Even though this presents US-based manufacturers with great opportunities, the process of exporting devices is currently labor intensive, time-consuming and manual. The distribution processes in this region is complex, has country-to-country fragmented regulatory landscapes and contrasting culture and language. All these factors result in manufacturer's getting a low ROI. Tens of expert interviews and our years of experience confirm that these barriers scare manufacturers from devices to this region. Sadly, this leads to lack of access to innovative healthtech for millions of patients in LatAm and poor healthcare outcomes in many countries.","Medikana is a platform that automates and simplifies medical device commercialization internationally.

MESPAC is a cloud-based service that uses SatEO data, in-situ data and advanced AI to provide metocean and environmental surveys for offshore wind developers. The quality is equivalent to in-situ surveys, but the duration is reduced by at least 50%.

For auctions, you don’t have that time available. b) Historical databases: provide access to databases of historical datasets. But the space definition is low, as data is generally provided on 50km x 50km grids c) Modelling techniques: phisically model the wind and or other metocean variables propagation.

"METHENA, INC. Edit",https://methena.com/,"Introduction Methena, Inc. (https://methena.com/) is a newly formed U.S. based education platform company. It is founded by three co-founders, Paul Shih, Dr. June Huang, and Dr. Charles Hsu. Methena secured an exclusive partnership with IEG Global Corporation (https://ivyedugrp.org/), a U.S. based 501(c)(3) non-profit in early 2021, where Methena could sell all of IEG’s educational products. Our Methena® APP serves as a marketplace with a “experiential tutoring” services focus.","Company and Opportunity With a GPA of 2.76 and 2.58 from high school and university respectively, our CEO, Mr. Paul Shih, was able to get admitted into The Johns Hopkins University and Columbia University for his undergraduate and master’s degree. He is, therefore, a strong believer in enabling students to “find their passion”, and the importance of extracurricular activities. Methena focuses on three key product offerings: extracurricular activities, train the trainers, and tutoring services. Methena’s certified short-term top university programs (extracurricular activities), both online and offline, targets students from grades 3-12, university students, and young professionals. We also provide online and offline training for bilingual and international school teachers (train the trainers). We started with customers in Asia, and we plan to expand to the U.S., Europe, and Southeast Asia market with our APP launch. With our proprietary “experiential tutoring service” (tutoring services), students will not only score high on their AP, IB, or subject tests, but also receive firsthand information from the universities that they want to attend in the future. We plan to become “the Uber in global tutoring”. Industry and Market Analysis The global tutoring market will reach $173.4 billion by 2027, with $46.9 billion and $61.4 billion in the U.S. and China respectively. There are currently around 10 online tutoring companies averaging $50 million in annual sales. However, none of them have the ability to work directly with top universities in the U.S. to offer supplemental experiential learning programs, enabling students to develop their leadership, research, and communication skills at a younger age. For extracurricular activities, Methena continues to leave competitors behind with official programs at Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, Caltech, Berklee, and Brown. These residential and online programs offer certificates directly from each university, and faculty members’ recommendation letters are written on the university’s behalf, not on an individual basis. In addition, we also host the first ever Ivy League business school competition for high school students, the Model Entrepreneur® Competition. With U.S. universities shifting from the reliance on standardized testing, the role extracurricular activities play in the admission decision process will only continue to carry more weight. Our train the trainers program is the only program allowing teachers to be taught by Columbia, Harvard, MIT, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Caltech faculty members. In addition, we bridge international teachers with local school educators to exchange best practices and address cultural challenges in teaching. All of the teachers will also receive a certification of completion from the host university each year. With over 800 university and professional tutors and counting, our tutoring services aim to not only grow the company, but also helps U.S. university students to pay for their student loans. We have the highest pay rate for tutors and utilizes our proprietary tutor training processes to better streamline the tutoring experiences for both the tutor and students. Management and Operations Methena’s management team is consisted of professionals with background in the education, finance, technology, and medical field. With its flat organizational culture, all members are able to effectively share best practices amongst each other and leverage on each other’s domain expertise. All members of our management team have graduated from Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, MIT, UC Berkeley, Johns Hopkins, University of Pennsylvania, and are passionate in the field of education. As a true believer in “changing the world through education”, Methena combines technology and educational products to deliver effective educational services to students across the globe.","Implementation and Marketing For extracurricular activities, Methena plans to expand its university partners to 10 (currently at 8 with Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, Caltech, Berklee, Brown, and Pratt) by the end of 2022. These certified programs will be delivered physically (residential) and online (synchronous). Methena has been operating on a B2B sector, working with schools and agencies across Asia. With the APP launch and experiential tutoring services, Methena will be able to gain more traction directly with consumers. This will not only enable Methena to expand its presence in the educational arena, but also offer multitudes of educational products such as tutoring, passion finding projects, and freshman concierge services, directly to the consumer market on a global scale. The planned Methena APP launch date is April 30th, 2021 (Alpha release). Methena plans to first promote its APP through its 10,000 past customers in Asia, thus, this version of the APP will focus on Asia Pacific first. Methena plans to build up its marketing channels via CEO interviews, various educational discussion boards, online and offline hiring events, and the gamification of its “Methena Coin”, where users could earn actual scholarship sponsors for referring and purchasing of Methena’s products. A “rest of the world” version of the APP will then be launched with the same features. Financial Plan Methena received its first funding of $700,000 USD back in May of 2019. Before being funded, we were able to maintain profitable each year with a net profit of 28%. For this round, Methena is seeking $3 million USD in exchange for 30% of the company. Methena’s current customers’ average spend is between $5,000 to $8,000. However, with other more affordable products being offered through the APP, it will reach $3 million in sales for the year 2021, $5 million for 2022, and $10 million for 2023. In order to achieve this, we are not seeking pure investors, but investors who could provide value on one of our three product lines. Use of fund: 24% on the APP 10% on business development 20% for operation costs including hardware 46% on SG&A Methena will reach a $500 million valuation in three years, as its management team continues to build up wing-to-wing proprietary educational products for students seeking to study in the U.S. globally. Conclusion Methena has been blessed with the support from Harvard, Columbia, Stanford, Caltech, Berklee, Brown, and Pratt, as the only company in the world to run both online and offline certified programs. Leveraging on its 8 years of university partnerships, Methena plans to build up its presence in the education technology sector by offering more affordable products in the forms of extracurricular activities, train the trainers, and tutoring services. Methena plans to reach a market value of $500 million in three years, with over 30,000 customers worldwide.","MIT alumni as founder | Dr. Charles Hsu is an MIT alumnus, EECS PhD 1997.

NEOVIEWS Edit,http://neoviews.io,"The global sports sponsorship market was estimated at around USD 78 billion in 2022 while that for the sport analytics was at 2.45 billion in 2021 with a projected annual growth of 27.3% until 2030. We offer broadcasters and clubs with the innovative tools to add dynamic virtual advertisement contents to the original broadcast videos according to targeted audiences. We also offer football clubs, coaches and players sport analytics tools to understand themselves and opponents better than anyone else, both for game preparations and real-time tactical analysis. Our state-of-the-art 3D field reconstruction technologies require no infrastructure investment other than original video feeds and hence can be integrated to any existing systems. Our deep mathematical insights for camera/video calibration together with optimised AI and advanced Computer Vision enable us to reconstruct the 3D field at pixel-level accuracy and hence virtual advertisement and sport analytics are just straightforward extensions.","We address the problems facing the sport broadcasting advertisement and sport analytics through developing the same core technology on 3D field reconstruction without any additional infrastructure investment. Advertisement industry: the current broadcasting videos on big events such as the recent World Cup in Qatar are delivering the same contents to all viewers around the world. This means only a limited number of brands can appear in the billboards and these brands can often only be relevant to a small portion of the audiences while many other brands do not have the opportunity to advertise. In other words, the current system is not socially optimal and we aim to make it more efficient. This is done through virtual advertisements where the original broadcasting videos are added with different advertisement contents on the same physical billboards before broadcasting to specific audiences depending on their demographic and preferences. Sport analytics: Football clubs in major leagues are using more and more big data to gain and keep a competitive edge. To enable this, they either employ football video analysts to semi-manually turn football videos into insights or to buy data from some data provider such as OPTA, who in-turn employ a large labour force to do the video analysis (despite the use of some AI tools). The 3D field reconstruction enables us to identify the locations of the billboard, the players, the ball and obstacles and add the corresponding dynamical contents or to perform sport analytics.","The key technology is on video calibration based on our deep mathematical insights in the domain. Essentially, each video frame contains a number of clues, which can be detected by Advanced AI and computer vision tools, on the 3D real-world coordinates. The challenge is to turn these (noisy) clues into mathematical equations that govern the cameras’ operations and their parameters. A sport broadcasting video is often produced from a system of cameras, each has a changing set of parameters and our calibration task is to efficiently and accurately compute these coefficients from noisy data. While the virtual advertisement and sport analytics have been well-established, existing technologies often required hardware installation while our technology requires only the video feeds being broadcasted. Our AI and Computer Vision tools are guided by mathematical insights and hence are more computationally efficient, which allows us to perform real-time advertisement placement and in-game analytics.",MIT alumni as founder | I was an MIT PhD gradudate (2004-2009).,"ngtridung@gmail.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Mar 29, 2023",1-9,Data/Analytics,Technology,Under $2M,"Virtual advertisement; sport analytics; 3D reconstruction; AI, Computer Vision; Mathematical Optimization",https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/37100,2025-08-22T16:51:02

We are striving to address this issue through our AI-Enabled Nanosensor Platform technology which provides information to help screen and diagnose earlier, and measure treatment effectiveness. We aim to provide a feedback loop for therapy selection, dosing, frequency, and cadence, and guide decisions on combination therapies. This has the potential to help clinicians and therapeutic developers by providing earlier markers for treatment effectiveness, moving patients towards more effective treatments more quickly.","Our pioneering platform technology consists of arrays of carbon nanotube sensors which can uniquely identify a disease-specific spectral profile in response to molecular binding interactions to proteins and metabolites in patient blood serum.

Currently this technology has proven success with the US Military, however it has been prohibitively expensive to produce at scale for the commercial space sector. After many customer and stakeholder interviews, we have distilled the most important improvements to existing technology: 1. Interoperable across frequency bands, no longer requiring a different antenna for each use case. 2. Efficient, enabling 10 simultaneous connections through one device. This is a 20x improvement from existing parabolic antennas that require often two antennas tracking a single satellite to achieve comparable coverage. 3.

NuVu provides students the opportunity to work collaboratively with academic and professional experts (PhDs/alumni from MIT and Harvard as well as leading professionals) to solve real-world problems. NuVu nurtures creative problem solving, team collaboration across networks, oral and presentation skills, technological proficiency, systems thinking, adaptability, risk-taking and imagination; All critical for student success in the 21st century. NuVu’s pedagogy is informed by the architectural design Studio where a coach guides students in hands-on problem-solving to solve complex, comprehensive problems. The Studio model uses exercises to build skills and integrates students’ knowledge in a final project. Within each multidisciplinary Studio, students explore problems rigorously by focusing on one project for two weeks. A Studio Coach mentors students to develop their project through an iterative process over the course of the Studio. Students confront the small and large contexts within problems as they are exposed to complex, ‘messy’ situations. The NuVu Team continuously evaluates students through deskcrits and final reviews. Develop Real-World Solutions for the World -- Taught within the multidisciplinary framework of the design Studio rather than traditional subjects, NuVu students acquire a highly personalized understanding of the world and how they relate to it and can fully participate in it. They develop multiple solutions to problems and learn the importance of moving from one solution to the next, combining, exploring and thinking of the possibilities.

They learn that solutions depend on perspective, and only by understanding an issue from multiple perspectives can they fully explore the terrain of possibilities. Iterative Process, Constant Feedback -- The iterative process, or process of refining an idea, product or solution, in the design studio is intended to provide students with continual feedback from NuVu Coaches and Staff on performance as well as product. NuVu students also experience working in an intense, feedback-rich environment that provides them with information and support for continuous self-evaluation, reflection, and improvement. Learn in New Ways -- NuVu challenges students to learn in new ways: analytical thinkers are inspired to explore their creative selves, while creative students expand their capacity to think and learn analytically. NuVu capitalizes on the immense resources of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University to focus on hands-on problem solving, encourage an inventive culture, promote peer teaching and learning, and cultivate students’ curiosity. Portfolio-Based Assessment -- Instead of grading, NuVu uses a portfolio-based assessment. A portfolio serves as a compilation of student work done at NuVu over the course of the term, semester or full year and is meant to show the student's growth over time and development of key academic and life skills (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, communication, research, quantitative reasoning and analysis). Each NuVu student is provided with their own online profile on NuVu's online platform where they document and present their work. At frequent periods during the term, NuVu's team works with the student to assess how far the student has developed since the beginning of the term. The portfolio-based assessment helps make learning and assessment relevant to students' lives.",,"MIT alumni as founder | Founder- Saeed Aroda,PhD,Design & Computation.

Founded in 2010, the inspiration for Ekotrope’s optimization engine grew out of MIT Aeronautics and Astronautics Professor Edward F. Crawley’s quest for a way to find the most energy efficient design for a home he was building in 2009. Crawley found there was no way for his architect to easily analyze component tradeoffs to find the best energy and investment combination. The enterprising rocket scientist drew on NASA technology and assembled a select group of industry experts to come up with the Ekotrope solution.","Traditional separation technologies are effective, but very inefficient, because they rely on expensive heat to perform separation. Membranes changes the approach towards separations as they do not require heat and operate as molecular filters, separating molecules based on their size. However, commercial membranes have poor separation performance and high operating costs, which leads to poor adoption. At Osmoses we developed a materials platform and completely re-designed the materials that make membrane technologies. Our polymers have very rigid ladder structures, which leads to abundant porosity that we can leverage for precise molecular filtrations, achieving minimum energy consumptions and unprecedented separation performance that make Osmoses membrane a breakthrough technology for the future of separations.","MIT-licensed technology | MIT faculty as founder | MIT alumni as founder | We have an exclusive option agreement in place with the MIT TLO for IP owned by MIT.

PASCALL target market is estimated at $2B for the operating room (OR) in the US alone with adjacent future market as emergency department and ICU.","Upto 25% of elderly patients undergoing surgery receiving general anesthesia suffer from persistent post-operative delirium. This is because each patient has a different anesthetic requirements. However, current practice does not have a way to quantify this requirement, leading to imprecise dosing and subsequent delirium. Typically, patients of all ages may suffer some degree of neurocognitive impairment due to general anesthesia. This is mostly short-lived but can persist in elderly patients (> 65 years old), affecting their quality of life, lengthening length of stay at hospitals and adding downstream cost to the healthcare system.","PASCALL successfully completed development of its M0 wireless EEG monitoring platform and received FDA 510(k) clearance in May 2022.

PISON TECHNOLOGY Edit,http://pisontechnology.com,"The idea behind Pison Technology is to tap into the nerves of people with ALS using electromyography, or EMG, sensors and create a device that can translate those nerve signals into operational commands.","Pison Technology is creating a micromovement communication and control system to help people with ALS and other neuromuscular conditions who cannot speak or move their body. Our device is an EMG-based wearable sensor to control a laptop, phone and wheelchair. Even if a person has no ability to move, the nerves in the arms and legs are preserved and generate electrical signals. We capture the peak of that signal and translate it to a mouse click or keyboard press. Our device can help a person from initial diagnosis through progression of the condition. A person can wear 2-6 sensors for multiple channels of input to control the on-screen keyboard and mouse. The on-screen software will be customizable according to user preferences and level of tech savvy. It will be fully compatible with existing communication technologies like eye gaze. We have successfully tested prototypes on people who have lost arm and leg movement years ago and provided demonstrations to the X Prize, MIT, and MGH. The idea -- inspired by a remark made by one of the founder's mother -- is to tap into the nerves of people with ALS using electromyography, or EMG, sensors and create a device that can translate those nerve signals into operational commands. In practice, it would look like this: People with ALS wear wireless electrode pads on either their jaws, biceps, or thighs. The pads, which are equipped with small sensors, signal a device that is widely compatible with assistive and other technology. The new equipment -- wireless and wearable -- enables people with ALS to control an array of things, such as a computer, a phone, or a wheelchair. The most well-known communication technology for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, is eye gaze. The reality is that less than 10% of people with ALS use it. Our goal is to help every person with neuromuscular conditions have access to affordable, effective, and efficient communication.

BTP-114 has an approved Investigational New Drug (IND) application from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is positioned to enter the clinic to begin its Phase I clinical study. Placon has demonstrated in pre-clinical studies that, once administered, BTP-114 rapidly conjugates to serum albumin in blood through strong covalent bonds, resulting in a substantially increased plasma exposure, long circulating half-life and increased up-take by cancer cells with certain molecular profiles. A 13-fold increase in platinum in tumors is observed following dosing of BTP-114, resulting in improved efficacy in preclinical models of lung and ovarian cancer compared to cisplatin, while also reducing key dose limiting toxicities of cisplatin.",,"MIT faculty as founder | Stephen Lippard, MIT Professor of Chemistry","Cambridge, MA, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02139 • bd@placontx.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Feb 1, 2016",1-9,Healthcare,Health Care,NULL,,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/4235,2025-08-22T17:32:17
"PODIMETRICS, INC. Edit",http://www.podimetrics.com/,Podimetrics seeks to reduce the impact of diabetic foot ulcers through early detection and prevention.,"Podimetrics is a home healthdevice that aims to free the world from diabetic wounds, a condition leading to 100k unnecessary leg amputations each year in the U.S. alone. Of the 26 million diabetics in the U.S., more than a million will develop foot ulcers each year due to reduced feeling from peripheral neuropathy. Many of these patients will acquire intractable infections and 92,000 will ultimately require amputations. Aside from the terrible human price, ulcer treatment and foot amputation cost the U.S. healthcare system $71 billion annually. Today, ulcers are generally handled through foot examinations during monthly visits with diabetes specialists. While these visits provide a baseline level of protection, they miss the vast majority of developing ulcers. The big opportunity is to catch ulcers as they are forming – when it’s still possible to prevent them from manifesting -- and ideally with minimal effort required by patients and providers. Podimetrics provides an early warning system that detects and prevents diabetic foot ulcers. Podimetrics relies on a decades-old discovery: Wounds heat up before they break down. Foot ulcers take weeks to develop, usually from the force of walking or friction from shoes. When ulcers begin to form, the tissue breaks down, causing inflammation, leading to minute spikes in temperature. The startup is scaling up and aiming to get into many more homes in the coming year. It’s also starting a new set of studies to measure the cost and health outcomes associated with the mat.",Please add,"MIT alumni as founder | Jon Bloom, MD, CEO (MIT Sloan on leave of absence), David Linders, MS, MBA, CTO (Graduate of MIT LGO dual degree program), Brian Petersen, MS, MBA (Graduate of MIT LGO dual degree program).","49 Day Street, Suite A, Somerville, MA, 02144 • founders@podimetrics.com, jon@podimetrics.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Oct 22, 2011",1-9,Healthcare,Health Care,,,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/2762,2025-08-22T17:32:53

POLYGENCE Edit,https://www.polygence.org/,"Polygence is an online research academy dedicated to democratizing access to research opportunities for high school students. Polygence pairs curious students with expert mentors to pursue tailor-made research projects. Under the guidance of their mentors, Polygence students engage in academic fields across the humanities, fine arts and STEM.","Established in the fall of 2010 in Cambridge, MA, NuVu is an award winning full-time innovation studio for high school students. NuVu’s pedagogy is based on the architectural studio model and geared around multi-disciplinary, collaborative projects. NuVu provides students the opportunity to work collaboratively with academic and professional experts (PhDs/alumni from MIT and Harvard as well as leading professionals) to solve real-world problems. NuVu nurtures creative problem solving, team collaboration across networks, oral and presentation skills, technological proficiency, systems thinking, adaptability, risk-taking and imagination; All critical for student success in the 21st century. NuVu’s pedagogy is informed by the architectural design Studio where a coach guides students in hands-on problem-solving to solve complex, comprehensive problems. The Studio model uses exercises to build skills and integrates students’ knowledge in a final project. Within each multidisciplinary Studio, students explore problems rigorously by focusing on one project for two weeks. A Studio Coach mentors students to develop their project through an iterative process over the course of the Studio. Students confront the small and large contexts within problems as they are exposed to complex, ‘messy’ situations. The NuVu Team continuously evaluates students through deskcrits and final reviews. Develop Real-World Solutions for the World -- Taught within the multidisciplinary framework of the design Studio rather than traditional subjects, NuVu students acquire a highly personalized understanding of the world and how they relate to it and can fully participate in it. They develop multiple solutions to problems and learn the importance of moving from one solution to the next, combining, exploring and thinking of the possibilities. They also learn how to change their perspective on an issue quickly. They learn that solutions depend on perspective, and only by understanding an issue from multiple perspectives can they fully explore the terrain of possibilities. Iterative Process, Constant Feedback -- The iterative process, or process of refining an idea, product or solution, in the design studio is intended to provide students with continual feedback from NuVu Coaches and Staff on performance as well as product. NuVu students also experience working in an intense, feedback-rich environment that provides them with information and support for continuous self-evaluation, reflection, and improvement. Learn in New Ways -- NuVu challenges students to learn in new ways: analytical thinkers are inspired to explore their creative selves, while creative students expand their capacity to think and learn analytically. NuVu capitalizes on the immense resources of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University to focus on hands-on problem solving, encourage an inventive culture, promote peer teaching and learning, and cultivate students’ curiosity. Portfolio-Based Assessment -- Instead of grading, NuVu uses a portfolio-based assessment. A portfolio serves as a compilation of student work done at NuVu over the course of the term, semester or full year and is meant to show the student's growth over time and development of key academic and life skills (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, communication, research, quantitative reasoning and analysis). Each NuVu student is provided with their own online profile on NuVu's online platform where they document and present their work. At frequent periods during the term, NuVu's team works with the student to assess how far the student has developed since the beginning of the term. The portfolio-based assessment helps make learning and assessment relevant to students' lives.","Online marketplace connecting academic mentors with high school students.

We will be r","To achieve ambitious energy transition goals demand production of 115GW of energy from offshore wind by 2030, it is imperative to cut the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) by a third. The scale of offshore wind platforms, however, significantly exceeds that of their onshore counterparts, leading to escalating costs. For instance, the average blade lengths of offshore wind turbines are more than twice as long as those onshore, often exceeding 100 meters. Coupled with complex dynamics of not just wind, but also ocean loading on offshore wind assets, we face unprecedented challenges in design, installation, operations and maintenance (O&M). The role of smart assets and field automation in mitigating O&M costs is pivotal. However, the journey towards a fully automated future requires continuous data from critical components. While condition monitoring for nacelle components like gearboxes and electric generators is relatively mature, key assets like blades, towers, foundations, mooring lines, and cables are seldom instrumented. The calendar-based inspection and maintenance of these assets pose serious challenges to their performance, integrity, reliability, life extension, and cost-effectiveness. For example, leading edge erosion on blades can lead to an annual energy production loss of approximately 5% in the initial years of wind turbine operation, potentially reaching 20-25% if left unattended. Blade cracks and debonding result in integrity loss, unforeseen repairs, production loss, and a shortened lifecycle. The absence of performance data contributes to sub-optimal designs of offshore wind foundations, leading to escalating costs and high material requirements adding GHG emissions. Current sensor technologies (motion, strain, fibre-optics) and non-destructive technologies (ultrasonic, electromagnetic, radiographic) demand constant power for data measurement and storage, necessitating extensive wiring or frequent battery replacement. Given the dynamics, size, and distance to power sources of structural components (blades, tower, foundations), the use of existing sensor or NDT solutions for long-term deployment involves high costs, frequent maintenance, and complex installation procedures thereby limiting their scaled deployments, and continued high cost of offshore wind O&M.","Predyct automates infrastructure condition monitoring and deliver AI-enabled insights for maintenance, resource planning, extended operations and early warning of failures.

NuVu’s pedagogy is based on the architectural studio model and geared around multi-disciplinary, collaborative projects. NuVu provides students the opportunity to work collaboratively with academic and professional experts (PhDs/alumni from MIT and Harvard as well as leading professionals) to solve real-world problems. NuVu nurtures creative problem solving, team collaboration across networks, oral and presentation skills, technological proficiency, systems thinking, adaptability, risk-taking and imagination; All critical for student success in the 21st century. NuVu’s pedagogy is informed by the architectural design Studio where a coach guides students in hands-on problem-solving to solve complex, comprehensive problems. The Studio model uses exercises to build skills and integrates students’ knowledge in a final project. Within each multidisciplinary Studio, students explore problems rigorously by focusing on one project for two weeks. A Studio Coach mentors students to develop their project through an iterative process over the course of the Studio. Students confront the small and large contexts within problems as they are exposed to complex, ‘messy’ situations. The NuVu Team continuously evaluates students through deskcrits and final reviews. Develop Real-World Solutions for the World -- Taught within the multidisciplinary framework of the design Studio rather than traditional subjects, NuVu students acquire a highly personalized understanding of the world and how they relate to it and can fully participate in it. They develop multiple solutions to problems and learn the importance of moving from one solution to the next, combining, exploring and thinking of the possibilities. They also learn how to change their perspective on an issue quickly. They learn that solutions depend on perspective, and only by understanding an issue from multiple perspectives can they fully explore the terrain of possibilities. Iterative Process, Constant Feedback -- The iterative process, or process of refining an idea, product or solution, in the design studio is intended to provide students with continual feedback from NuVu Coaches and Staff on performance as well as product. NuVu students also experience working in an intense, feedback-rich environment that provides them with information and support for continuous self-evaluation, reflection, and improvement. Learn in New Ways -- NuVu challenges students to learn in new ways: analytical thinkers are inspired to explore their creative selves, while creative students expand their capacity to think and learn analytically. NuVu capitalizes on the immense resources of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University to focus on hands-on problem solving, encourage an inventive culture, promote peer teaching and learning, and cultivate students’ curiosity. Portfolio-Based Assessment -- Instead of grading, NuVu uses a portfolio-based assessment. A portfolio serves as a compilation of student work done at NuVu over the course of the term, semester or full year and is meant to show the student's growth over time and development of key academic and life skills (creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, communication, research, quantitative reasoning and analysis). Each NuVu student is provided with their own online profile on NuVu's online platform where they document and present their work. At frequent periods during the term, NuVu's team works with the student to assess how far the student has developed since the beginning of the term. The portfolio-based assessment helps make learning and assessment relevant to students' lives.","The ProtectEd ballistic bookshelf is a simple, easy-to-use product that provides both a practical function as a bookshelf and a protective function as a barrier against attack.

"PURVALA BIOSCIENCE, INC. Edit",https://www.purvala.com/,"Pūrvala was founded in 2020 to develop and commercialize advanced biomimetic and biotechnology-based materials for the health and beauty markets. The company's core technologies are based on discoveries from the laboratory of company co-founder Dr. Bradley Olsen, Professor of Chemical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Prof. Olsen is one of the world's leading experts on biofunctional and bioinspired materials employing polymer chemistry and protein engineering. The company uses cutting edge biotechnology and chemistry techniques to make innovative and high-performance health and beauty products. Our products are based on insights into biological structures and comprised of proteins, lipids, and other naturally occurring compounds and are inherently non-toxic and environmentally friendly. Pūrvala's initial focus is our technology platform for natural, high-performance, sustainable hair products including hair repair, shaping, and coloring.","The brand is built upon the coexistence of dichotomies: everyday and fantasy, tradition and innovation, design and versatility -- creating an elevated experience that defies trade-offs. Senreve believes women are multifaceted and can have it all -- no compromise necessary. Senreve was born when, as rising female professionals, we found ourselves in search of the perfect luxury handbag. The company was seeking something that was beautiful and feminine, but also versatile enough to keep up with our everyday lives. However, Senreve discovered most designer bags didn’t fully consider all of these needs, so we decided to take matters into their own hands. With Senreve, women are now free to go about their day with ease, empowered to better live their busy, modern lifestyles. From phone and wallet to laptop and lipstick -- finally a beautiful bag that knows how to multitask. What Senreve has created is a seamless blend of elegant design, impeccable quality and innovative construction. The bags are sleek, structured and designed to carry your life in style. They're also lightweight, travel-friendly and just as appropriate for a business meeting as they are for happy hour or brunch. Bags are made from 100% genuine Italian leather with a pebbled finish. Each bag is expertly handcrafted to look and feel soft and supple, structured yet lightweight, and durable and water-resistant. We’ve also invested heavily in a top quality micro-suede lining that most other brands deem too expensive to use. For us, a top-quality product begins with exceptional ingredients. Craftsmen constructing SENREVE bags today have worked with top luxury brands for over 50 years. They employ a difficult inside-out technique that only a few factories in the world are able to do. Senreve believes combining this master craftsmanship with design and innovation sets SENREVE apart as the future of luxury.","Pūrvala’s technologies are based on high-performing bioinspired and biomimetic materials discovered in Prof. Olsen’s laboratory. Using advanced chemistry and biological tools, Prof. Olsen identifies highly-evolved and -functional natural compounds and elucidates the molecular structure that confers their high-performance characteristics. We then use the tools of chemistry and biotechnology to develop even more highly functional versions of these natural compounds. These new versions, however, retain the biocompatibility, lack of toxicity, and environmental friendliness of the naturally-occurring source materials. Pūrvala’s focus is a hair technology platform, initially for natural hair repair, shaping and coloring products. This technology is based on a custom-engineered protein that binds to keratin found in hair. When bioconjugated to a lipid, this patent-protected compound restores natural structure to damaged hair. We are also using this technology to produce a natural hair straightener and hair colorant using the natural pigment melanin as the coloring moiety.","MIT-licensed technology | MIT faculty as founder | MIT alumni as founder | Prof. Brad Olsen and Justin Paloni, who received his Ph.D in Brad's lab, are co-founders.

Our rack-mounted quantum memory system is the first quantum networking solution that can be directly scaled up","There is a critical gap in the quantum technology industry: the need for high-quality, scalable connectivity among quantum computers, sensors, and other devices. As quantum devices emerge, the ability to transmit quantum information securely and efficiently over long distances will become crucial for the widespread implementation of applications. Addressing this challenge is essential for realizing the promising potential of quantum technologies, including unprecedented computational power, superior communications security, and enhanced sensor accuracy. Qunett aims to address this need by developing scalable quantum networking hardware that integrates with existing infrastructure to enable the transmission of quantum information between linked devices. Our mission is to pioneer the development of the world’s first scalable and deployable quantum network, ushering in a new era for the global information grid. This vision begins with the interconnection of quantum computers, essential for tackling complex problems requiring more than a million qubits. With known engineering roadblocks to scaling up single quantum processors, it will be necessary to connect multiple QPUs and form quantum data centers, mirroring the approach used to build classical supercomputers. We plan to expand quantum networking capabilities to metropolitan-scale fiber optic networks, aiming to extend connectivity to even greater distances through satellite links. These networks will be able to connect various quantum devices, facilitating secure communication, enhancing precision measurements, and enabling navigation systems beyond traditional GPS.","The two core challenges of building scalable quantum networks are sufficiently long storage of quantum states in memory and efficient distribution of high-fidelity entanglement. Qunett’s technology distinguishes itself with two strategies for overcoming these challenges. First, we utilize high-density, solid-state quantum memories based on fabricated diamond chips. By leveraging state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing techniques, we can densely pack small-footprint qubits, enabling the individual addressing of millions of qubits within a compact memory chip. Second, our approach to an entanglement source ensures the creation of entangled photon pairs using a method called zero-added-loss multiplexing. By generating many pairs of photons simultaneously and using the full spectral bandwidth without any added losses, we can achieve efficient entanglement generation and high transmission rates. With our hardware, we aim to enable efficient and scalable quantum networks, unlocking the full potential of quantum technologies and accelerating their timeline to practical applications.","MIT-licensed technology | MIT faculty as founder | Prof. Dirk Englund, Co-Founder","8 Saint Mary's Street, Room 621F, Boston, MA, 02215 • info@qunett.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Feb 1, 2022",1-9,Innovations,Technology,Under $2M,Quantum,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/35043,2025-08-22T21:45:40

REALTIME ROBOTICS Edit,http://www.rtr.ai,"Realtime Robotics expands the potential of automation. Its RapidPlan software generates collision-free motion plans in milliseconds for industrial robots. Its solution empowers robots to function together in unstructured and collaborative workspaces, as well as to react to dynamic obstacles the instant changes are perceived. Its solutions expand the potential of automation.","Realtime Robotics was founded to transform automation with flexible robot control capabilities, built on its innovative, real-time collision-free motion planning technology. Realtime’s products enable single or multiple robots to operate autonomously at full speed in unstructured and uncaged environments. With Realtime, industrial robots can be deployed, updated and/or re-deployed with minimal programming. Its technology empowers companies to automate more processes by removing engineering complexity and reducing cycle time, lowering overall expenses, increasing throughput, driving greater operational efficiency and significantly improving ROI.","Realtime Robotics RapidPlan software autonomously creates and choreographs all robot movements and removes the need for brand-specific robot programming. Within the software environment, users simply click on robots and target points to visualize task plans, saving weeks to months of programming time per project. The same software provides the simulation environment and controls real robots. Cell modeling, task planning, programming and operations are all handled within the same workflow tool. The motions in simulation and as-built reality match, dramatically speeding up the design and deployment processes. With any changes, such as geometry or robot locations, automated robot paths remain collision-free, giving manufacturers highly-flexible, multipurpose workcells. RapidPlan adapts to changing environments, either using the information from PLCs (programmable logic controllers) or from dedicated 3D sensors. For example, bin picking has traditionally been a challenging application for a multi-robot setup. Users don’t know the exact part location for picking, making it challenging to predict an accurate collision-free path for multiple robots that are completing tasks in the same area. With RapidPlan, robot space reservations are released in real time as soon as the robot moves to another location, dramatically improving cycle time or other parameters that users prioritize. During the on-site physical validation stage, a manufacturer typically needs to have a highly-skilled team working after hours to manually run through every move combination, ensuring seamless operations on the live factory floor. Because RapidPlan inherently produces collision-free paths, it reduces the need to verify against potential collisions - resulting in significant time savings. RapidPlan helps manufacturers have peace of mind in a high-stress and tight space environment, where every minute of downtime is expensive. It is easy to make a mistake, such as grabbing the wrong teach pendant and jogging the robot in the wrong direction, causing a collision. RapidPlan will alert the user of any potential collision beforehand, so steps can be taken to prevent it. If a cycle is interrupted for any reason, the user can easily and quickly return the robots to their home poses without needing to individually jog them home.","MIT alumni as founder | Peter Howard, SM Management 1984, CEO George Konidaris, Postdoctoral Researcher 2011 - 2014","27 Wormwood Street, Suite 110, Boston, MA, 02210 • gdk@rtr.ai, peter@rtr.ai, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Mar 11, 2016",50-99,Advanced Manufacturing,Manufacturing,$20-100M,,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/3387,2025-08-22T21:52:13

Today, about 30% of such items have compositions that don’t match their labels, and a significant fraction are contaminated by compounds with adverse health consequences. High-value items such as packaged medicines are also highly prone to fraud. Our company is developing innovative chemometric authentication devices based on nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy that have the potential to significantly mitigate contamination and fraud of consumables in the modern supply chain.","Trust is becoming an increasingly important factor in the lifecycle of consumables, from medicine to dietary supplements and diverse food products. According to World Health Organization (WHO), one out of 10 medicines in developing countries are falsified. There is also an epidemic of synthetic opioids being transported through the international mail system. There is a critical need to develop low-cost, reliable and non-invasive authentication method for consumables. We have designed a novel, reliable, and effective authentication method for consumables by sensing their unique chemical signatures using nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy.","Our approach allows a product or package to be authenticated at any stage of the supply chain using a portable NQR spectrometer and a computing device (e.g. a smart phone) that runs a customized application. A manufacturer needs to store the NQR signatures of the ingredients being used for product authentication in a cloud server (preferably in encrypted form to avoid data theft) before forwarding the product to later stages in the supply chain. The cloud server can be used to protect and control the access of tag information from unauthorized users. It can also be used for defending against common attacks like eavesdropping and man-in-the- middle attacks. This integrity verification step can either be used to authenticate the package and/or to trace it back to a manufacturer. As the NQR signatures are extremely hard to duplicate, the ingredients under test (known as chemical tags) can be used to check for different integrity issues, e.g., adulteration, mislabeling, and contamination. In case of authentication failure at any stage, the product can be brought to the attention of the manufacturer and/or regulatory authorities and appropriate measures can be taken.","MIT alumni as founder | Resonance Signatures was co-founded by Dr. Soumyajit Mandal, who is an MIT alumnus (M.S. 2004, Ph.D. 2009, Course 6).","2649 NW 136th Terrace, Gainesville, FL, 32606 • soumya@alum.mit.edu, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Feb 1, 2022",1-9,Hardware/Software Combos & Devices,Technology,Under $2M,"Materials authentication, verification, product integrity and safety, NQR spectroscopy",https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/38911,2025-08-22T21:59:52

ROUTABLE AI Edit,,"Routable AI is an early stage start-up from Boston spun out of MIT. Through 4 years of Mathematics and Computer Science research, we have built an advanced technology to route shared cars and shuttles on-demand with high efficiency and convenience for the rider. We enable the next generation of applications like UberPool and ViaVan. This time without the massive increase in travel time for riders, the unfair pay for the drivers, and the resulting congestions in cities. Our technology not only applies to cars with a capacity for 3 passengers, but also for larger capacity vehicles such as shuttles and buses (shared by around 12 passengers simultaneously). Think of this as push a button, get a shuttle. And it works extremely well. In a study, we showed that by using our technology we could serve all of the approximately 0.5M daily taxi rides in NYC with 80% less vehicles, while guaranteeing a high level of passenger convenience. Over the past year we have gained the attention of high level former Uber executives. Some of them have joined Routable AI with the mission to get ride-sharing right this time around. We are planning to deliver on the original promise of ride-sharing, which is to provide an alternative to a private car, alleviate congestion in cities, and to provide passengers with an affordable ride that is more convenient than public transit.","Accion is developing advanced technologies for the new space industry.

RRTC Edit,http://www.rrtc-tech.com,"RRTC has a low-temperature process to fabricate polymer-ceramic composite (PCCs). RRTC composites are a carbon-negative, lightweight, high-performance alternative to conventional carbon-positive materials such as wood, metals, ceramics, polymers, and fiber-reinforced resins. PCCs are manufactured in one step using RRTC's patented net-[size+shape] process at a cost far less than any commercial advanced composite material. RRTC is interested in meeting strategic partners interested in transitioning their businesses to carbon-neutral, sustainable materials that outperform their incumbent ones. RRTC also wants to meet investors interested in a cleantech venture whose products are profitable with or without 45Q.","Polymer-ceramic composites are limited in structure and chemistry by the processes used to bond them together. In order to form a continuous polycrystalline ceramic network, ceramics require high processing temperatures (>1000˚C). Unfortunately, polymers decompose at temperatures of 400˚C or lower. This temperature disparity prevents ceramic and polymer networks from being co-processed in a single step. Instead, time-consuming multi-step processes are required lasting days and even months. The raw materials are typically costly and difficult to obtain in large quantities, limiting these materials to low volume, value-added applications instead of having utility for the mainstream materials market.","RRTC uses a patented process called Low-Temperature Solidification (LTS) to manufacture polymer-ceramic composites. LTS creates the ceramic bond at temperatures less than or equal to those required to process polymers, enabling a broad range of polymer-ceramic compositions and novel materials properties. Aqueous solutions infiltrate and react with porous particulate ceramic networks, producing a continuous network that fills the pore space. This process creates small and large shapes of varying complexity without dimensional shrinkage. Simultaneously, polymer particles are co-processed to form a co-continuous network.","MIT alumni as founder | MIT, Ph.D., 1987, DMSE (Course III)","riman@rrtc-tech.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Feb 10, 2010",1-9,Advanced Manufacturing,Materials,$2-10M,"Polymer-ceramic composites, Materials, cleantech, Greentech, Carbon-negative, CO2, CCUS, carbon capture, utilization, and storage",https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/34596,2025-08-22T22:07:23

Saathi is empowering rural women to improve their lives and communities through low-cost, locally manufactured sanitary pads.","Saathi is empowering rural women to improve their lives and communities through low-cost, locally manufactured sanitary pads. THE PROBLEM -- A silent malady is crippling over 200 million women living in rural India. These women, aged between 12 and 47, are precluded from freely engaging in and contributing to their communities simply because they lack access to affordable sanitary protection. The implications are real – every year, many of these rural girls and women miss up to 50 days of work or school. Many school age girls either fall behind or drop out of school entirely. Along with economic challenges, cultural stigmas prevent many women from easily accessing safe sanitary protection, especially in the most rural Indian communities. More alarmingly, many of these women resort to using less hygienic alternatives such as rags to meet their need for sanitary protection, risking infection. Rudimentary forms of sanitary protection can lead to serious infections. This problem is not limited to India but is global problem that affects women in many parts of the world. The three main barries to rural women using pads are: (*) Affordability: Current sanitary pads in the market are not affordable. (*) Availabilty: Multinations do not have viable distribution channels in rural parts of the world. (*) Awareness: Many rural women are uneducated about the benefits of proper feminine hygiene practices. THE SAATHI SOLUTION -- In order to address this pressing healthcare issue, Saathi has developed a small scale manufacturing process to produce affordable sanitary protection from waste banana tree fiber. These pads will be manufactured and sold by local women. Saathi works with rural women to sell the pads door-to-door, in order to provide customers with in-person health education opportunities. Saathi's major innovation lies in the development of its small scale, modular manufacturing solution. The Saathi machine, which is actually an integrated chain of individual modules working together, takes inputs of the absorbent fiber pulp, spun-bonded polypropylene and hygienic-grade polyethylene and outputs a folded, sterilized sanitary pad complete with wings and adhesives for undergarment attachments.",,"MIT alumni as founder | CEO - Kristin P Kagetsu (kagetsu@alum.mit.edu), S.B., Mechanical Engineering.

The team’s impressive academic credentials include 10 PhDs and 18 Masters’ degrees. Indigo has matured several motor, battery, and wireless charging technologies and emerged from stealth in 2019 to bring these advances to market. Indigo has coupled all these technologies into several road-ready electric vehicle concepts used for testing, validation, and demonstration.

Well equipped facilities allow the team to move concepts from design to prototype quickly.","SafeMode's revolutionary technology allows drivers to be rewarded based on their personal improvement and efficiency. This is adjustable based on the fleet's goals and can combine several parameters such as safety, efficiency, texting, fatigue, and more. SafeMode's technology combines state-of-the-art AI with proprietary Behavioral Economics models, which profiles drivers for accurate assessment of the most effective feedback, personalized incentives, and positive user interaction and engagement. Smart incentive algorithms determine the optimal cost-effective monetary and non-monetary incentives for a given driver at any given time. Rewarding is not a new concept; fleet managers make use of scorecards and bonuses to reward drivers. However, without understanding how to incentive in the right way, they are wasting money with no result or even worse, they are incentivizing the wrong behavior instead of the right ones. The premise behind the technology is that what does not get measured does not get managed, and what does not get incentivized does not get achieved. With no need for hardware, the implementation is seamless and user-friendly for drivers and fleet managers alike. The platform aggregates multi-source data from existing devices in the vehicles to create a comprehensive context of the trip, including normalizing routes, weather, and traffic, which increase the driver's trustworthiness in the system.","MIT alumni as founder | Dr. Erez Shmueli, SafeMode's Chief Scientist and Co-founder is an MIT postdoc alumni.","655 Montgomery st. 7th floor, San Francisco, CA, 94111 • ido@safemode.co, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Jan 3, 2017",10-24,Intelligent Mobility,Transportation,Under $2M,"automotive, driver behavior, driver monitoring, fleet management, AI, Artificial Intelligence, Behavioral, Behavioral economics, driver engagement, user engagement, driver management, Transportation, fleet, connected cars, autonomous driving",https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/22568,2025-08-22T22:09:11

SESAME SUSTAINABILITY Edit,https://www.sesamesustainability.com,"Sesame Sustainability provides a software solution to accelerate the planning and verification of industrial decarbonization. We address key pain points (time, knowledge, and resource limitations) in assessing the costs and emissions of low-carbon technologies and supply chain decisions. Current planning and reporting solutions fail to address these complexities of heavy industry, despite it emitting nearly one quarter of global greenhouse gases.","Sesame is a simulation, optimization, and analysis software suite to democratize and accelerate the planning and verification of industrial decarbonization efforts. Our technology combines plant-level information with our databases and flexible first-principles models to capture all relevant technical, economic, and regulatory (e.g. the Inflation Reduction Act) aspects that make vetting emerging technologies (e.g. hydrogen, electrification, carbon capture) and portfolio investment and operating strategies so complex. Sesame will enable rapid analysis and serve as a single source of truth across large enterprises and multi-scenario analyses. Industrial and transportation sectors today emit ~46% of global GHGs. While institutional pressures mount, leaders in these companies struggle to plan for and enact deep decarbonization. This is because (1) vetting new industrial technologies (electrolytic hydrogen, novel CCUS, electrification, etc.) is very complex and time intensive (not to mention the significant capital outlays at stake) and (2) incumbent planning and operating solutions lack the technical depth and nuance required of these industries. Hence, in conducting these analyses, key pain points include teams’ time, knowledge, and resource limitations in assessing the costs and emissions of strategic low-carbon technology investments, all of which slow global emissions reduction. With Sesame, we address these challenges via packaging the requisite interdisciplinary expertise and complex modeling capabilities into an accessible, easy-to-use interface. For instance, a chemical manufacturer can easily import and configure plant process data and parameters (boiler information, flow rates, footprint, etc.) to enable quick “plug-and-play” cost and emissions comparison of very different decarbonization options (e.g. hydrogen-natural gas blending for boilers vs. stacking point-source carbon capture onto existing units) all within Sesame.","Sesame’s innovation and competitive advantage in the process modeling and decarbonization planning space is three-fold: (1) A flexible, layered software architecture that empowers users to simulate, optimize, and assess highly complex/unique system and supply chain configurations in minutes.

Such a design blocks analysts from getting started quickly, makes it tedious to optimize dashboards in custom BI engines with limited data processing capabilities, puts the onus of creating complex data models on highly scarce data engineers, and makes the data platforms completely unaware (and unoptimized) for the BI app running on top.

As a result, there is currently no way to fan-out these in-space data backbones to reach the expanding satellite market, further taxing the limited RF downlink resources that currently exist. Moreover, once the chosen data is finally streamed to terrestrial servers, industries on Earth and satellite operators in space struggle with making space-derived data accessible for broad industry use. Satellite earth observation data is often in the form of large and complex datasets, which can be difficult for non-experts to work with. Additionally, accessing this data can be expensive, limiting the number of potential users who can benefit from it, especially those who work in developing countries or fields with limited budgets that do not have aerospace expertise.","SpaceRake is developing a patent-pending orbital optical communication ""Router.""

"T-OMEGA WIND, INC. Edit",https://t-omegawind.com/,"T-Omega Wind is radically redesigning offshore wind turbines, from the water - up. Most offshore wind turbines adopt land-based structures, incurring huge manufacturing and maintenance costs. T-Omega Wind takes advantage of being on the water, rather than fighting it. Recognizing that weight drives cost and manufacturability, we designed a floating platform that is significantly lighter than standard designs. Our turbines can be deployed at depths of 20 meters to 2,500+ meters. Our goal is to democratize floating offshore wind.","Both onshore & offshore wind turbines have become increasingly large over the last 40 years, and all share the same design - a single steel pole (monopole), generator within a fixed nacelle, and 3 blades. This monopole design introduces tremendous challenges for ocean deployment. Fixed bottom monopole turbines can be deployed at a maximum depth of 60 meters, which severely constrains the ocean wind resource areas where they can be installed. Turbines are constructed at increasingly giant sizes, to reach economies of scale and to resist wave motion. These turbines have incredibly complex operations/maintenance costs - often requiring $2 million per week to service offshore. The entire ecosystem is impacted by these cost challenges: wind OEM's, wind project developers, marine cabling companies, marine operations/maintenance providers, electric utilities, and legacy energy companies.","Our T-Omega Wind (TOW) turbine has been designed from the water up, to be lighter, less costly & more manufacturable platform, which is easier to launch, install and service. The upshot is cheaper electricity in more locations, accompanied by many local jobs and fewer bottlenecks. (Our technology involves shallower floats and a motion tolerant hub – both solutions that have been overlooked by today’s industry.) We can compete anywhere that you find fixed bottom offshore turbines today, and we can also go everywhere else. We will remain an OEM, and sell our turbine to wind farm developers & electric utilities globally. A single 10MW turbine from TOW will power 5,000 homes (at 50% capacity factor). But the groundbreaking TOW platform also opens up an opportunity far more vast – the production of green fuel in the form of liquid hydrogen and liquid ammonia. Green fuel development is focused upon addressing needs for energy storage, global energy distribution, energy where renewables are poor, and energy for non-electric sectors (heavy shipping, aviation, industrial manufacturing, etc.)","MIT alumni as founder | Our co-Founder and Chief Engineer, Jim Papadopoulos, received both his SB (Mech.

Our process enables rural communities to become self-sufficient for their critical chemical commodities, rather than relying o","Most crop and forest residues (biomass) are loose, wet, and bulky, making them difficult and expensive to collect and transport to a centralized place where they can be converted into useful products. As such, many rural, underserved communities are often shut out from the benefits of the nascent bioeconomy, and their only recourse is to burn their residues in open air. Not only does this create a $120 billion/year economic loss, but the practice also contributes to severe air pollution and elevated risks of catastrophic wildfires. While biomass holds promise as a feedstock for a variety of purposes such as renewable energy, chemicals (e.g. hydrocarbon) synthesis, filter materials, and fertilizer, traditionally it is difficult to handle because it is often present in small pockets in remote places. Transporting wet, loose, and bulky biomass over long distances is very costly, and when not consumed immediately, raw biomass tends to rapidly degrade. In the world, about 4 billion tons/year of biomass residues are burned or disposed of rather than utilized, representing a ~$120 billion/year total market potential, as well as a burden of up to 18% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions.","Takachar is working on small-scale, low-cost, portable systems that can be latched onto the back of tractors or shipping containers and be carried from farm to farm to locally densify and upgrade the small pockets of residues in a way that does not require external energy input. This can cut down the subsequent transportation and processing costs of biomass by up to 70%. We envision that with our work, an additional $17 billion/year of biomass can be brought to the market at cost parity compared to the status quo as affordable source of energy or other products for rural communities. By adjusting the reaction condition, we can control our process to produce densified solid output that can be processed into various types of biofuels, fertilizer, and chemicals. At scale, we can remove more than one gigaton/year of CO2-equivalent, and avoid more than two gigatons/year of CO2-equivalent.

THE JESSARA GROUP Edit,http://jessaragroup.com/,"With the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) or drones for tasks such as package delivery, monitoring and surveillance, and information relay, automated deployment and operation have become essential. The success of this multi-billion dollar industry is heavily reliant on the drones being able to complete tasks without human interference or monitoring. Unfortunately, wear and tear, environmental conditions and accidental impacts limit the ability of the drones to perform as intended","De-Ice has a scalable platform technology that will first be launched in the aerospace industry. The beachhead market within this segment is comprised of air charterer companies in the United States. This market is a $400 million market and was selected based on the relatively lighter regulation, the emphasis placed on avoiding delays, and the flexibility of company budgets and purchasing decisions. The first follow-on market is commercial airliners, a $2.6 billion segment. Next, we plan to move on to European ($1.6 billion) and Asian ($1.3 billion) commercial airline markets. Finally, we will tackle other verticals including wind turbines, cars, and driveways. Every year, the airline industry devotes billions of dollars and considerable manpower to de-ice airplanes. To make matters worse, they employ a slow and harmful chemical treatment. De-Ice has created a novel technology that uses electric systems in lieu of these harmful chemicals. Our product will be manufactured directly onto airplanes, completely eliminating chemicals from the de-icing process. Additionally, our method entirely eliminates the manual labor associated with the process, and removes the ice in a fraction of the time and cost. The target business model consists of a one-time up-front installation fee, for retrofitting airplanes with our de-icing system. We will be responsible for developing and maintaining the technology, however we will outsource the actual manufacturing to a specialized third party. The beachhead market for our technology is comprised of U.S.-based private charterer companies which operate via a fractional ownership model, (i.e., individuals can purchase “time shares” in private jets from private charterer companies which own the jets). This market is a $400 million market and was selected based on the relatively lighter regulation, the emphasis placed on avoiding delays, and the flexibility of company budgets and purchasing decisions. The first follow-on market is U.S. corporate fleets ($120 million) where companies such as Microsoft own their own private jets. Finally, we will target U.S. commercial airliners, a $6.8 billion market.","The Jessara Group’s technology is based on a sensor suite comprising several inertial, vibration, environmental, and other sensors. The output from the sensors serves to calibrate our fast-solving reduced-order finite element based digital-twin. Furthermore, our interpretable machine learning algorithms are able to simulate damage states of the drone and teach a classification system to identify and quantify the damage and operational capability of a drone. This allows mission controllers to automate task allocation to drones based on their capability. For instance, a drone might be tasked for a long-range package delivery in uncertain weather but has been classified as being inefficient and structurally fragile. It can therefore be tasked to take on a shorter, smoother mission while a healthier drone is re-tasked to complete the more strenuous mission. Furthermore, maintenance and repairs can be scheduled based on the predicted capabilities of each individual drone.",MIT alumni as founder | Founder is an MIT Alum Jacob V Pretorius - S.M. 2004 MIT Sloan School of Management (Major: System Design & Management - Distance Learning) - gogga@alum.mit.edu,"No Street Listed, Austin, TX, 73301 • jaco@jessaragroup.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Jan 29, 2020",,Aerospace,Aerospace & Defense,Under $2M,"sensors, structures, digital-twin, classifiers, reduced-order models",https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/24142,2025-08-22T22:58:34

The lead drug candidate, TNAX101A (IMB1001), which is a humanized anti-DNAM-1 (aka CD226) monoclonal antibody. TNAX101A neutralizes interaction between DNAM-1 and its ligand, CD155, and suppresses inflammation. DNAM-1 is an activating immunoreceptor expressed on both adaptive and innate immunocytes. Expression of DNAM-1 and CD155 is negligible in healthy tissues. In inflammed tissues, however, the expression of both DNAM-1 and CD155 is significantly upregulated, and the binding of DNAM-1 and CD155 causes severe inflammation. Upon binding to CD155, DNAM-1 mediates an activating signal for cytokine production and/or cytotoxic activity in effector lymphocytes (T cells, NK cells, etc.). DNAM-1 is also expressed on the surface of regulatory T cells (Treg). TNAX101A suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines, activates Treg and potently reverses inflammatory conditions by targeting multiple immune responses. TNAX101A has a low risk of serious infections because it normalizes inflammation without excessive immunosuppression. TNAX101A is believed to be a novel treatment option for inflammatory bowel diseae patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate standard of care.

TOP GRAIN TECHNOLOGIES INC. Edit,http://topgrain.us,"Top Grain Technologies is commercializing a scalable high-throughput heat treatment solution that imparts a directionally solidified grain structure to additively manufactured (AM) Ni-base superalloys, enabling their use in the most demanding high-temperature applications, from gas turbines to rocket engines. The cutting-edge Top Grain heat treatment technology will enable more efficient, higher performing turbomachinery empowered by metal AM.","Metal additive manufacturing processes can create intricate components that are difficult to form with conventional processing methods; however, the as-printed materials often have fine grain structures that result in poor high-temperature creep properties, especially compared to directionally solidified materials. The Top Grain innovation is a specialized heat treatment which converts the fine as-printed grain structure to a coarse columnar one, with corresponding dramatic improvements in creep behavior. The Top Grain advantage offers other key capabilities, including the ability to create functionally graded grain structures which allows selective enhancement of fatigue or creep properties in different regions of the component through control of process parameters. Another capability is preservation of the preferred <100> texture produced during printing, which serves to minimize thermal stresses that arise in service. Currently, the Top Grain heat treatment is the only feasible method to enable AM components to serve in turbine hot section applications where creep resistance is a determining factor: turbine vanes and blades. Using AM to create these components enables breakthroughs in performance not possible through traditional methods, including higher operating temperatures and lower CO2 emissions made possible through more efficient cooling strategies and novel, high temperature materials, uniquely enabled by AM.","The Top Grain heat treatment works by converting the fine as-printed grain structure in additively manufactured materials to a coarse columnar structure, similar to that found in directionally solidified materials used in traditionally manufactured turbine components. This coarse columnar structure greatly enhances the high temperature performance of the AM material, opening up new opportunities for the advantages of AM. The Top Grain heat treatment also unlocks the potential of novel materials, such as additively manufactured oxide dispersion-strengthened superalloys, with creep resistance superior to that of cast single crystal components.",MIT-licensed technology | MIT faculty as founder | One of the co-founders and the chief scientific officer is Prof. Zachary Cordero from the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT.

Despite the advances in LiDAR to offset these shortcomings, visual imaging remains desirable for scenarios such as characterization of obstructions, optical character recognition, and quality control. Our technology overcomes these shortcomings. Ubicept leverages single photon perception. Single photon perception refers to utilizing individual, low-level photon data to achieve consistent and crisp imaging streams, particularly useful for computer vision applications.","For both human and machine vision, Ubicept enables perception in traditionally challenging imaging scenarios, including objects under fast motion with challenging lighting. Important specs include the following: - Fast Motion and Tracking: The zero read noise of the sensor is well-suited for burst-mode exposure for optical flow and image formation, practically eliminating motion blur while simultaneously reducing noise. - High-Dynamic Range: 150 dB+ as sensor technology improves - Operation in All Lighting Conditions: 0.01 lux to direct sunlight - Low Latency: The effective framerate of the camera is 100k fps, and Ubicept’s embedded processing approach can provide sparse feature tracking at 10 kHz. - Color: Color imaging is possible and will be demonstrated in FY23. - No cooling requirements at standard temperatures. - Size and Weight: Sensors are of a comparable size as conventional CMOS sensors, thus can be packaged with similar size and weight requirements. - Reduced Calibration: The same imaging optics can be used for passive fast motion optical imaging, passive slow-motion imaging, and (optional) active LiDAR. - Cost, Scalability, and Manufacturability: Sensors can be produced similarly to traditional silicon CMOS fabrication.

"VERDOX, INC. Edit",https://www.verdox.com/,"Verdox has found a new way of removing carbon dioxide from a stream of air could provide a significant tool in the battle against climate change. The new system can work on the gas at virtually any concentration level, even down to the roughly 400 parts per million currently found in the atmosphere.","Compared to other existing carbon capture technologies, the Verdox system is quite energy efficient, using about one gigajoule of energy per ton of carbon dioxide captured, consistently. Other existing methods have energy consumption which vary between 1 to 10 gigajoules per ton, depending on the inlet carbon dioxide concentration. The researchers have set up a company called Verdox to commercialize the process, and hope to develop a pilot-scale plant within the next few years.","Traditional carbon capture systems function like sponges for CO₂. When CO₂ comes in contact with the capture material, it is soaked up and trapped inside of the structure. The CO₂ is then squeezed out in the release process by applying large amounts of heat, which breaks the bonds between the CO₂ and the capture material. This process uses vast amounts of energy and is therefore difficult to scale. Verdox, in contrast, has designed an electric system that makes it easier to both soak up the CO₂ and squeeze it back out. The design of our capture devices allows for gases to flow through with less resistance, making the soaking process more efficient. Instead of squeezing out the CO₂ with heat, we also only apply a specific voltage to the capture material to release the CO₂. This radically different approach allows for far more efficient capture and release of CO₂ using only electricity, and without the need for heat or water.","MIT-licensed technology | MIT faculty as founder | MIT staff as founder | MIT student as founder | MIT alumni as founder | Founder/CTO Sahag Voskian received M.Sc., PhD from MIT ChemE.

"VERSEAU THERAPEUTICS, INC. Edit",https://www.verseautx.com/,"Verseau is advancing a new class of cancer immunotherapies to stimulate the conversion of immuno-suppressive and pro-tumorigenic M2 macrophages into pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages. This transformation, called macrophage repolarization, induces a coordinated immune response to fight cancer.","Verseau Therapeutics was founded in 2017 by Bob Langer, Dan Anderson, Tatiana Novobrantseva and Igor Feldman to discover and develop a broad pipeline of novel macrophage targets that stimulate their repolarization. Today’s T-cell based immunotherapies are able to provide benefit to ~10% of cancer patients.1 They are limited by the number of relevant tumor types and the number of patients achieving strong and durable responses in each approved indication. Turning up anti-tumor immune responses in the tumor microenvironment through macrophage repolarization could allow for effective treatment across more tumor indications, as well as a more potent effect in patients within a given indication. This is possible since tumor associated macrophages are present in the tumor microenvironment of >75% of patients with solid tumors, unlike T-cells which are found in ~25% of cancer patients. In addition, Verseau has demonstrated in head-to-head ex vivo studies with fresh human tumors that our lead macrophage repolarizing antibodies can be much more effective than PD-1 checkpoint blockade at stimulating the tumor microenvironment into a pro-inflammatory state. As a result, Verseau believes its innovative programs can expand the potential clinical benefits of immunotherapy to a large, underserved patient population. The convergence of our patient-based discovery engine along with traditional biology validation tools led Verseau to the discovery of over 20 new macrophage targets. Two of those targets were prioritized and are now our lead programs, each offering unique biological advantages, targeted to distinct tumor types that are enriched with patients who are more likely to respond favorably to treatment.","Verseau’s macrophage repolarization target discovery engine leverages human and disease biology, as well as computational approaches in a patient-focused discovery process. We are developing a robust pipeline of first-in-class monoclonal antibodies that bind to novel macrophage repolarization targets.

VISOLIS Edit,http://visolisbio.com/,Visolis is an industrial biotechnology company developing the next generation of biocatalysts that can convert renewable feedstocks into chemicals and fuels at a price point competitive with petroleum based processes.,"Visolis has created a bio-based process that leads to the production of net-zero high-performing SAF molecules. This is achieved through the co-production of bio-based isoprene, which is used to make synthetic rubber. This process is fundamentally different from competitors that attempt building high value chemicals and polymers from ethanol, CO2, or vegetable oils. Instead, Visolis produces the energy-dense molecule mevalonolactone (MVL) that can be chemically upgraded to fuels and polymer feedstocks using common unit operations. At present, the aviation industry is aggressively searching for low-carbon alternatives that could achieve the scale and cost required for a complete transition to SAF. Even among SAF producers, Visolis is distinguished by producing both the valuable cycloalkane and aromatic components of jet fuel. Visolis blend component it complementary to most producers’ who envision using Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) or Ethanol to Jet (ATJ) or Fischer-Tropschs (FT) processes leading to straight alkane components of jet fuels. In order to 100% replace petroleum-based jet fuel, any 100% SAF must contain 8-20% of aromatics and 10-20% of cycloalkanes to meet the standards of ASTM approved jet fuel. No current SAF production pathway offers the ability to produce both cycloalkanes and aromatics through one production process. Our process is also flexible and has the ability to co-produce the chemical isoprene, the precursor to synthetic rubber. Since isoprene is used in structural materials which harness the captured CO2, we are able to design our facility and process for the production of a net-zero or carbon-negative SAF molecule.","Visolis’ technology combines synthetic biology and traditional chemical catalysis to produce a portfolio of high-performance aviation fuels and bio-based polymers. Our technology allows for the use of a variety of sustainable raw materials, including waste biomass and CO2, to be transformed into these high-performing fuel molecules and polymers. Our innovative production process allows for the production of cycloalkane and aromatic SAF molecules that are complimentary to the current commercial molecules which are limited to a 50% blend limit. Through the addition of Visolis' SAF molecules, we can enable a 100% SAF solution.","MIT alumni as founder | CEO/CTO: Deepak Dugar, MS and PhD, Chemical Engineering Practice - dugar@visolisbio.com and 617-955-4626","1488 Zephyr Ave, Hayward, CA, 94544 • dugar@visolisbio.com, ppetersen@visolisbio.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Jun 1, 2012",10-24,Biotech,Biotechnology,$2-10M,,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/2819,2025-08-22T23:25:57

VITAKEY INC. Edit,https://vitakey.com/,"A targeted delivery platform to enhance the full spectrum of the food supply chain For decades, the food industry has struggled to adequately deliver nutrients, vitamins, probiotics, proteins and flavors due to losses during cooking or storage. All that is about to change. VitaKey’s targeted and time-controlled release customized solution is a transformative technology that improves the full spectrum of the food supply chain - from seeds and agriculture to aquaculture, animal feed, pet foo","Food insecurity is a huge problem in America.

Blockparty provides a unique experience, enjoying food and drink in the company of friends while working together to bring a recipe to life. Whether you’re an experienced chef or beginner, learn to cook (then eat!) new dishes with professional chefs. Instead of just cooking for yourself, you'll be cooking extra meals as well to be provided to food insecure individuals in your community. Giving back to your community has never been so fun (or tasty!).","Building on 46 years of experience and achievements in pharmaceutical delivery systems, Dr. Robert Langer, Institute Professor and director of the Langer Lab at MIT, co-founded VitaKey to advance the delivery systems for precision nutrition. VitaKey’s targeted and time-controlled release technology platform can deliver micronutrients, vitamins, probiotics, nutraceuticals, antioxidants, proteins, flavors, and aromas – enhancing food and beverages and facilitating better nutritional value. VitaKey offers a single technique suitable for preserving all micronutrients — in combination with other foods — throughout the process of storage, cooking and consumption. VitaKey employs a microparticle-based technology — developed by scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology — that coats micronutrients with a protective coating that preserves them from heat, moisture and chemical interaction. The pH-sensitive coating only becomes soluble in the acid environment of the stomach, releasing the intact micronutrients for digestion. A different pH-sensitive coating can be formulated to release flavors in the mouth or intestines. VitaKey technology also offers new possibilities for improving the bacterial environment of the human digestive tract — the microbiome. Of the trillions of bacteria present in the human digestive tract, many serve positive functions in the digestion of food and in suppressing harmful bacteria. Imbalances in the microbiome not only play a role in gastrointestinal ailments such as colitis and Crohn’s disease, but in diabetes, heart, disease and cancer. Over-the-counter probiotic supplements — recommended for intestinal health — are also susceptible to deterioration in storage and may be neutralized by stomach acid before they ever reach the intestine. VitaKey’s targeted and time-controlled release technology protects desirable microbes from the acids and bile salts of the stomach until they reach the intestine, where they adhere to the mucosal lining and propagate. VitaKey introduces a layer by layer technology that completely protects beneficial bacteria until they reach their intended destination. Paired layers of the biodegradable polysaccharides chitosan and alginate shield the probiotics from acids in the stomach and from bile salts in the intestine. The layer by layer coating adheres to the mucosal lining of the intestine for hours, allowing useful bacteria to propagate in the intestine. Further work with the layer by layer technology offers the possibility of still more precise targeting and delivery of probiotics to specific areas of the body.",MIT-licensed technology | MIT faculty as founder | Dr. Robert Langer and Dr. Ana Jaklenec are co-founders and on the Board of Directors for VitaKey.,"700 Main Street North, Cambridge, MA, 02139 • andrea@vitakey.com, info@vitakey.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Apr 15, 2020",10-24,Biotech,Food & Beverage,$2-10M,"Nutrition Science, Food, Bioavailability, Nutrients, Probiotics, Health",https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/26863,2025-08-22T23:27:14

Value-based health systems use our data to reduce total cost of care among some of their most vulnerable patients: walker users. WalkWise focuses on mobility aid adherence to reduce falls, which costs the healthcare system over $60B annually and is the leading cause of fatal injury for older adults. Numerous lives have been saved as a result of our “tip-over” notification feature. WalkWise is in-market, demonstrating fall reduction results of around 40% with early customers, and continuing to prove outcomes and grow revenue.","Falls among seniors cost the U.S. healthcare system over $60B, and people who use walkers tend to be at the highest risk of falling. An estimated $3,600 is spent annually on fall-related costs for people who use walkers, and falls are the leading cause of fatal injury for those over 65. Walkers prevent falls by enabling stability and allowing people to remain active and avoiding deconditioning. However, there is no tool available to caregivers and healthcare organizations to ensure adherence to this necessary medical equipment. What’s more, traditional wearable devices for activity tracking do not function for people using a mobility aid. Apart from falls, remote monitoring is an important part of the future of medicine. Early identification of health status changes or dangerous behavior has shown to be effective.

This is far from reality – common emergency neurosurgeries such as ventriculostomies are performed by surgeons ‘guessing’ where targets are in the brain, leading to over 50% misplacement rates. Simple cases that could be performed in 30 minutes, such as biopsies, require general anesthesia and clamps being screwed onto patient’s skulls, costing hospitals tens of thousands of dollars per case. Non-invasive cases, such as rTMS to treat drug-resistant depression, are performed with no guidance at all, despite studies showing that guidance can improve response rates by 2X. Our goal at Zeta was to build the ‘last’ guidance system for neurosurgery – one that can be used quickly, easily, and portably at the point-of-care, regardless of whether the patient is awake or asleep, in an emergency room or operating room, or at Stanford or a community hospital in the rural Midwest.

ZING DATA Edit,https://www.getzingdata.com/,"Using data to make decisions has long been constrained to data teams, engineers, and people who know SQL or other query languages. But Zing is making asking questions from mobile or desktop less than ten seconds, and collaborative. Like Google docs changed how we edit documents, or Figma revolutionized how we design, Zing is revolutionizing how we use data. Already trusted by hundreds of users, Zing is the modern, multiplayer way to bring data to everybody on your team.","We're solving the problem that querying, visualizing, and making decisions from data is expensive, time consuming, and single-player. It doesn't serve the 80% of world's workforce that is deskless, or the 4+ hours a day that traditional knowledge workers spend on their phone. Zing is simple, social business intelligence that works anywhere - on mobile, on desktop, and with your whole team.","Zing's all-MIT founding team automatically optimizes queries for faster runtime, re-imagined asking questions with a visual query editor, and built collaborative tools like @mentions and shared questions which allow anybody at a company to learn, express their curiosity, and make better decisions with data.","MIT alumni as founder | Both Cofounders are MIT alums, and we met @ MIT in grad school. https://www.linkedin.com/in/zackhendlin/ https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabinthomas/","No Street Listed, San Francisco, CA US, CA, 94109 • help@getzingdata.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Apr 5, 2021",1-9,Data/Analytics,Software,Under $2M,"Data Analysis, business intelligence, future of work, collaboration, Productivity, databases, querying, business analysis",https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/34648,2025-08-22T23:49:31
ZOLITRON TECHNOLOGY Edit,http://www.zolitron.de,Zolitron Technology designs and produces micro power supplies that charge themselves.,"As Zolitron Technology, the mission is to remove batteries from common, consumer devices. We want to replace batteries with circuitry that can store energy from the environment (e.g. solar, kinetic, heat) to provide devices with energy autonomy. Through this technology we would protect the environment by reducing the manufacture and consumption of batteries, promote safety for consumers by removing the need for laborious or ignored battery replacement, and provide a more enjoyable and convenient experience. As of yet, there has been few compelling examples of energy autonomy in our devices. These Energy Autonomous Devices will not only provide more safe and convenient products now, but enable new ubiquitous wireless devices for smart environments and the internet of things.",Please add,MIT alumni as founder | Tyler Hutchison is an MIT alumni : EECS BSc 2009 EECS MEng 2011,"Universitaet Strasse 150, Bochum, 44801 • azinn@zolitron.de, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu, thutchison@zolitron.de","Sep 1, 2015",1-9,Energy Tech,Electronics,,,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/4047,2025-08-22T23:50:21
ZORION MEDICAL Edit,http://www.zorionmedical.com/,Developing a fully absorbable medical device platform targeting treatment of coronary and peripheral artery disease,"Zorion Medical is developing a fully absorbable medical device platform targeting treatment of coronary and peripheral artery disease. Utilizing novel bio-materials, our unique design has the acute performance characteristics of bare metal and drug eluting stents with complete absorption following deployment. Established in 2010, the vision is to create a temporary device platform that will treat the vascular problem, deliver a drug if necessary, and go away as soon as the body has healed itself eliminating the challenges and potential complications associated with permanent implants. The ZMED device is a wire-form, magnesium-based alloy stent uniquely designed and engineered to deliver a drug and be absorbed within 6 to 12 months following deployment. The ZMED system is a low profile, balloon delivered device with advantages over first generation fully absorbable stents based exclusively on polymer technologies. The combined strength, flexibility, low profile, and design of the ZMED device enable performance characteristics for a wide range of potential clinical applications including small vessel and tortuous coronary and peripheral artery disease, AMI, long lesions, and dissections. Currently in pre-clinical development, the ZMED device has been tested in three animal studies to determine the strength, flexibility, and acute absorption profile of the device. All three studies were successfully completed and showed excellent results including little to no biological response associated with the bio-materials or performance of device. Planning is underway to finalize our next preclinical study that will determine the complete absorption profile of the device with and without drug. That study will begin in Q1, 2014. Based on these results, activities to begin final product optimization to initiate first-in-human studies will begin in early 2015.",Please add,"MIT alumni as founder | Co-Founder - David Broecker, SMS chemical engineering.","49 Boone Village#257, Zionville, IN, 46077 • dabroecker@aol.com, startupexchange-admin@mit.edu, startupexchange@mit.edu","Jan 1, 2010",1-9,Biotech,Biotechnology,,,https://startupexchange.mit.edu/node/3056,2025-08-22T23:50:57
