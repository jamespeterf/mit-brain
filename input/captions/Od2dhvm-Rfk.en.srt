1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:10,719
on a technical level of using the tool

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:14,000
of um the imaging tool uh we use it to

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,640
probe how synapses are formed. What

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,520
influences that? What influences the

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,480
fact that they are dismantled.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:28,320
Um so those are pretty basic uh

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,640
you know features of how brain cells

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:36,000
alter their connectivity

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:39,920
but uh you can apply once you understand

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,719
um how to visualize it and what the

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,800
baseline is of normal

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:51,120
um kind of brain plasticity is. You can

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:55,039
use any mouse model for any disease. Um,

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,399
and you can use that tool to ask what is

15
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,520
wrong in terms of

16
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,000
how synapses are formed and dismantled

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,280
in the disease model. And many diseases

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,280
do have a synaptic phenotype. In fact,

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,560
synap genes that encode synaptic

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,520
proteins are like a hot bed for

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:20,000
neurodeeneration mutations.

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:24,720
um uh mental health genetic uh

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,799
mutations. Uh so so it's a powerful tool

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,240
to kind of probe mechanism of what goes

25
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,600
wrong in these sorts of situations. So

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,680
that's one aspect. Um

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,560
the second aspect that uh we work on

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,520
relates to the genes or the synaptic

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,079
genes or proteins themselves.

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,240
And um

31
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,799
we know that one of the driving forces

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,280
for plasticity is basically activity.

33
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,240
Sort of like in the same way as like you

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,840
go to the gym and you work your muscles,

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,479
your muscles that you work become

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,119
strong. connections in your brain that

37
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,799
you use a lot become stronger. So it's

38
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,599
the use the activity of these

39
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,720
connections that is really

40
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,959
driving their strengthening.

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,200
So the and connections that don't get

42
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,360
used basically eventually dwindle away

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,400
and go away. So um

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,239
use or activity is driving the change.

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,879
And so these proteins that are synaptic

46
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,400
proteins that are sort of implementing

47
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,920
things um they're very often regulated

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,800
by levels of activity. And so a long

49
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,920
time ago we did a screen for genes that

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,440
actually respond to neural activity sort

51
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:53,200
of as a way to identify who might be

52
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:55,599
participating in these events. And uh

53
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,160
these genes have turned out to be

54
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,120
extremely interesting

55
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,440
um in terms of their synaptic functions.

56
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,840
And even though again we started looking

57
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,159
at it as a basic feature of how the

58
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,480
brain modifies connections, it turns out

59
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,959
that the two genes that we picked as our

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,440
first new discovered genes that are

61
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:20,560
activity regulated have both turned out

62
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:24,840
to be uh really important also from a um

63
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,840
sort of a disease perspective.
