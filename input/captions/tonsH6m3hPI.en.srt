1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,960
hi again welcome back to the crash

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,120
course in the autoimmune disease machine

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,240
learning challenge in this lecture we're

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,160
going to cover technology uh but before

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,120
that let's just briefly recap what you

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,800
learned in the first lecture so in the

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,840
first lecture we had an introduction to

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,960
autoimmune disease and we learned about

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,439
ulcerative colitis and how Pathologists

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,400
study uh ulcerative colitis tissues and

11
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,920
then we finally learned that patients

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,480
with ulcerative colitis have increased

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,320
risk for col cancer now one of the

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,640
things that these pathology images don't

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,680
really tell us is the mechanism of the

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,399
disease or how the disease might

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,640
progress what's the chance that a

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,760
patient might uh progress to cancer so

19
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,280
we need other Technologies to really get

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,199
at these questions and that's what the

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,879
focus of this lecture will be so

22
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:56,399
technology so we're going to really

23
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,559
focus on one aspect of the cell and the

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,960
tissue that we can measure which is gene

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,239
expression so first I'm going to review

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,240
with you what genes are and how gene

27
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,799
expression changes in health disease and

28
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,960
cancer and then I'll introduce to you

29
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,119
how we can measure gene expression in

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,439
tissues and in

31
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:19,400
cells so let's get started by uh talking

32
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,640
about genes so uh you know genes are the

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,600
basic unit of inheritance uh or heredity

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,159
uh they are inherited from our parents

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,119
uh and so we have them from our mom and

36
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:34,840
our dad uh genes are written in DNA

37
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,200
sequences using the bases a TC and G in

38
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,799
here is DNA and it forms this beautiful

39
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,600
double helix structure and so genes are

40
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,200
written in the DNA and this is used to

41
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,200
write out both physical and biological

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,960
traits so genes can encode things like

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,479
our height or our eye color but variance

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,600
in these genes can also increase or

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,360
decrease our risk for certain diseases

46
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,200
so we know there are certain variants in

47
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,200
genes that increase our risk for

48
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,560
ulcerative

49
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,840
colitis so uh you know genes as I said

50
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,920
are written in the DNA and then

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,599
information in the DNA or in the in the

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,440
genes flows from the DNA to the RNA to

53
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,879
the protein so DNA is sitting in the

54
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,200
nucleus of our cells and then it gets

55
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,000
copied or transcribed into an RNA

56
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,760
molecule and then that RNA molecule gets

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,040
translated into a protein and a protein

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,160
is a biomolecule that can carry out many

59
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,440
functions in cells and tissues it gives

60
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,239
cells structure it's important for

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,160
interactions between cells it's they're

62
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:40,120
doing almost everything uh they're

63
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,239
pretty amazing so let's take a look at

64
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,760
how this plays out in

65
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,840
tissues so here we're looking at four

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,040
different tissue types and each of them

67
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,879
is made up of different uh cells here we

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,560
have the skin the brain the small

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,159
intestine and blood uh there are two

70
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,000
really I think amazing things about

71
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,680
these images when you look at them one

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,319
is just the diversity so you know the

73
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,120
skin is protecting us from our outside

74
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,879
environment the brain is doing all our

75
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,440
thinking and memory hopefully you're

76
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:14,879
using it as you listen to me um the

77
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,760
small intestine is where our food is

78
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,840
traveling down and nutrients are getting

79
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,799
absorbed and finally we have blood

80
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,560
vessels where uh immune cells and red

81
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,319
blood cells carrying oxygen move

82
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,920
throughout the body so that's really

83
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,760
incredible all of this is happening in

84
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,360
our body there's huge diversity but

85
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,560
what's even more remarkable

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,840
is that each of these cells that make up

87
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,360
these tissues have essentially the exact

88
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,200
same DNA sequence so that's really

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,879
incredible so how does that work so

90
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,000
essentially what's going on is that

91
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,879
within every cell there's regulation of

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,159
which genes are being expressed so which

93
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,480
genes are being turned on or off so in

94
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:56,319
the human genome we have all of us

95
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,680
20,000 genes but they're not all on at

96
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,480
the same time there's specificity to

97
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,680
which cells they're on

98
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,920
so remember DNA is transcribed or copied

99
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,439
into RNA and this control of this is

100
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,000
what regulates which genes are on or off

101
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,680
in any given cell so let's look at a

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,320
cartoon of what's going on here so here

103
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,519
we have gene expression or genes and

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,880
then here we have different cell types

105
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,199
and red means that this Gene is

106
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,960
expressed in that cell type so within

107
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,039
the B cells we have a certain group of

108
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,759
genes being expressed or turned on

109
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,840
within T cell cells we have a different

110
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,639
set of genes being turned on or off and

111
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,880
then finally in the muscle cells we have

112
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,680
another set of genes that are turned on

113
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,039
and again there are 20,000 genes they're

114
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,720
not all on at once it's just subsets of

115
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:45,639
genes so these groups of genes that are

116
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,639
expressed together we often refer to

117
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,479
them as gene expression

118
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,720
programs and we can discover these gene

119
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,160
expression programs by taking cells and

120
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,000
measuring the expression of the genes

121
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,919
inside the cells so to do that we really

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,240
need to f focus on the RNA so when RNA

123
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,240
is made that means a gene is being

124
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,759
expressed and we call these RNA

125
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,160
molecules that are made transcripts or

126
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,680
Gene

127
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,759
transcripts so during disease there's a

128
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,479
big change in these gene expression

129
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:20,680
programs so these groups of genes that

130
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,080
are regulated together so here we're

131
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,319
returning to our cartoon of the colon

132
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,080
epithelial barrier and in healthy colon

133
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,280
there are many gene expression programs

134
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,759
that are turned on that serve to keep

135
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,520
the tissue in homeostasis so in this

136
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,840
healthy balance and some of these

137
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,000
programs are things that are genes that

138
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,160
are involved in nutrient absorption so

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,400
our gut is taking in nutrients from the

140
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,759
food that's being digested there's also

141
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,520
programs involved in microbe defense so

142
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,319
we don't want these microbes to really

143
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,319
be crossing over however in ulcerative

144
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,600
kitis as you start damaging the colon

145
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,680
epithelial barrier and microbes start

146
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,639
migrating into the colon you get gene

147
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,039
expression programs that are involved in

148
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,360
epithelial barrier dysfunction so these

149
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:06,520
cells are under a lot of stress as the

150
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,639
microbes make their way in you start to

151
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,120
see uh programs involved in microb

152
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,840
sensing so the cells are sensing hey

153
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,960
there's a bacteria here that doesn't

154
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,639
belong and then you also start to get

155
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,840
this early immune response with

156
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,840
inflammation that progresses to chronic

157
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,039
inflammation so again all of this is

158
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,080
controlled by gene expression

159
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:30,039
programs the same holds true in cancer

160
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,840
so as a healthy colon transitions over

161
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,360
to displasia into cancer you also get

162
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,080
these gene expression programs that are

163
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,759
turned on so remember cancer is sort of

164
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,199
one defining feature is this

165
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,120
uncontrolled growth so you see the

166
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,240
program for cell division being turned

167
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,400
on as the cancer grows and grows you

168
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,720
also see a program called epithelial to

169
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,080
meenal transition which is these

170
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,120
epithelial cells start to detach from

171
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,440
the tissue and migrate throughout the

172
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,560
body to another site and that's called

173
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,960
uh metastasis and that's really uh bad

174
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,440
for the patient requires a lot of

175
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,759
intervention

176
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,199
obviously so at this point we've

177
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,360
introduced two different ways to profile

178
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,639
uh tissues in humans one is tissue

179
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,599
pathology where we stain a piece of

180
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,400
tissue with this h& stain and the other

181
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:18,520
is measuring gene expression where we

182
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,560
are measuring the expression of all

183
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,919
20,000 genes inside a cell or inside a

184
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,360
tissue so let's compare and contrast

185
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,080
these two different approaches to

186
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,039
profiling tissues so with tissue

187
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,759
pathology uh a PA ologist can

188
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,639
immediately see after seeing the uh

189
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,919
tissue the spatial organization of the

190
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:36,960
tissue uh they can make a diagnosis

191
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,879
whether they think the patient has

192
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,960
alterative colitis they can make a

193
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:44,120
prediction as to how the disease might

194
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,599
progress potentially uh they can uh come

195
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,120
up with you know what's the treatment

196
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,120
strategy so these are all really

197
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,879
important things with patient care at

198
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,759
the same time uh these pathology images

199
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,440
there's many of them available across

200
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,319
hospitals in the world so there's

201
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,120
millions of these images likely and they

202
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,680
are cheap and routine to collect

203
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,080
on the downside um you know just looking

204
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:08,199
at these images alone uh they do not

205
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,159
tell us how the disease arises and they

206
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,720
do not tell us how the disease May

207
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:14,840
progress to cancer like what are the

208
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,800
pathways that could happen and because

209
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,879
of this we also don't know how to Target

210
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,360
these diseases or cancer with a drug

211
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,919
because we don't know the pathways and

212
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,720
we don't know what's going wrong so we

213
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,159
don't know what what to fix or where to

214
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,120
intervene and again this is probably

215
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:31,080
because in a sense these tissue images

216
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,000
are somewhat low information they're low

217
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,320
Dimension it's just three channels a red

218
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,800
green blue image so the gene expression

219
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,279
on the other hand is a high dimensional

220
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,680
measurement we're measuring 20,000 genes

221
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,399
and when we do that we can really look

222
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,160
at which genes are associated with

223
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,760
disease uh which pathways are being

224
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,080
turned on and this can give us an idea

225
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,480
of Pathways or parts of the cell to be

226
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,000
targeting with a drug so that's really

227
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,959
in uh just important for Discovery now

228
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,600
the downside of this is that gene

229
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,040
expression is actually technically quite

230
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,040
hard to measure and it takes a lot more

231
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,880
money and time uh and the Technologies

232
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,040
to do this are becoming really Advanced

233
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,279
and in this challenge or these crunches

234
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,200
we're going to be working with some of

235
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,839
the newest Technologies but also

236
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,839
conversely they're the most expensive

237
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,360
Technologies so the premise of this

238
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,079
autoimmune disease machine learning

239
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,079
challenge is what if you could combine

240
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:24,360
these two technologies and kind of get

241
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:26,200
the best of both worlds so can we train

242
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,720
machine learning models that will

243
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,839
connect the tissue pathology to the gene

244
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,360
expression and so now we're really

245
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,200
taking advantage of both Technologies

246
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,760
and then if we can train these models

247
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,680
that can take in tissue pathology and

248
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,399
tell us something about gene expression

249
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,560
can we apply such models to do a better

250
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,240
job at detecting cancer earlier in ulcer

251
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,839
colitis when a pathologist is studying

252
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,839
those tissue sections
