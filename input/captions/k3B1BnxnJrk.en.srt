Up next, please welcome Bevel Software.

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,559
Bevel Software, which is uses NAI

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,639
enhanced step-by-step reverse

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,799
engineering approach to help companies

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,799
quickly adapt to change with minimal

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,799
risk.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,640
>> Okay. Hello everyone. Um, let me try the

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,640
pager here.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,760
Oh.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,840
Spoilers.

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,840
[laughter]

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,680
All right. Hello everyone. So I'm the

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,840
founder of Bevel. I was a previous

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,360
researcher at CCI under Thomas Malone

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,040
where I started to see a little bit of

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,879
the challenges of deploying agents in

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,440
industrial settings. I'll talk to you

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,239
today about UTCP and how to integrate

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,520
LLMs and agents securely in your

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,360
organization. So before we get too much

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,600
in the crux of it um why is this

22
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,039
important especially at coms the next

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,760
phase of the engine is being defined and

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,440
it's going to be agentic in some way and

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,479
it's going to be a lot of connecting

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,320
capabilities and APIs to agents. The

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,840
question is what are agents? What is

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,320
tool calling? Well, LM agents are

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,400
autonomous LMS that make decisions under

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,159
complex environments and tool calling is

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,479
giving them these superpowers, these

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,479
capabilities, connecting them to the web

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,080
browser, connecting them to Gmail,

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,200
letting them be able to take decisions

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,520
and kind of act in those environments.

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,960
Now, what is the problem? Well, actually

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,159
deploying this, I don't know if anyone

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,640
has ever tried, but deploying the

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,400
deploying this securely in industry is

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,680
actually very very challenging. The

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
reason is because you have three

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,439
options. The first one is to do nothing

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
and wait for the technology to get

44
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,280
better, which happens. But if you don't

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,560
want to be left behind, what you can do

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,680
is also build custom API integrations to

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,439
every agent. And once you're dealing

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,200
with tens or dozens or hundreds of

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,640
agents and dealing with hundreds of

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,799
APIs, this becomes a very technic like a

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,399
very large engineering effort. The other

52
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,439
option is to use existing protocols such

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,080
as MCP that um Dr. Clark talked about

54
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,080
earlier um to connect your internal APIs

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,080
and your internal capabilities to your

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,440
LM agents. But the problem with that is

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,520
actually it's not secure. You're adding

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,760
a new calling layer that is not battle

59
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,319
tested, that is not used before and

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,000
increasing the attack surface. So kind

61
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,599
of to summarize this, you could rebuild

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,680
all the tool integrations to your

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,480
agents. You could use existing protocols

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,400
and and improve the increase the attack

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,239
surfaces and and the security risk. But

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,480
what if there was a fourth option? What

67
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,200
if you could use UTCP that is both

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,519
scalable and secure?

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,280
What is UTCP? Well, UTCP is a protocol

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,360
that actually uses your battle tested

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,519
infrastructure to connect it to the API.

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,160
It's secure, it's scalable, and it's

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,239
neutral by definition. It's secure

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,760
because it connects it makes the

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,360
connection directly without having to

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,959
add a new layer. Um, that could be a

77
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,879
security challenge. It's scalable

78
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,000
because it's lightweight and very easy

79
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,840
to implement for the agents and it's

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,280
completely open source and neutral.

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,599
We're actually even talking to the Linux

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,239
Foundation so to make sure that UTCP is

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,560
as vendor neutral as possible.

84
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,400
Now what is the secret sauce? Why does

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,560
this work? Well, let me compare a very

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,800
quick comparison to MCP maybe to get a

87
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,640
hands-on who knows about MCP in this

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,159
room.

89
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,239
All right. Um, so MCP, what MCP does is

90
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,920
it adds a new server between your API

91
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,239
and your agent. That creates a huge

92
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,000
security risk because it could either be

93
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,680
an MCP server that you don't know or

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,120
even if you build it yourself, it could

95
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,920
be a new attack surface for people to

96
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,319
jam. However, with UTCP, what we do is

97
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,400
we actually do these instruction set,

98
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,159
these descriptions, what we call

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,640
templates that just describe to the

100
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,319
agent how to call the API, what par

101
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,799
parameters are used, and what data does

102
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,400
it need, etc., etc., etc. But that way

103
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,959
keeps the security in check and the

104
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,640
scalability also

105
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,480
implemented.

106
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,760
So we have already been working with

107
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,000
companies to actually implement this and

108
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,680
we see the engineering effort is so much

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,599
less. You don't need a new MCP server

110
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,120
for every API. You don't need to buy to

111
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,239
build custom integrations for every

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,480
agent. Um the workload is much much more

113
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,280
lightweight meaning faster innovation

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,600
for you, less engineers and stronger

115
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,680
capabilities faster. For example, we're

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,360
working with senior architects at AWS

117
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,840
that have a lot of independent server

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,479
providers. And these ISPs have just a

119
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,400
lot a lot a lot of internal APIs. And

120
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,479
what Luca Prosi said, for example, a

121
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,680
senior architect at AWS was that they

122
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,600
could reimplement everything

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,600
theoretically for their clients, but it

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,280
was just too much work to do with MCP.

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,120
And with UTCP, they get the security

126
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,919
they need, the scalability at a fraction

127
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,919
of the engineering effort. So if you

128
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,840
want to deploy LLM agents and you want

129
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,440
to do it faster and securely, we'd love

130
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,680
to talk to you. We'll be at the exhibit

131
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,280
right there. Um I would love to speak

132
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,280
about how you can make autonomous

133
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,880
agentic first organizations. Thank you

134
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,683
very much and it was a pleasure talking

135
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,080
to you.

136
00:04:58,683 --> 00:05:02,240
[applause]

137
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,240
>> Thanks Juan. Any questions from the

138
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,240
audience?

139
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,160
>> Well, can you tell me why do other

140
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,520
protocols fall short fall short in the

141
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,759
security? Yeah. So actually the only

142
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,680
other protocol is MCP. Um the other

143
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,440
protocols I don't know how this works.

144
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,400
The other protocols are usually agent to

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,160
agent or even agent commerce but MCP

146
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,360
specifically just improves the attack

147
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,600
surface whenever you're building it

148
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,280
yourself. And what happens a lot is

149
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,880
there are existing MCP servers you

150
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,120
connect can connect your agents to but

151
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,120
they are unverified and they could be

152
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,360
they could inject malware or inject a

153
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,000
lot of bad context to your LM agents. So

154
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,360
UTCP kind of uses existing

155
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,720
infrastructure instead.

156
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,280
>> Any more audience?

157
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,759
>> Okay, one more question. Why does UTCP

158
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,680
require less engineering effort?

159
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,320
>> Yeah, so once you have like hundreds or

160
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,240
more of potential APIs or data sources,

161
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,639
it just requires a lot of effort to

162
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,560
rebuild your infrastructure.

163
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,800
Essentially, the internet is being

164
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,400
rebuilt for the AI agents, right? We're

165
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,440
talking about all of the internet being

166
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,360
accessible and you can rebuild all of it

167
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,600
and have to rebuild all the security for

168
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,840
AI agents or you can leverage it and

169
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,800
connected directly to LLMs even as they

170
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,199
get more capable. So that way it's just

171
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,440
much more straightforward.

172
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:27,440
>> Thank you so much Juan. All right,

173
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,759
any other questions? All right. Okay.

174
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,160
Thank you.

175
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,160
>> Thank you very much.
