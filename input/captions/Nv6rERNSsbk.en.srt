1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,639
So we've heard amazing talks about

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,800
models, foundation models and

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,080
non-foundational models and wormholes

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,840
and many many other things. Um it's

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,359
wormholes plugging the wormholes, right?

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:28,760
Um so

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:33,119
um eventually children do ask their

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,119
parents where do data come

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,239
from? And so this session is to address

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,399
that question. All of these models

11
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,960
depended on data. But where do data come

12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,480
from? Where did like large data come

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,480
from? Well, somebody thinks up a method.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,680
Well, first somebody thinks up what data

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,719
do I wish I had and then figures out

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,879
ways to get it and there's of course a

17
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,879
happy interaction with the analysis end.

18
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,719
These of course talk to each other but

19
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,879
the data getting and the data organizing

20
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,880
and the data cleaning and the data all

21
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,240
sorts of things is an amazing wonderful

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,880
thing. So I think it's wonderful that

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:16,280
today we have a panel devoted entirely

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:21,360
to novel largecale data creation colon

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,400
genomes cells tissues and organisms.

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,400
We are going to do it in that order

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,080
except we're well we're going to start

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,759
really with the cells I guess and then

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,400
work our way to the tissues and then

30
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,079
work our way to the

31
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,320
organisms because um we're going to

32
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,159
first hear about about cells and cell

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,920
imaging. We're going to hear about then

34
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,479
tissue imaging and more tissue imaging

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,280
and two wonderful talks on that. And

36
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,720
then to just show how much this is this

37
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,320
is an oraoros that follows its own tail.

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,240
Mark daily is both genomes and organisms

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,560
because he's looking at the genome of

40
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,240
the organism just as you can start

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,240
wherever you want to and go around like

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,239
that. They're going to be great talks.

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,879
You're now awake you're seated and we're

44
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,560
going to first start with Shantanu Singh

45
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,959
who's senior group leader in the imaging

46
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,239
platform at the broad. He leads a data

47
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,959
science group that develops

48
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,480
computational and statistical methods to

49
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,800
create fingerprints of genes and

50
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,920
chemicals and diseases from microscopic

51
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,560
images of cells. Shantine, all yours.

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,319
Thank

53
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,720
you. Am I audible at the back? It's

54
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,959
good. Thanks, Eric. I have 12 minutes,

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,560
so I'll I'll jump right into it. U

56
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,720
with with the slide. This um you know

57
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,000
our lab believes that that images of

58
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,200
cells that look like this are uh

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,319
incredibly and uncannily informative of

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,080
cell state and that if we use computer

61
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:57,040
vision methods to to extract uh to to

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,200
identify every cell in this image and

63
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,000
extract features from them uh that's a

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,959
really effective way of of of capturing

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,800
that information. And that if we can do

66
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,760
this for cheap, we can do this at scale.

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,720
And and that scale matters when u

68
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,599
anytime you're doing biology, when

69
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,360
you're doing a whole bunch of

70
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,280
experiments, thousands of experiments in

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,560
parallel, for example, knocking out a

72
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,760
whole genome worth of genes or or

73
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,720
screening a compound library with

74
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,319
millions of compounds in it. Okay. So,

75
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,080
so the things in the lab that that we

76
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,239
care about are first how do we make

77
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,319
images of cells like this richer in

78
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,519
information uh so that we can get more

79
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,280
out of it but but keep it cheap. All

80
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,640
right. How do we then extract

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,159
information from these images to create

82
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,120
profiles? How do we uh then then use

83
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,360
those profiles to solve problems in drug

84
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,200
discovery and and functional genomics

85
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,840
for example? And then importantly and

86
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,680
very relevant to this discussion today,

87
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,760
how do we then produce a lot of data

88
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,480
that will help us make these discoveries

89
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,319
but then also um train AI models to help

90
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,920
us make those discoveries. So the way

91
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,760
we've approached it in the lab I'll just

92
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,920
go in order of this you know making

93
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,920
these information uh these images richer

94
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,840
in information. We invented the the cell

95
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,479
painting assay here at the broad along

96
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,120
with the tribal lab and goal was to pack

97
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,520
in as many stains as we could into a

98
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,680
single imaging assay to mark all these

99
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,160
organels the this confederacy of

100
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,639
subcellular uh structures as Jennifer

101
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,759
told us morning. going to use that term

102
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,520
uh going forward. And and uh

103
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,720
importantly, we we kept this protocol

104
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,040
open and we kept it cheap and we made it

105
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,440
easy to use so that it's now been widely

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,680
adopted uh by by the pharma industry and

107
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,199
a lot of academic labs uh that routinely

108
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,440
use it for for phenotyping. Many labs

109
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,000
have uh adapted it when the biology

110
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,960
demands to to suit their needs. uh many

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,400
broadies here have uh adapted it to

112
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,680
study heart cells and and brain cells

113
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,840
and and fat cells um and and adapted it

114
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,840
uh as as it's been been relevant to

115
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,360
those to those cell types. So, so given

116
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,680
these images, uh, given these rich

117
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,080
images, uh, how do you then extract

118
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,560
information from them? The the so-called

119
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,720
image based profiling workflow is fairly

120
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,039
straightforward. Uh, you you start with

121
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,919
you start with a pool of cells and then

122
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,240
you perturb them in some way and uh, let

123
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,800
them grow for a bit. You fix them, you

124
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,039
stain them with dyes and uh, image them

125
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,520
under a high throughput microscope and

126
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,680
then use image analysis software uh,

127
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,360
typically to identify each cell. uh you

128
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,759
don't always have to do that as we saw

129
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,199
earlier this morning and then extract a

130
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,800
whole bunch of features from them.

131
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,080
Thousands of features. The fact that

132
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,680
it's thousands is going to be relevant.

133
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,160
We'll probably chat about that a little

134
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,840
later during our discussion today. But

135
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,560
uh you know take all those measurements

136
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,160
and then uh summarize them them in some

137
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,400
way. Typically just average them. It's a

138
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,800
great way of summarizing things and then

139
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,720
those individual those those profiles as

140
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,720
we call it those imagebased profiles are

141
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,400
now representing the population of cells

142
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
that we that we started studying. So we

143
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,319
have now these um image based profiles

144
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,600
for the millions or thousands hundreds

145
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,000
of thousands of perturbations that you

146
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,280
might have started with right uh and and

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,240
then we do a whole bunch of downstream

148
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,639
tasks with them and I'll talk about them

149
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,319
about a few of those obviously with any

150
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,680
uh such bionformatics workflow comes

151
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,759
with its own complications and we've

152
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,919
built a bunch of tools to to help us

153
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,440
along the way with that okay so we've

154
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,960
got these uh now we have these

155
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,039
imagebased profiles we have these

156
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,280
imagebased profiles uh what do we do

157
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,080
with them how do we how do we use them

158
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,759
to solve problems in drug discovery and

159
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,000
functional genomics and uh there are

160
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,520
many examples I have time for just two

161
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,360
of them today that I thought would would

162
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,319
be most relevant to to what we're going

163
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,280
to chat about um so we may ask for

164
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,360
example can we identify signatures of

165
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,840
disease and then and then screen for

166
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,759
drugs that that reverse that disease to

167
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,840
find potential therapeutics so I'll

168
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,919
focus here on this on this um

169
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,240
collaboration with Miko Taipali's lab in

170
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,720
the University of Toronto uh who are

171
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,039
interested in studying the impact of of

172
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,199
coding variation on the localization of

173
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,960
proteins to see where they to see to see

174
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,120
where they lie and how that changes. So

175
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,560
for example, take this example of this

176
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,880
protein LZTR1. That's what it looks like

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,599
in a cell. That's how it it localizes.

178
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,960
Uh but if you consider a if you consider

179
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,000
a variant of it that has uh that is

180
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,759
positive believe of Nunan syndrome um

181
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,479
the localization is significantly

182
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,479
different and consistently different and

183
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,199
importantly then what that gives you is

184
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,360
a screenable phenotype which is to say

185
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,360
that now you can go and screen for

186
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,759
compounds that might revert the

187
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,000
phenotype to look back like a reference

188
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,479
type like like a sort of healthy

189
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,560
reference al right Um and and Miko's lab

190
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,440
had has had studied about 3,500 more

191
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,440
than 3,500 uh disease associated

192
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,319
variants together with their wild type

193
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,720
together with their reference

194
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,160
counterparts uh and found screenable

195
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,960
phenotypes for about 200 of them which

196
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,120
is a uh which is a small fraction uh but

197
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,039
a huge number especially when you think

198
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,440
about the fact that you probably want to

199
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,280
do drug screens for each of these. uh we

200
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,800
are now scaling this up together with a

201
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,360
with a bunch of friends across many

202
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,479
different labs and uh scaling this up

203
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,800
20fold or so um and screening many more

204
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,000
uh disease associated variants and now

205
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:32,080
we're faced with a new bottleneck which

206
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,320
is how do we do uh 200 drug screens and

207
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,120
maybe 4,000 drug screens once this large

208
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,680
data set is

209
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:43,440
created. So, so for that we we turn to a

210
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,160
technology uh developed um by JT Neil

211
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,080
and Paul Blay's lab here at the Broad.

212
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,000
Um uh and the idea is fairly

213
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
straightforward when I describe it like

214
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,760
this, which is to say that you just take

215
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,920
these 24 well plates uh and then you

216
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,640
pull you you you you plate each each

217
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,519
well with uh with the same with cells

218
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,920
coming from the same pool uh each cell

219
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,680
uh which is is uh is overexpressing one

220
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,000
of the 400 or so alals that we are

221
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,279
studying uh in this experiment which is

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,080
a mix of the uh disease caring causing

223
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,240
variance and the corresponding reference

224
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:21,200
alles. uh we then treat each well with

225
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,839
uh with a compound and then we look for

226
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,000
cases where the compound is rescuing is

227
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,720
reverting uh the signature of the

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,560
disease associated al back to looking

229
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,000
like a reference type right and that's

230
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,600
it that that's really what we're trying

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,360
to do here and of course there's a big

232
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
there's a big question as to how do you

233
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,120
how do you

234
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,320
um how do you deconvolute the pool to

235
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,519
figure out which cell got which which

236
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,120
protein and we we we took the same this

237
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,560
the we took a fair took the same

238
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,519
approach here which is that we first

239
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,279
stain the cells to mark the um to mark

240
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,120
the localization and to see whether

241
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,880
where the protein localizes and also

242
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,360
cell morphology using cell painting. We

243
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,720
wash those dyes off and then use a

244
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,160
technology you're all familiar with in

245
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,440
C2 sequencing to read out the barcode uh

246
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,080
that will help you identify uh which um

247
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,600
which protein was overexpressed in in in

248
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,240
which cell and that's about it.

249
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,079
Obviously a lot more to the protocol uh

250
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,880
than I described but essentially

251
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:22,560
technology a technology like this can uh

252
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,320
dramatically scale up um drug screens

253
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,880
and we have a pilot uh experiment

254
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,880
underway to to test this out. All right.

255
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,040
Uh I'll give a very quickly another

256
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,560
example as to whether we can use um you

257
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,440
know image based profiling to identify

258
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,360
gene function by grouping similar genes

259
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,279
and alals. And here uh in a large

260
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,040
collaboration including calico, we

261
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,200
knocked out every gene in in the human

262
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,200
genome uh by crisper and then used the

263
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,480
same pool bar coding technology and cell

264
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,160
painting um uh to to profile them. And

265
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,160
this allowed us to visualize the

266
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,720
phenotypic landscape of the several

267
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,880
thousands of genes that had a detectable

268
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,880
phenotype. we we saw meaningful clusters

269
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,600
emerge with neighborhoods of related

270
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,079
genes clustering together. There are

271
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,920
many more such examples of of using

272
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,440
imagebased profiling in this way and

273
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,519
these slides are available for download.

274
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,760
So you can look them up and especially

275
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,360
that that recent review article uh that

276
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,360
reviews the progress in this field over

277
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,680
the last decade would be a good way to

278
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,519
catch up on what's going on here. But I

279
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,000
will uh I will switch to now just

280
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,839
talking about about the data creation.

281
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How do we now scale all this up? How do

282
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,079
we produce massive amounts of data so

283
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,920
that we can enable these discoveries but

284
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,079
then also train machine learning models

285
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,839
to help us make those discoveries? And

286
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,600
the approach that we took, we're we're a

287
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,519
small but mighty lab. So the the

288
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,000
approach that we took is is to create a

289
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,120
community uh throughout pharma around

290
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,040
this technology. We launched the uh the

291
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,920
jump cell painting consortium in 2019

292
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,880
uh through uh which comprised 10 pharma

293
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,320
companies and and several academic labs

294
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,600
u led by us and together uh across all

295
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,240
these labs we produced the world's

296
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,760
largest cell painting data set

297
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,480
comprising 136,000

298
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,320
u pertibbations uh spanning about

299
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,120
three-folds of the human genome either

300
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,320
overexpressed or knocked out and over

301
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,720
100,000 compounds um in it all this data

302
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,440
and and a lot of single cells that that

303
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,959
that is indeed a billion single 100 1.6

304
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,480
billion single cells. So all of this

305
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,839
data is publicly available on AWS um

306
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,920
thanks to their thanks to their

307
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,959
generosity. We don't pay the $50,000 it

308
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,200
takes to host it every month and uh you

309
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,920
can uh you can download that. We have

310
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,040
built tools to we built tools to explore

311
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,880
it. Um others have built tools to

312
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,440
explore it as well. You can check all

313
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,880
this out. uh and the the there's very

314
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,399
quick adoption of this in in uh in the

315
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,920
field. These are papers that just came

316
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,800
out within the first several months of

317
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,720
the of the data being released. Um this

318
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,240
encouraged us to launch another

319
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,120
consortium recently, the Oasis

320
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,200
consortium uh that is uh with many more

321
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,519
pharma companies and agrochemicals and

322
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,839
companies and and uh and academic groups

323
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,600
focused on a much narrower problem of uh

324
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,800
of predicting or being able to predict

325
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,600
liver toxicity of drugs uh in in humans

326
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,440
using uh cell painting uh data but then

327
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,040
also transcrytoics and other such omix

328
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,639
data to solve this very important

329
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,200
problem that JP referred to this morning

330
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,200
of uh the fact that 90% of drugs fail

331
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,880
and a lot of those a lot of that 90% is

332
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,839
actually toxicity. If we can do this

333
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,959
just using uh data like this using im

334
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,160
using imaging and other such

335
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,000
technologies that would be great. So

336
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,440
this data is also going to be coming out

337
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,600
and maybe I can chat a little bit about

338
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,320
that during our discussion. Uh all of

339
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,959
this data now allows us to solve a lot

340
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,399
of problems uh in biio medicine uh as

341
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,160
machine learning problems. Once you have

342
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,720
all this data, the problem of for

343
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,480
example learning representations of life

344
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,079
is you know needs needs a lot of data

345
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,040
and data that we generate through

346
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,040
consortia like this allow us allow us to

347
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,320
do that. uh we've been doing our own bit

348
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,000
in um creating benchmarks and data sets

349
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,240
for the machine learning community and

350
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,440
putting that out and also doing our own

351
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,519
uh bit in creating

352
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,800
um methods and and baselines for

353
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,720
representation learning because that's

354
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,600
something that we care about deeply uh

355
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,279
in this field. Um I am at the 20 second

356
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,519
mark so I am going to just stop there

357
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,920
and take the rest for our discussion and

358
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,519
thank our lab and all our collaborators

359
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,639
who have helped us along the way with

360
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,639
all of this.

361
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,959
Well, thank you Shantu for a fabulous

362
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,160
kickoff to the panel and for keeping it

363
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,480
on time because after we get each of the

364
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,880
four speakers talking for give or take

365
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,680
about 12 minutes. Um we're going to have

366
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,040
a general panel discussion where we'll

367
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,639
go deeper into all of these things. So

368
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,839
we shall immediately go to Shia Jwang

369
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,360
the David B. the Arnold Jr. Professor of

370
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,880
Science

371
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,279
um in the department of chemistry and

372
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,440
chemical biology at Harvard. Uh she is

373
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,600
an HHMI investigator and she is a

374
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:07,680
pioneer in developing me methods to look

375
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:11,560
at cells and beyond. So shall we thank

376
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,560
you very much for being here.

377
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,950
[Applause]

378
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,959
All right. So, uh

379
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,079
Oops. All right. Thank thank you Eric

380
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:41,760
for uh for moderating this exciting

381
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:45,680
panel and uh uh thank you uh Carolyn for

382
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,399
the for the uh kind invitation and uh

383
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,560
for 12 minutes I'll just I'm going to

384
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,959
talk about spatial genomics and

385
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,120
functional genomics and then usually I

386
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,639
give some introduction and so on and for

387
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,240
12 minutes I'm just going to skip all

388
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,720
that and then go directly to the uh uh

389
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,600
uh Murphish platform that We developed

390
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,920
that uh for spatial genomics and

391
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,480
functional genomics and then of course

392
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,079
you are aware of other spatial genomics

393
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,959
and functional genomics platforms and uh

394
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,360
you you've heard of Shatnu talking about

395
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,920
functional genomics already and Fchan

396
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,959
will talk more about spatial genomics.

397
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,040
So uh for Murfish let me just be uh very

398
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,639
brief without going into really the

399
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,480
details of what the method uh details of

400
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,279
the protocol but just to say the

401
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,399
capability. It is a genome scale imaging

402
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:41,680
approach that allow us to image uh

403
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,959
thousands or tens of thousands of genes

404
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,160
or genomic loi. And with these concepts

405
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,160
of uh uh aerobust barcoding uh

406
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,279
combinatorial labeling and sequential

407
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,440
imaging and with a combinatorial

408
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:57,759
approach it allow us to u image the

409
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,600
number of genes that grows exponentially

410
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,320
with the number of bits hence the number

411
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,600
of rounds. That's what allow us to scale

412
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,720
to thousands or or more more than 10,000

413
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,280
genes. And then of course with each uh

414
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,520
gene identified by multi-bit signal then

415
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,160
every bit the error accumulates over

416
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,160
multiple bits. Then the we uh develop

417
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,240
this error detection and correction

418
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,520
approach. So with that we can have

419
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,559
simultaneously high scalability and high

420
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,039
uh accuracy. And then this is a murfish

421
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,640
image of more than 10,000 genes. And

422
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,880
then uh I talk about cells too. So you

423
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,799
can see the cells individual dots are

424
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,720
RNAs that are colorcoded by their

425
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:44,160
genetic identity. So the ability to uh

426
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,240
do gene expression uh profiling unlike

427
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,559
single RNA sequencing in an imaging

428
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,080
approach we do it in situ without

429
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:54,320
destroying the spatial context. So with

430
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,280
that then we can identify through the

431
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,960
gene expression profile these cell types

432
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,960
in situ and then look into their uh

433
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,240
spatial organization which is critical

434
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,640
for tissue function and the cell cell

435
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,600
interactions and uh that has in my lab

436
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,000
we primarily use that for the brain and

437
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,280
uh many other labs have used it for a

438
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,960
variety of other uh tissues and organs

439
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,799
uh from model organisms to human. So,

440
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,919
uh, what I'm going to show you here is

441
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,799
just one such example that we did for

442
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,240
the whole mouse brain where we imaged

443
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:36,000
more than 1,000 genes in the about 10

444
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,160
million cells and then built the whole

445
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,880
cell al the cell atlas of the whole

446
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,559
mouse brain. We also integrated our

447
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,320
murfish data with the uh uh singles RNA

448
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,880
sequencing data taken by

449
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:54,080
our collaborator uh Alan Institute the

450
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,640
Hungu Jen's team uh in the same

451
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,200
consortium in parallel and then we uh

452
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,919
then even get the genomewide not only

453
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,720
identify the cell types in situ but also

454
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,679
can do a imputation to get the

455
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,039
genomewide expression profile of every

456
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,520
imaged genes.

457
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,000
And with that we can identify an

458
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,520
extraordinary diversity of cells diff

459
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,120
you know hundreds of different major

460
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,840
cell types and thousands of

461
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,400
transcriptionally distinct clusters and

462
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,559
their complex spatial organization. And

463
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,559
this is a scanning from the anterior to

464
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,400
posterior. Every dot every dot is a

465
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,400
cell. They're colored by their cell

466
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,280
type. And then you can query in an

467
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,880
interactive way uh of where different

468
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,520
types of cells are there in the

469
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,440
different uh brain area. And then uh

470
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:44,000
through their uh gene expression

471
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,720
profiles and uh uh spatial proximity we

472
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,880
can also infer cell interactions and

473
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,880
also the ligan receptor basis and

474
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,960
functional implications of these cell

475
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,360
cell

476
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,160
interactions. And uh you know speaking

477
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,640
of data being very useful for model we

478
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,799
also make our data very uh you know

479
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,120
publicly available in an interactive way

480
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,440
through this uh you know really

481
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,880
wonderful uh portal that Allen Institute

482
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,160
put together. So and then we also uh

483
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:19,200
extended murfish to do epigenomic

484
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:21,679
uh imaging and that's by using uh uh

485
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:26,160
antibbody recognizing epigenetic marks

486
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:29,440
and then fused to TM5 that cut the uh

487
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,679
epig genetic element into fragments and

488
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,000
then uh tag them and then image was

489
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,440
smurfish and then this labeling approach

490
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,919
is inspired by the cut and tac approach

491
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,640
uh pioneered Steven Hanukov and then we

492
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,520
can actually not only image the RNAs but

493
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,840
also image the epigenetic elements and

494
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,960
then study their correlation in terms of

495
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,320
how epigenomics connects to gene

496
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,919
expression and as you've heard from a

497
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,080
number of talks in the morning that the

498
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,080
3D genome organization is also an

499
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,039
important gene expression regulation

500
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,000
mechanism. We also extended murfish to

501
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,640
uh 3D genome imaging and in this case we

502
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,559
use murfish to identify genomic lossi

503
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,480
thousands of them and then

504
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:14,320
uh identify them and localize them so

505
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,159
that we can trace the 3D genome

506
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,480
confirmation and we can do it in

507
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,400
multimodal manner together with RNA so

508
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,679
that we can study the relationship

509
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,240
between gene expression 3D genome

510
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:28,720
organization all in a native tissue

511
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,640
context where we also label the uh

512
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,039
nuclear structures. So with the protein

513
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,120
marks such as nuclear oli and nuclear

514
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,360
lamina and the nuclear speckle and so

515
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,720
on. So that we can query that connection

516
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,000
between 3D genome organization and uh uh

517
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,320
transcription all in the native nucleus

518
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,559
context also directly in tissue in a

519
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,799
cell type specific manner by combining

520
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,200
RNA and DNA then we can see how

521
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:57,120
different cell types have different uh

522
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:00,080
3D genome organization. So uh and then

523
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,919
uh the I'm saving most of my time for

524
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,640
this last topic is functional genomics

525
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:09,120
and uh so from this kind of a genome

526
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,039
scale imaging measurements or other kind

527
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,120
of a genome scale imaging measurements

528
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,799
imaging or sequencing you know it's

529
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,760
really uh a wonderful way of collecting

530
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:23,200
a lot of data to describe the cell

531
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:26,559
states with a very high dimensionality.

532
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,200
So you learn a lot uh but that's still a

533
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,440
description. So if you want to know the

534
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,679
causality to say you know which gene

535
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,080
performs which function you know the

536
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,159
causality building the most powerful

537
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,960
approach is through genetic perturbation

538
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,880
such as crisper you know perturbation

539
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,559
and so on. So you delete the gene and

540
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,679
then see what kind of a function get

541
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,600
lost. So uh well after we developed

542
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,039
Murfish one of the first applications

543
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:56,400
that we thought is indeed using Murfish

544
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,559
to do imaging based pulled screening and

545
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,039
the pulled screening is very powerful

546
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,679
again as Shnu has already talked about

547
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,200
because you can query many many

548
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:08,080
perturbivations or the loss of many many

549
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,480
genes simultaneously in one sample and

550
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,240
each cell gets a different pertivation

551
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,840
and then you can try to measure their

552
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,320
phenotype difference. So then you can

553
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,760
build genotype phen phenotype maps in a

554
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,000
very high throughput manner. And then uh

555
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,400
if you do that by the traditional

556
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,320
approach such as fact sorting or cell

557
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,280
survival and so on the phenotype that

558
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,919
you can query is relatively simple. But

559
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,000
a lot of the cellular phenotypes are

560
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,919
really best measured by high resolution

561
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,360
imaging such as subcellular structures

562
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,520
dynamics and then also the imaging give

563
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,919
you the the the cell interaction the

564
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,760
spatial information even at the tissue

565
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,080
level so that you can see non- cell

566
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,320
autonomous effect one perturbed cell how

567
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,120
it affects neighboring cells and so on.

568
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,960
Now one of the challenges in terms of uh

569
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,360
this kind of imaging based to pull

570
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,919
genetic screening is after you image the

571
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,720
phenotype you got to see say hey which

572
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,880
cell got which perturbivation and then

573
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,280
with murfish then we thought of that

574
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,679
naturally because we could then link the

575
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,600
pertivation guide RNA and so on or even

576
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,919
a mutation of a protein base type of

577
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,000
mutation of a protein to a barcode and

578
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,880
then we can use the murfish to read out

579
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,039
the barcode and then this way. So uh so

580
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,679
we've published these couple of early on

581
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,840
papers both in terms of uh actually

582
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,880
screening out protein mutations and

583
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,760
screening out to crisper guide RNA in in

584
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,240
vitro system and then recently in

585
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,760
collaboration with Jonathan Weissman lab

586
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:43,200
we extended this to a multimodal invivo

587
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:46,880
p screening approach by actually uh

588
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,679
combining both murfish for imaging based

589
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,159
screening and perturb seek for sequence.

590
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,000
ing based screening all in tissue so

591
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:58,000
that we can we developed a lot of uh you

592
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,159
know protocols that allow us to both get

593
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,559
high resolution let me actually show you

594
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,640
the images protein images with

595
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,200
morphology preserved and then yet still

596
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,120
can measure many RNAs hundreds to

597
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,520
thousands of RNAs for transcriptional

598
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,480
profiling but in the same fixed tissue

599
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,720
sample we can do a perturb seek so that

600
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,960
we can get the transcripttonwide

601
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,039
uh phenotype so then as a demonst

602
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,679
Demonstration of that we actually

603
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,679
applied to the liver and then perturbed

604
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,320
hundreds of genes and read out the

605
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,720
phenotypes through both RNA and dozens

606
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,600
of morphology meaning protein imaging

607
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,880
and single cell perturb seek for uh

608
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,520
transcriptto while wide uh phenotype

609
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,600
imaging uh phenotype measurement with

610
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,600
this then it becomes a very high

611
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,960
throughput approach that allow us to

612
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,600
determine gene function and how genes

613
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,600
control cell and tissue function

614
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:57,279
directly in organ in vivo. So uh rather

615
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,039
than going details into these findings

616
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,120
uh but I do want to mention some of them

617
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,559
to show you that it is a very rich and

618
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,600
high throughput discovery approach. For

619
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:09,840
example, uh we actually find that uh for

620
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,559
those of you who know liver, you know

621
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,440
that liver has this beautiful zonation

622
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,360
pattern of the hpatocytes where cells

623
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,679
near the central vein and the

624
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,279
parapodoral region are uh quite

625
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,480
different in terms of their gene

626
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,760
expression profiles and functions for

627
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,159
hpatocytes. And then uh we actually

628
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,960
found a number of different previously

629
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,440
unknown genetic regulators that can

630
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,240
institute through transiffiation

631
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:41,039
actually change the zonation identity of

632
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:44,159
hpatocy. And uh also you can look into

633
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,880
really uh integral uh essential cell

634
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,279
stress pathways and ask the question of

635
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,640
uh hey whether these pathways can be

636
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:54,880
adapted for a organ specific or tissue

637
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,520
specific function. And one very

638
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,320
interesting thing that we found is that

639
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,480
such a highly conserved cell stress

640
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,120
pathway unfolded protein response

641
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,919
pathway in the liver has a specific

642
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,640
function and that it is to degrade the

643
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,159
uh plasma proteins that are secreted

644
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,760
such as elbooming a huge amount that are

645
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:19,240
secreted and then uh with unfolded

646
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,880
protein response we uh uh it actually

647
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,120
reduce you know substantially the mRNA

648
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,080
level of these plasma proteins so that

649
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,120
it reduce the folding burden of the ER

650
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,320
machinery. And then this final example

651
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,000
uh I see I'm

652
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,080
uh running out of time but let me say

653
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,120
this one is actually my favorite example

654
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,760
that really shows the power of combining

655
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,559
imaging and sequencing transcriptto wide

656
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,720
phenotype to see that we looked into

657
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,440
this phenotype which is very interesting

658
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,320
and very important p uh disease-wise.

659
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,919
It's the lipid accumulation or stosis.

660
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,200
And we found multiple different

661
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:02,880
pertivations can all induce this

662
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,679
physiological phenotype of stosis. But

663
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,760
they actually by doing the uh sequencing

664
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,240
uh genomewide sequencing to see which

665
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,559
genes gets upregulated down reggulated.

666
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,440
We found that this convergent fe

667
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,120
physiological phenotype or pathological

668
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,039
phenotype actually can go through

669
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,279
multiple different pathways. So whether

670
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,840
it's a lipid bio things as upregulation

671
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:27,039
or stress pathway upregulation and

672
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,080
others and so on. So with this uh let me

673
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,559
just uh end by saying that you know in

674
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,480
the uh th those of you who love

675
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,279
foundation model building or other

676
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,200
things for virtual cells and so on one

677
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,360
of the major missing thing the sparse

678
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,840
data is on the perturbation side. So

679
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,159
this functional genomics data will be

680
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,399
very helpful. So I'm sorry for not

681
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,799
having time to uh acknowledge the people

682
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,720
who have done the work and so uh so let

683
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,960
me just say that the last bit I do want

684
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,480
to because I spent time on it. It was a

685
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,360
very wonderful collaboration with

686
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,440
Jonathan Weissman and the uh my uh

687
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,679
former postto who's also independent

688
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,279
Harvard junior fellow will Allen now a

689
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,200
uh taking independent position at

690
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:11,399
Stanford and the Jonathan's graduate

691
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,399
student Ruben Saunders.

692
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,679
Fantastic.

693
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,159
Fantastic talk and also well compressed

694
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,440
into almost 12 minutes but well done.

695
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,279
Well done. Next up we have Fay Chen. Fay

696
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,000
is a core institute member at the Broad

697
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,760
and assistant professor in scrub the

698
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,039
department of stem cell and regenerative

699
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,840
biology at Harvard and he is building

700
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:43,880
tools that bridge single cell genomics

701
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:47,520
with space and time. So Fay, all

702
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:51,120
yours. Oh, and he was previously a

703
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,320
Schmidt fellow at the Broad.

704
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,640
All right. Does this work? Okay, great.

705
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,320
Uh I'm very impressed by how much

706
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,720
Shallow can manage to compress into our

707
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,799
12-minute talk. Uh and again, I usually

708
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,000
have introductory slides which I will

709
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,679
skip. uh because actually today's uh

710
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,960
sessions have really illuminated that

711
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,840
the fact that you know people are

712
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,840
thinking about spatial data all the time

713
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,799
uh and the interaction between spatial

714
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,080
and single cell data and I think

715
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:20,600
fundamentally a lot of us are interested

716
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,000
in this question of how are cells

717
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,240
organized and influenced by their

718
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,840
environment and how you can think about

719
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,200
that is that you might have cell types

720
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,960
and they might have transcriptional

721
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,000
changes you might call them cell states

722
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,279
but somehow in tissues in vivo that's

723
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,960
affected by what this thinking of you

724
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,960
know where does the cell live what it's

725
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,880
or cells what is the organization of

726
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,039
cell types around it what cells is it

727
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,799
interacting with and often times what is

728
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,640
it communicating with and then

729
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,960
ultimately how does this feed back to

730
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,399
shape a cell's identity and for a long

731
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,520
time we've really only been able to

732
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,279
study this uh in dissociated context and

733
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,799
I I won't belabor the point but I think

734
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,159
there's been new technologies that have

735
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,679
enabled us to start studying this uh in

736
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,880
taking genome omic measurements and

737
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,760
making them directly in the tissue

738
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,440
context and it's becoming extremely

739
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,840
scalable and I just added this just some

740
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,240
food for thought or maybe questions to

741
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,600
the parents that Eric mentioned what are

742
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,760
we going to talk about in this talk well

743
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,360
what can we learn from spatial data

744
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,440
maybe some what are some outstanding

745
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,960
modeling questions and then what about

746
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,720
uh the future for data collection not

747
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,360
the data for data collection okay and um

748
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,320
our lab uh has built some tools in the

749
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,880
past couple years uh on to measure the

750
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,880
transcriptto, the genome, as well as

751
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,000
other types of genomic features directly

752
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:42,320
in tissues. And a lot of this has been

753
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,720
focused on being able to capture the

754
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,360
mRNA, spatially barcode the mRNA onto

755
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,559
these arrays which allow you uh to

756
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,279
capture the XY location of sequences of

757
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:56,480
mRNA and DNA directly from your tissues.

758
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,480
And um this has been commercialized and

759
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,480
and there's a 10X also offers this

760
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,080
Vizium which is very similar. But

761
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,480
recently we've developed this technology

762
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,559
called slide tags which we believe is a

763
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,240
universal approach to jointly measure

764
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,000
single cells and then know where those

765
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,279
cells come from. And I'm just going to

766
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,960
take one minute to talk about the

767
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,240
technology before really talking about

768
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,559
what can we learn from this sort of

769
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,559
data. Um because the you know the data

770
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,320
modality is generally generalized across

771
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,559
all spatial data and and the concept

772
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,559
behind psychics is quite simple just

773
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,000
like perform your SQL cell sequencing

774
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,760
and know where your cells are from the

775
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,600
tissue. And so how this works is that

776
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,000
you can put a tissue onto an array of

777
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,519
barcoded beads and these beads encode

778
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,240
their XY location in a sequence barcode

779
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,679
and when these beads are also photo

780
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,960
cleavieable. So they get when you

781
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,360
photocle cleave them they actually

782
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,320
release this barcode into the cells and

783
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,799
then when you sequence the cells you get

784
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,640
for each cell a collection of barcodes

785
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,679
that barcodes where that cell came from

786
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,120
in XY. It's like GPS for the cell. And

787
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,720
so at the end of the day, you can just

788
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,640
perform single cell sequencing and you

789
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,320
know the XY location of the cell as well

790
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,000
as the gene expression across the

791
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,240
transcriptto at the single cell

792
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,960
resolution. You can also do single cell

793
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,640
for epigenomes etc. And so so there are

794
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,799
some advantages. It's true single cell

795
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,120
resolution is really high molecular

796
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,880
sensitivity and genomic and epigenomic

797
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,240
measurements. But for the purposes of

798
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,720
this talk, I I want to take a step back

799
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,200
and just talk ask what can we learn

800
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,120
about from spatial data because you know

801
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,360
at the end of the day you get this gene

802
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,120
expression matrix with XY coordinates.

803
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,159
So how are we going to think about or we

804
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:31,679
want to take away? Well, one idea that I

805
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,200
want to want the audience to take away

806
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,760
from this this talk is that you know um

807
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,679
changes in spatial context within a

808
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,360
tissue are often times you can almost

809
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,919
think of them as natural pertabbational

810
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,000
experiments where the pertibbation is

811
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,679
maybe your cell is experiencing a

812
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,200
different spatial context or a signal

813
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,279
different signaling environment and um

814
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,279
and then you can use that to maybe learn

815
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,120
something about what that pertubation

816
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,159
does to the cell or how does that change

817
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,519
the cell state. And you know, this h

818
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,519
probably happens in many different

819
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,760
contexts, but in particular, it probably

820
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,679
happens a lot in the immune system and

821
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,399
it probably happens a lot in in in the

822
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,240
cancer micro environment in the immune

823
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:13,919
system. And this this idea I think is

824
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,919
kind of cool because you can allow it

825
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,320
allows you to measure these sorts of

826
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,000
perturbational effects in human samples

827
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,079
where perturbations are often not

828
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,320
feasible. Um I think maybe this you know

829
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,320
for that interest of time there's just

830
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,159
many types of cells in the tumor micro

831
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,720
environment and they might assume

832
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,440
different states and they have different

833
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:39,119
interactions and importantly probably

834
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,720
the functions of these cells and their

835
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,879
interactions are directly maybe

836
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,760
therapeutically relevant. We have many

837
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:47,679
therapies that take advantage of um

838
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,960
check such as checkpoint blockcade or T-

839
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,960
cell therapies that take advantage of

840
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,520
interactions of cells or the states of

841
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,960
cells. Um and so I'll just give you an

842
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,640
example in uh melanoma about how we

843
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,320
think about one how tissue organization

844
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,520
is related to the state of cells and

845
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,119
then I'll talk to you about something

846
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,119
about how we might use these natural

847
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,079
perturbational experiments. So here we

848
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,680
just applied some slide tags data to um

849
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,200
you know just a takeaway from this is

850
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,920
that we applied some tags data to

851
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,680
melanoma specimens. We can reconstruct

852
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,480
single cell data directly into the

853
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,079
spatial context and you find that there

854
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,440
are different here are the tumor cells

855
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,839
and you find that the tumor cells

856
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,359
exhibit transcriptional variability and

857
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,160
that this transcriptional variability

858
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,359
maps directly into different spatial

859
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,280
contexts and not only are they

860
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,359
transcriptionally variable they also

861
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,520
arise from different genomic clones. So

862
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,960
there's some evolutionary process that's

863
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,760
driving the transcriptional variability

864
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,000
as as well as the spatial localization.

865
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,720
And one question then you have is that

866
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,040
you know um is this is this spatial

867
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,720
variability related to uh the intera

868
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,400
like does the does the transcriptional

869
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,720
variability at all related to its

870
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,960
environment? And so uh you know just

871
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,640
using some simple cell type

872
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,119
compositional analysis. We've talked a

873
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,720
lot about niches but you know one the

874
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,359
base analysis is just looking at the

875
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,240
relative composition of nearby cells. We

876
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,240
can find that one of these states is

877
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,320
very enriched in T- cells and another

878
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,000
state is very depleted in T- cells. So

879
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,440
there's these two regions and they have

880
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,960
different environments. They also are

881
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,000
enriched and depleted in a lot of other

882
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,760
stromal cells. And this this this

883
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,839
enrichment in CD8 T cells in particular

884
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,560
piqu our interest. And when you sequence

885
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:31,040
the TCRs, you can see that there's this

886
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,119
part particular TCR clone. So these are

887
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,640
the TCRs are like the sequences for the

888
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,920
T- cell receptors and that's what they

889
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,440
use to recognize the antigens. And

890
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,680
there's this particular clone which is

891
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,760
associated with one tumor clone. This is

892
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,599
like kind of a very surprising result.

893
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,480
Nobody has been able to sequence TCRs

894
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:50,000
and uh in space. And so um so here you

895
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,160
can see the purple dots represent one

896
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,920
this particular clone and the gray dots

897
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,880
represent the TCRs for all the other

898
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,000
clones. Um and so this is actually one

899
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,560
of the first times we can observe

900
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,359
directly T- cell clonality linked to a

901
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,560
specific genetic tumor clone. Now the

902
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,560
question is is this linked to the

903
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,240
antigen? Is this linked to the state?

904
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,839
We're not exactly sure, but what we're

905
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,880
doing is we're systematically collecting

906
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:15,040
lots and lots of uh melanoma specimens

907
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,560
and we're we're discovering uh it with

908
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,880
the spatial data and we're discovering

909
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,960
just as a highlight that there's a

910
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,440
direct coupling between micro

911
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,040
environmental niches and the tumor cell

912
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,839
states. So there I showed you one

913
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,119
example of there these two tumor clones

914
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,599
and they're associated with different

915
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,599
environments. We find that over this is

916
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,680
30 different tumors that here are

917
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,599
different tumor cell states or

918
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,079
transcriptional programs and these

919
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,920
include genetic clones but also just

920
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,200
environment like transcript true

921
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,960
transcriptional programs such as

922
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,040
interferon response or this

923
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,000
differentiation trajectory and they're

924
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,280
associated with particular niches. For

925
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,040
example, there's this particular

926
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,480
immunosuppressive niche that we're

927
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,880
finding quite interesting that's

928
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,200
associated with this differentiation and

929
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,200
this transitory neuropressant type which

930
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,040
is actually related to this T- cell

931
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,960
enrichment uh that you saw in the

932
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,680
previous sample. So that's this idea

933
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,680
that you know you can go and uncover uh

934
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,960
transcriptional lineage heterogeneity in

935
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,480
cancer cells and you know you get to ask

936
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,200
this question of like what what actually

937
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,040
dominates um these cellular communities.

938
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,119
Is it cell intrinsic states and lineages

939
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,960
that are shaping uh these interactions

940
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,680
or cell intrinsic environments? And I

941
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,480
just want to you know highlight one

942
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,200
initial example for for this idea that

943
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,839
local communication pathways are are

944
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,079
perturbations and that's this example um

945
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:41,359
actually in in a different cancer but

946
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,200
this idea that um well the sustained

947
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:45,200
growth factor is actually signaling is a

948
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,119
hallmark of cancer. from some cancers

949
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,520
instead of needing to mutate the

950
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,119
pathways uh that drive growth factor

951
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,040
signaling they co-opt their micro

952
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:55,520
environment to get them to supply these

953
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,000
signals in particular in Hodkkins

954
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,280
lymphoma only one to 2% of the cells are

955
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,400
tumor cells and they're surrounded by a

956
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,200
unique micro environment and you know

957
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,640
perhaps you can use this idea of this

958
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,480
intrinsic perturbation experiment to

959
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,960
identify what micro environmental

960
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,119
factors are are actually causing the

961
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,640
survival in this in these rare cancer

962
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,880
cells and that's What we did, we

963
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,480
performed it on very few samples. But I

964
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,880
think the key is that the intrinsic

965
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,920
variability gives you a lot of power and

966
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:27,040
we did a simple analysis. We just looked

967
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,680
at the enrichment of lians next to tumor

968
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,000
cells. And these lians that are enriched

969
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,119
next to these tumor cells, we postulated

970
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,720
might be ones that are responsible for

971
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,800
uh paracquin signaling actions

972
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,680
interactions that cause survival. And

973
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:46,400
when you do that you find um a list of

974
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,760
uh you find a list of immunosuppressive

975
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,400
and growth factors enriched as

976
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:55,119
paracqurine signals in particular 13 and

977
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,400
I 13 alpha uh alpha and we we have a

978
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,760
bunch of other supporting evidence but

979
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,960
importantly there are therapeutic

980
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,400
antibodies that have already been

981
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:07,520
approved that we then can test and see

982
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,640
that when you block I3 signaling you can

983
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,400
uh basically suppress tumor growth. Um,

984
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,240
and so this is kind of cool. So we we

985
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,000
leverage the intrinsic heterogeneity in

986
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,680
the sample in very few samples to

987
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,200
identify paracqurine growth sample

988
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,119
signals that support uh the growth of

989
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,520
these tumor cells and then it generated

990
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,880
this testable therapeutic hypothesis. So

991
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,640
like can we do this more more

992
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,359
systematically? Like can we just like

993
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,920
leverage this idea of changes in spatial

994
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:37,520
context, neighborhoods, interactions and

995
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,520
s signaling as natural

996
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:46,079
probab the samples uh the this data um

997
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,119
we today we really talked about and and

998
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,720
these are problems that we're all

999
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,160
working on. We need to think about how

1000
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,920
we define the organization of tissues uh

1001
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,839
including you know how we assign cell

1002
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,240
types and segmentation and these base

1003
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,920
level analyses but also how do we like

1004
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,680
think about what an environment is if

1005
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,520
we're thinking about the environment as

1006
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,960
a perturbation we have to be able to

1007
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,800
define these environments and we have to

1008
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,640
be able to compare them between samples

1009
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,480
although I just said that you know

1010
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,000
comparing them within a sample is better

1011
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,720
but you might also want to compare them

1012
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,640
between samples right and we might want

1013
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,680
to then have really strong statistical

1014
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,000
frameworks

1015
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,400
uh to look at uh differential expression

1016
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
and these signaling

1017
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,280
interactions. Okay, so this is modeling.

1018
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,560
I won't talk we're working on these but

1019
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,400
I won't talk about them because it's

1020
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,079
been talked about a lot today. And then

1021
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,079
I think we need to also collect

1022
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,480
different types of data like one area of

1023
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,040
data that we're excited about you know

1024
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,839
to collect is how does like mutations

1025
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,680
and somatic variation affect uh tissue

1026
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,560
organization function. This is another

1027
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,839
axis of intrinsic variation and I won't

1028
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,440
get go into the details but we're

1029
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,119
starting to collect true like single

1030
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,520
cell genome sequencing and transcryto

1031
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,720
sequencing directly in space. The other

1032
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,680
thing I think we need to do is we need

1033
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,240
to really scale the amount and the type

1034
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,800
of data. I like really do believe that

1035
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,119
we need true sequencing true single cell

1036
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,520
sequencing data and I think single cell

1037
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,640
sequencing has been scaling

1038
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,480
exponentially and so we need to develop

1039
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,319
new technologies to really exponentially

1040
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,319
scale the measurement of spatial data

1041
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,000
and uh we've been doing that in some

1042
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,000
ways to make it extremely extremely

1043
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,839
cheap and then lastly I think we need

1044
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,839
systematic approaches for manipulating

1045
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,599
cellular communities in vibo which shall

1046
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:24,720
we talked about but we're also excited

1047
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,720
about awesome

1048
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:31,520
[Applause]

1049
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,520
Fantastic. And thank you for the

1050
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:38,319
homework list. Uh so clearly stated

1051
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:40,880
there. Um we have one more talk and then

1052
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,200
we're going to have a panel. Um and

1053
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,560
we're going to start with a panelists

1054
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,480
asking each other questions, but then we

1055
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:50,240
will turn to the audience to jump into

1056
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,480
the conversation as well. So you should

1057
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,720
begin thinking about the questions you

1058
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,599
want to be asking during the

1059
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,880
conversation. But I have the

1060
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:01,839
extraordinary happiness to introduce

1061
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:06,160
Mark Daly with whom I have been working

1062
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:08,160
for nearly 40 years. That's a terrifying

1063
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,319
thought, but a very happy thought

1064
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,000
because it's been a very fun nearly 40

1065
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:15,280
years. Um Mark is an institute member at

1066
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,960
the Broad Institute. He's the

1067
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,319
co-director of the program in medical

1068
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,240
and population genetics. Um he's the

1069
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:27,119
founding uh chief of the analytical and

1070
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:30,079
translational genetics unit at MGH and

1071
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,839
uh for a number of years he was living

1072
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,000
in Helsinki

1073
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,359
um while still having at least one foot

1074
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,359
here in Boston as the uh director of the

1075
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,400
Institute of Molecular Medicine in

1076
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:45,280
Finland which I'm sure will become clear

1077
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,240
that Mark is is deeply deeply thoughtful

1078
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,000
about populations all over the world. So

1079
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,160
tell us about organisms and their

1080
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,560
genomes. I will. So I have the privilege

1081
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,440
of being at the start and the end of the

1082
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,760
cycle if you will. Um the earliest stage

1083
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:06,319
which we focus on for my entire career

1084
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:09,760
anyway. Um because of the unique causal

1085
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,440
arrow that can be drawn between the

1086
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,400
human genome variation that you're born

1087
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:18,880
with and your disease outcomes over your

1088
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:21,359
life course. Um it has been demonstrated

1089
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,520
but we won't go into details about it um

1090
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,400
with systematic analysis or if you

1091
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,319
prefer with notable examples that the

1092
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,240
discovery of genetic variance even

1093
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,680
through population studies such as I'll

1094
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:36,079
describe is a valid and strong entry

1095
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:41,280
point that enriches for ultimate

1096
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:44,880
clinical success. Um, the last 20 years

1097
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,319
of many of our lives have been spent

1098
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,480
getting a little bit older as you can

1099
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,599
probably see from that uh slide, but

1100
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,400
have been spent in compiling massive

1101
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,839
data sets of human genome variation and

1102
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,240
through population studies and

1103
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:01,920
phenotypes linking those to diseases.

1104
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,680
And I'll go into a few examples. Um, but

1105
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,720
that's not where I want to focus your

1106
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,599
attention because the genetic links

1107
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,839
between variation and disease outcome is

1108
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,400
largely an intellectually solved problem

1109
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:16,400
over the last 20 years from constructing

1110
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,240
the foundations of the first G-W was

1111
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,599
studies when the broad was first opening

1112
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:24,240
its doors. Um there has been dramatic

1113
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,920
discoveries of tens of thousands of

1114
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,880
variants associated to rare and

1115
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,480
mandelian disease, common protein,

1116
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,520
common protein coding variants

1117
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,000
associated to common diseases and tens

1118
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,480
of thousands of cancer driver mutations.

1119
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,920
And in addition, we've still barely

1120
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,240
scratched the surface in how we

1121
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,319
interpret the many of those findings

1122
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,160
that are in non-coding regions of the

1123
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,400
genome. So with that in mind, I think

1124
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,359
finding the genes is not the problem.

1125
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,160
The problem is really this is really

1126
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:59,119
challenging to read and interpret and

1127
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,960
what is its impact on patients

1128
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,240
ultimately and it hasn't been that

1129
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,160
great. As I said, there are good handful

1130
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,640
of examples, but there's clearly a huge

1131
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,440
gap in our ability to learn from this

1132
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,680
data. So, briefly, the progress that

1133
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,839
we've been making in human genetics, I

1134
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,599
just exemplify it with some results from

1135
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,520
inflammatory bowel disease. We're not

1136
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,119
going to go into um you heard some

1137
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,640
studies earlier about that. Um over the

1138
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,560
course of the last 20 years of

1139
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,960
genomewide association studies, these

1140
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,119
have been almost uniquely successful in

1141
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,200
inflammatory bowel disease. And then

1142
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,760
over the last 10 years, we've added on

1143
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,920
top of that the genome exo sequence of

1144
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,280
nearly a 100,000 inflammatory bowel

1145
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,079
disease patients, which is quite an

1146
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:45,520
accomplishment for a disease that's not

1147
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:48,400
that common in the human population. Um,

1148
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,119
with this, of course, there are dozens

1149
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,599
and dozens of low frequency coding

1150
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,160
variants conclusively linked to disease.

1151
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,000
And we've done this not just in IBD,

1152
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,319
we've done it in schizophrenia. We can

1153
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,599
compare and contrast the results. each

1154
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:07,440
of them produce quite plentiful results

1155
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,920
at this level. But while individual

1156
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:14,000
pinpoints on these graphs might be

1157
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:16,800
informative and allow you to um begin a

1158
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,560
drug targeting activity, it's hard to

1159
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,960
put the whole story together and to make

1160
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,880
sense of it in a way that would really

1161
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:26,720
describe that we are understanding

1162
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,880
disease. Um I won't go into natural

1163
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,079
selection as a factor but you find lots

1164
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,119
of things whether there's natural

1165
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:36,880
selection or not acting against it. Um

1166
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:40,640
so we moved on to over the last decade

1167
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:44,079
to focus on bioanks because and the text

1168
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:46,160
at the bottom would say it seemed to us

1169
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,079
to be the time to move from looking at

1170
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,920
one disease at a time to looking at all

1171
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,760
diseases simultaneously sort of

1172
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:55,839
everywhere all at once or what have you.

1173
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:58,520
Um, I moved to Finland, um,

1174
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:01,359
particularly, most notably because of a

1175
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:03,200
tremendously favorable and progressive

1176
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:06,079
legal structure that would allow you to

1177
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,079
do a nationwide project with really no

1178
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:11,440
barriers whatsoever, as you can see

1179
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,440
here. So, this is what Arno Pelote and I

1180
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,400
built. And what it allows you to do is

1181
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:20,319
consent a person to join this study and

1182
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:23,280
you immediately have a vast array of

1183
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:25,119
lifelong phenotypic data from all of the

1184
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,440
medical contacts that this person has

1185
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,920
ever had. What this looks like in

1186
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,240
reality is some of these data sources

1187
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,720
that are mandated by law and have been

1188
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,720
for more than 50 years to be collected

1189
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,480
and entered into a single national

1190
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,079
database. Although there are many

1191
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,640
different databases depending on the

1192
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:46,480
type of data. This is all available for

1193
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:48,800
data for research um use. And to take

1194
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,640
one example, the last 10 years, you know

1195
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,079
how you have a patient portal? Well, you

1196
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,319
can go to your patient portal and see

1197
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,520
your lab values. We can essentially go

1198
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:59,520
to 500,000 people's patient portal and

1199
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,000
see all of their clinical lab values

1200
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,559
over the last 10 years. And so what this

1201
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,720
creates for us is a data resource that

1202
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:09,680
we've added genomes to, but is primarily

1203
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:13,119
powered by the fact that we have nearly

1204
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,200
on a on the order of 1,000 clinical

1205
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,559
medical data points per individual,

1206
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,640
including all of their prescription

1207
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,760
medications that have ever been filled,

1208
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:25,160
all of their procedures, um, primary

1209
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:28,240
care, tertiary care, etc.

1210
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:29,920
Um, on top of the discoveries in human

1211
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,359
genetics, you might ask, what's the

1212
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,839
value addition to if we already found a

1213
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:38,319
500 genes for IBD and 500 genes for

1214
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:40,800
schizophrenia, what's the value add?

1215
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:43,680
There's the longitudinal aspect. As I

1216
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,640
said, this data goes back 50 years. and

1217
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,040
human genetics approaches have really

1218
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:51,839
not been concerned with what are really

1219
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,599
the primary drivers of interest in the

1220
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:55,839
pharmaceutical industry which is

1221
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,920
stopping disease over time after it

1222
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:58,839
already starts not simply not predicting

1223
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,960
it in

1224
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:03,400
advance. There are a huge number of

1225
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,240
undeser underserved diseases and

1226
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,559
populations that need great attention.

1227
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:10,720
And as you can imagine, those that have

1228
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,960
not been funded are generally in

1229
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,880
underserved populations or having to do

1230
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,960
with women's and reproductive health and

1231
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,319
many other topics that just haven't been

1232
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:23,280
popular for funding. Um, but there's

1233
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:25,280
many more opportunities and needs for

1234
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,000
the follow-up work after discovery that

1235
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,680
I think bioanks can serve. But the one

1236
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,119
that I wanted to point out that I think

1237
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:34,800
is a great opportunity for AI and ML

1238
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:38,240
approaches is exemplified on this

1239
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:41,200
picture. Each dot here represents a

1240
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:44,400
clinical data point, a diagnosis, a

1241
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,960
prescription medication, a procedure.

1242
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:52,000
And these are two men, both alive today,

1243
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:54,240
both age 80. And we can see visually

1244
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,559
here what is a definition of healthy

1245
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,800
aging. And this is I think when people

1246
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,200
talk about studying aging and studying

1247
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:04,000
you know healthy aging and so forth what

1248
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,640
they have in mind is the person on the

1249
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,480
far side of the screen who has up until

1250
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:13,040
about age 75 had no medical procedures

1251
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,800
or any contact with the medicali system

1252
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,200
outside of getting prescribed

1253
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,440
antibiotics a few times as opposed to

1254
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:23,359
the individual on the right. And so our

1255
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,359
studies of aging and longevity can and

1256
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:28,520
must go much further than simply

1257
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:31,599
assessing how long did everybody

1258
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:33,440
live. So where do we go from here? I

1259
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,079
want to highlight a few exciting things

1260
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,200
that might help us begin to fill the

1261
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:40,800
huge gap between massive discovery of

1262
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,520
thousands or tens of thousands of

1263
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:47,400
variants and very few new therapeutic

1264
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,400
concepts that come through.

1265
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:52,760
Basically, cut a long story short,

1266
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,440
discovery of genetic variants is pretty

1267
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,440
straightforward compared to interpreting

1268
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:01,119
what those tell us about the biology of

1269
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,559
disease and how we might reverse it. So,

1270
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,920
we'd like to be able to move

1271
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:08,079
systematically from point A to point B.

1272
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,640
But how do we do it? And so the first

1273
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,640
step is I've told you that you know

1274
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,480
we've essentially solved genetic

1275
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:16,720
discovery that there are literally tens

1276
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:19,119
of thousands of gene variants associated

1277
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,800
to disease. So step one you might ask

1278
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,839
where do I go to tap into all this

1279
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,680
wonderful data and the problem is you

1280
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,760
reach quickly reach the conclusion that

1281
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:30,240
it's massively siloed and that actually

1282
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,040
nobody has put together the data from

1283
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:36,720
all of these diverse sources of insights

1284
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:40,040
all of which could be valuably deployed.

1285
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:43,680
um and and assessed with

1286
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:45,839
AI. So such a catalog could be in

1287
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,079
principle incredibly powerful. We could

1288
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:50,319
learn from protein structure. We could

1289
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,920
learn from the plyotropy across many

1290
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:53,280
diseases of where there are variants

1291
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,280
that are shared. And I'll give you a few

1292
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,280
examples of those. But that just really

1293
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,760
begins to scratch the surface into what

1294
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,839
we could do if we really computationally

1295
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,200
apply ourselves to everything that's

1296
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:08,200
been discovered thus far. Um, one way to

1297
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,720
do that is to tap into the unique

1298
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:14,319
opportunity that happens over and over

1299
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:16,400
in the genome where distinct single

1300
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:19,760
genetic variants influence multiple

1301
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:22,480
diseases and many of them group together

1302
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,480
to influence multiple diseases. And that

1303
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:27,520
gives us a little bit of an insight when

1304
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:31,359
you think about it into

1305
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:34,720
um the potential for exposing and

1306
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:38,000
understanding potentials. the shared

1307
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:41,680
mechanisms between diseases and grouping

1308
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,599
distinct mechanisms within a disease. So

1309
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,359
study of gestational diabetes, we

1310
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,280
realized when we were building the finen

1311
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,000
resource that all of a sudden somebody

1312
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,920
woke up one day and said we have a data

1313
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,680
set to study gestational diabetes that's

1314
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,040
twice as large as the world's largest

1315
00:53:53,680 --> 00:54:00,640
publication to date. So they did that um

1316
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,800
and discovered with you know simple good

1317
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:06,319
oldfashioned basian statistics that

1318
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:09,440
there were actually two distinct um

1319
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:11,040
modes of genetic variant associations to

1320
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,040
type 2 diabetes in the general

1321
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,200
population and gestational diabetes

1322
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,680
separately. One of them that was

1323
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:20,640
predominantly or uniquely affecting

1324
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:23,839
gestational diabetes.

1325
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:26,640
different example. Um when we started

1326
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:29,440
looking into um as we often do

1327
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,760
autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, we

1328
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,400
stumbled across the observation that

1329
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,400
autoimmune hypothyroidism and skin

1330
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,200
cancer shared an enormous number of

1331
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,920
associations. Almost 10% of the variants

1332
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,760
associated to hypothyroidism were

1333
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,000
associated to skin cancer, but nearly

1334
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,520
all of them in the opposite direction.

1335
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,839
So what was causing risk for

1336
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,000
autoimmunity was protecting against skin

1337
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:55,599
cancer. And as it turns out, what was

1338
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,480
being uncovered here was simply the

1339
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:01,319
signature of what at at a low level in

1340
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:05,119
the population of what

1341
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:07,200
um the immune immunotherapies in cancers

1342
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,960
are actually doing. And in fact, the

1343
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:12,079
same genes are at play in this

1344
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,000
signature. And you can strongly see that

1345
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,880
genetics, if we didn't already know it

1346
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,599
from the success of imunotherapies,

1347
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,599
support strongly the idea that increased

1348
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,319
levels of immune surveillance put you at

1349
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:27,319
risk of autoimmunity but protect you

1350
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:30,240
from cancer.

1351
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:33,440
So quickly in the last you know few

1352
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,200
examples um we have another challenge

1353
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,880
and just shifting gears for a moment

1354
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,440
that's in a you know I think a pretty

1355
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,200
interesting area um that we haven't

1356
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,800
really gotten much out of the rare

1357
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,240
genetic variants that we've been

1358
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,400
identifying in all these sequencing

1359
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:50,240
studies um because every time you might

1360
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,160
encounter one variant that causes a

1361
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:54,160
disease there are many many around it

1362
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:57,280
that are rare and simply neutral in the

1363
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,440
background and so What Hillary Finane

1364
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:03,119
and Share Gerggas and others in

1365
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:05,680
Hillary's group have taken on is the

1366
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:08,880
idea that we might map our case control

1367
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,760
data onto protein structure and get much

1368
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,799
further with identifying not only what

1369
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:18,319
the genes are relevant to rare diseases

1370
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:20,559
but also importantly figuring out what

1371
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:22,480
mechanisms might be at play. They did

1372
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:25,559
this in the case of one particular

1373
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:28,400
plasma membrane calcium transporter in

1374
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:30,000
schizophrenia that had a relatively

1375
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,960
interesting but not convincing

1376
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,559
association with 66 rare variants in

1377
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:39,520
cases and 191 seen in

1378
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:42,079
controls. However, when structurally

1379
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,160
mapping these variants, you could see

1380
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,720
highly significant evidence that they

1381
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:50,319
cluster in one or two neighborhoods in

1382
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:54,079
the gene. in fact pointing directly to

1383
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:58,400
the location where the calcium ion binds

1384
00:56:54,079 --> 00:57:00,720
in the transporting process.

1385
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,119
So finally just in closing the main

1386
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,200
challenge we really then look forward to

1387
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:08,400
is how do we move beyond simply

1388
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:11,760
discovery but inferring mechanism from

1389
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:13,359
experimental work and just to highlight

1390
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,720
the last place where I think there's

1391
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:20,480
huge opportunity in integration of data

1392
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:22,319
across these modalities um cell atlases

1393
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,680
and especially disease relevant cell

1394
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:25,760
atlases and I'm sure you're aware of

1395
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,839
some of these exciting papers that have

1396
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:31,200
been published in recent I think create

1397
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:34,079
a great opportunity and so we've been

1398
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:37,040
expanding on this concept to link not

1399
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:40,000
only you know these cell atlases you

1400
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:42,640
know do them at a at a higher scale but

1401
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,440
also do them in individuals that are

1402
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:48,559
from the finen resource and have full

1403
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:51,119
profiling available to them and so in

1404
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:54,079
doing this Masakana in Romnik Xavier's

1405
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:56,880
lab has developed a resource not only

1406
00:57:54,079 --> 00:58:01,280
that has on the order of a 100,000 and

1407
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:03,680
eqls in PBMC's and 100,000 um chromatin

1408
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,000
accessibility QTLs but can connect these

1409
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,839
also to the life history and clinical

1410
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,400
history and those thousand data points

1411
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:14,160
per person in each of those individuals.

1412
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:17,359
So I will close there and just leave a

1413
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:19,440
few thoughts where I think large data

1414
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:23,400
sets are being developed in the space of

1415
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:27,200
the human organism and the DNA that

1416
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:29,920
definitely can be benefit from and are

1417
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,480
seriously undermined right now with

1418
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:36,839
respect to what could be obtained

1419
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,839
through AI and ML approaches.

1420
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:43,769
[Applause]

1421
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:54,480
Thank you Mark. Um yeah, amazing what

1422
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:57,440
what uh one can do from turning the

1423
00:58:54,480 --> 00:59:00,240
uh the whole health care system into a

1424
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,880
learning system. Um someday we'll do

1425
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,599
this in the United States as well. Would

1426
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,119
that be cool?

1427
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:10,480
Ye of little

1428
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:13,559
faith. All right. Can I invite our

1429
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:16,920
speakers up to the table

1430
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:19,920
and I'm going to ask them first

1431
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:22,240
to ask questions of each other and then

1432
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,799
you all will jump in and I might ask

1433
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,799
questions occasionally. You never know.

1434
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:39,319
Um okay. Pick any

1435
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:43,280
order. So, what do you want to

1436
00:59:39,319 --> 00:59:46,160
know? What do you want to say?

1437
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,720
Does this work? Does it work? Testing.

1438
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,799
Say, does it work? Maybe just start. Um,

1439
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,480
can you hear him? Can I Can you hear us

1440
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:54,079
at the back all the way? Yeah, you got

1441
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,680
to talk like right into the microphone.

1442
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:59,040
Right into it. Okay. I'll I'll I'll try

1443
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:01,680
to be like Eric. All right. Uh I will u

1444
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:04,720
I'll probably start with um just asking

1445
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:05,920
you all as to and Mark you you alluded

1446
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,160
to this towards the end but I couldn't

1447
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,160
capture it all as as to what problem in

1448
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,640
your fields do you think are at the

1449
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:16,200
brink of being solved and you have the

1450
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:19,119
data for it uh but what it needs is

1451
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:21,119
probably AI methods to solve it. I I use

1452
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:23,040
AI very grudgingly because I I don't

1453
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:26,000
like that term but you know things that

1454
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:30,040
are complicated too late now. Yeah. Um

1455
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,040
so that that's a broad question.

1456
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:35,760
That is a broad question. Um you know I

1457
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,319
think what we're trying to do is you

1458
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,440
know

1459
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:43,280
identify you know the mechanisms of

1460
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:47,599
disease so that we can ultimately

1461
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:50,640
reverse them. I think you know the the

1462
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:53,599
potential integration across OMIX

1463
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:55,839
modalities with the DNA and with the

1464
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:59,119
health history offers us a great

1465
01:00:55,839 --> 01:01:00,799
opportunity for that but we are not

1466
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,200
close to the computational approaches

1467
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:05,680
that would need

1468
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:08,160
to really learn from that. So what do

1469
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:10,799
you need

1470
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,720
a lot of smart people to you know

1471
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:15,359
aggregate all the data and then start

1472
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:20,000
working on it. I think I mean the data

1473
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:21,520
is you know falling into place

1474
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,359
don't see that as such a limitation

1475
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:26,000
right now right so you're aggregating

1476
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:30,079
the data even you know slowly wrangling

1477
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:34,359
all this stuff and so computational

1478
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:39,359
methods what do we need so can I ask

1479
01:01:34,359 --> 01:01:43,079
follow question a bit AI gets used in in

1480
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:47,520
different ways there's

1481
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:49,839
is foundational models that are, you

1482
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:52,200
know, throw everything in and stir and

1483
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:54,559
do an excellent job of predicting

1484
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:56,240
something. And then there's I'm

1485
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,000
caricatururing, guys. I'm just

1486
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,559
caricaturing, forgive me. And then

1487
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,040
there's kind of like building up

1488
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:05,119
particular mechanistic things. How much

1489
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:08,680
do we need of each of those for getting

1490
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:08,680
this into medicine?

1491
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:17,200
I'm not sure. I Well, I mean, basically,

1492
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,359
so we need a lot more of the latter.

1493
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,359
Which was the latter?

1494
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:23,680
Building up mechanisms. So, you want

1495
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:26,079
things that build up mechanisms rather

1496
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:29,520
than make predictions. Yeah. And the and

1497
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:34,480
the assertion that I would make is that

1498
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:37,280
we have glimpses of that when we look

1499
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:40,880
across diseases. We have glimpses of

1500
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:44,960
that when we look across, you know,

1501
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:46,640
associations in the single cell data.

1502
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,960
And we have glimpses of it in a couple

1503
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,280
of other of these dimensions, but

1504
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,359
nothing that's putting together the full

1505
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,920
picture in a way that's internally

1506
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:58,240
consistent and that would convince you

1507
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:01,359
that this and this and this are actually

1508
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:04,720
mechanisms of disease.

1509
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:06,960
Good. Keep asking each other questions.

1510
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:10,640
I was really I I was telling Hillary

1511
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:13,200
also that I'm just so impressed by

1512
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:16,160
um oh I I I'm just so impressed by we

1513
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:18,559
are impressed Hillary by um you know

1514
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:21,200
this idea of enriching the rare

1515
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:22,359
misssense varants onto the structure of

1516
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,039
of

1517
01:03:22,359 --> 01:03:27,200
proteins and actually I'm just impressed

1518
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:29,119
by how much information there is in

1519
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,359
these language model protein language

1520
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:34,720
model embeddings and so so I'm just

1521
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:37,119
curious about you know How do you think

1522
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:39,440
we'll be able to get

1523
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:41,920
um do you think we need to collect more

1524
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,960
rare variant data where it's not even

1525
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,559
associated necessarily with disease

1526
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,200
phenotypes in that way like you know

1527
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:51,839
Shant um Shantu showed like these

1528
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,599
imaging phenotypes of varants like can

1529
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:55,760
we use that sort of thing to discover

1530
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:59,680
the functions of prote mechanisms of

1531
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:01,599
proteins more systematically in a way um

1532
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,280
that's not just about I mean I I don't

1533
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,440
want to say that's not just about G-W

1534
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:08,440
was but you know in a way that's more

1535
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,440
generalizable.

1536
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,039
I'm afraid that's a human genetics

1537
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,119
question.

1538
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:18,240
So I think I think and so if we look at

1539
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:21,680
the human population and we ask where do

1540
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:26,319
rare varants occur or not occur and we

1541
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:28,880
had I don't know 100 million people how

1542
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:31,920
far would we go? So you think about

1543
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:34,720
things like the Nomad database. Tell us

1544
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:38,640
you know what can we learn by looking?

1545
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:41,119
So yeah we're we have you know on the

1546
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,880
order of a million to a few million

1547
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:47,760
genomes sequenced and I think we can do

1548
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:50,720
a lot of that already. I think when we,

1549
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,839
you know, what we get to with those

1550
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:55,559
analyses are, you know, identification

1551
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:58,400
of

1552
01:04:55,559 --> 01:05:01,039
specific domains, specific structural

1553
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:02,640
elements where mutation is not

1554
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:06,319
tolerated.

1555
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:08,960
That's not the be all end all of human

1556
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:13,680
disease because you know obviously

1557
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:17,440
there's a great many diseases that don't

1558
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:20,319
really have that delletterious a effect

1559
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,799
on reproductive fitness and we're

1560
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:25,280
interested in those just as well. So,

1561
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:28,400
but you can certainly learn a lot from

1562
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:32,960
that. I think where we can also is just

1563
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:34,960
by looking at these patterns of limited

1564
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:38,640
variation whether it's structure based

1565
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:40,640
or or what have you across proteins with

1566
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:44,960
similar structures and that's going to

1567
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:47,280
help us you know further zero in on the

1568
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,200
particular functional elements that are

1569
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,200
right. So you actually you think you can

1570
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,680
aggregate misssense mut you think you

1571
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,599
can aggregate misssense

1572
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:58,839
mutations around proteins with similar

1573
01:05:55,599 --> 01:06:02,559
structures? We know we can done this you

1574
01:05:58,839 --> 01:06:04,240
know ago with you know simple examples

1575
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,720
like sodium channels and calcium

1576
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:09,039
channels and so forth.

1577
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,280
Right. Right. So human genetics is the

1578
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:13,039
kind of mutational screens you want to

1579
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:16,839
do because it's it's off doing it

1580
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:20,680
anyway. Can I ask you guys about the

1581
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:24,480
tissues projecting forward 10 years from

1582
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,480
now? Where are we going to

1583
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:30,079
be? You know, you can talk either

1584
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:32,799
methodologically, you could talk about

1585
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:34,720
the reach of it, you can talk about its

1586
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:36,640
uses in clinical medicine. Where are we

1587
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:39,839
going to be?

1588
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:42,160
Actually all of those are uh I think

1589
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:44,559
very interesting directions but I was

1590
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:47,680
going I I want to pivot this a little

1591
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:51,280
bit to to to my observation today

1592
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:53,920
towards predictive uh models and so on

1593
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:57,280
that I see today. You know you can and

1594
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:59,760
identify a missing you know a a gap. So

1595
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:02,240
you see a lot of this foundation model

1596
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,240
or deep learning models that helped so

1597
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:06,559
much in towards the structural

1598
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:08,559
prediction of protein and so on. And

1599
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,640
then you see the foundation models in

1600
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:12,319
terms of describing cell states and so

1601
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:15,680
on. But then when describing the cell

1602
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:18,240
states it's more of like a a molecule

1603
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:21,599
list of the cell right you know a vector

1604
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:23,839
of pro profiling and so on. But the cell

1605
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:26,559
is not just a list of things of which

1606
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:28,000
genes expressed or not. It's like a

1607
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:30,000
structure, you know, it's a lot of

1608
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,920
interaction networks and so on. And when

1609
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,280
it gets to tissue, it's the same. It's a

1610
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,599
network. I mean, it's getting to a

1611
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,480
little bit of your question. It's a ne

1612
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:41,839
network of cells that interact. At that

1613
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:44,960
level, you see a lot less of this

1614
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:48,400
predictive uh powerful deep learning

1615
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:50,720
model going towards that direction.

1616
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,799
Although if you think about it uh you

1617
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:55,920
know at the protein structure level, it

1618
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:58,799
is a structure model. But then at the

1619
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:01,119
cell level and tissue level it's more of

1620
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:03,280
a list model rather than a structure

1621
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:05,599
model and those structure interactions

1622
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,839
are very important for you know

1623
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:09,920
understanding eventually the mechanisms.

1624
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:11,920
No, I don't know whether for curing

1625
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,400
diseases because sometimes you find out

1626
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,960
the mutation and then you can do you

1627
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:19,199
know maybe eventually the gene editing

1628
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,159
kind of therapy and so on but for a lot

1629
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:25,679
of us who are uh curiositydriven for

1630
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:27,839
understanding biology deeply we do want

1631
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,839
this kind of a level of mechanistic

1632
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:31,520
understanding that has the molecu

1633
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:33,839
molecule interaction the network the

1634
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,719
salo interaction network. So how do

1635
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:40,880
computation and AI help on that

1636
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:42,880
direction is something that bothers me

1637
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,560
daily now you know when when I keep

1638
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:47,199
thinking about these large predictive

1639
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:49,600
models in that direction.

1640
01:08:47,199 --> 01:08:53,120
FA yeah I I just wanted to add that

1641
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:55,440
protein protein interactions are are

1642
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,560
something that is you know both bridges

1643
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:59,839
this well maybe we can use misssense

1644
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:01,120
varants actually in human genetics study

1645
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:03,279
protein protein interactions but maybe

1646
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,640
we can also use spatial genomics study

1647
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,159
protein protein interactions and

1648
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,080
something that's actually very

1649
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:11,920
mechanistically powerful and also

1650
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:13,920
missing from our data actually um maybe

1651
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,400
I'll just ask answer Eric's question

1652
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,400
more directly oh good I was going to

1653
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:20,319
come back to it anyway. So, go for it.

1654
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:22,880
Well, I I I I I think that, you know, a

1655
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:27,759
lot of us believe uh that we're going to

1656
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:30,480
be able to systematically collect the

1657
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:33,359
comprehensive catalog of cellular

1658
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:38,159
programs, which are gene modules that

1659
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:41,279
cells use to define their function and

1660
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:42,880
their states and their types. And how

1661
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,400
are we going to do that? Well, we'll

1662
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,839
probably actually right now we're trying

1663
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,920
to do that in single cell, but I think

1664
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:50,560
we'll probably what we'll do is we'll

1665
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:53,040
learn it completely from spatial data

1666
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:57,360
because you know there's most cell types

1667
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:57,360
in the body you can't dissociate

1668
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:07,840
eased by the interactions of of the

1669
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,239
cells and

1670
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,840
um and that's going to be I think quite

1671
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:16,640
quite a powerful way to repres represent

1672
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:18,239
biology where you you have your programs

1673
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,960
and then you have some way of just

1674
01:10:18,239 --> 01:10:23,040
saying like a tissue you know is

1675
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,120
composed of cells of these types and

1676
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,159
they act have these programs and they

1677
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,159
communicate with each other through

1678
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:29,440
these modules and that's how they change

1679
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:31,760
change the programs that they're

1680
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:33,760
undergoing and then that's the base case

1681
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,719
for health and then you can start using

1682
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:39,199
that for all of disease so it's just

1683
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:41,199
like I think we're not that far actually

1684
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:44,360
from collecting that data and generating

1685
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:48,239
that sort of analysis.

1686
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:50,400
Um, that's basic research. But I think

1687
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:53,239
there's probably also some a lot of like

1688
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:55,920
clinical translation of of the spatial

1689
01:10:53,239 --> 01:10:57,520
data because especially in the

1690
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,760
integration with like hisystologology

1691
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:02,880
models because

1692
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:04,719
um it might be really challenging to

1693
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,080
collect and I think it will remain

1694
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,640
challenging to collect spatial

1695
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:11,360
transcripttoics data in the clinic

1696
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:14,960
because from what you know I visited MGH

1697
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:16,400
pathology and they were like you know

1698
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,480
it's been 20 years since we started

1699
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,560
collecting fluorescent IHC but we can't

1700
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,480
convince the clinicians to routinely

1701
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:25,000
collect it all the time or something and

1702
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:28,000
so I think there's just a lot of

1703
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:30,159
ingrained method methodology but you

1704
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:33,520
know that's a place where ML can really

1705
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:36,480
take these images and transfer the

1706
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:38,320
learnings about like molecules onto

1707
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:39,679
those images and that's something that's

1708
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,280
quite exciting and we don't have to

1709
01:11:39,679 --> 01:11:44,159
change anything about how clinical

1710
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:45,920
practice is done that's well okay it is

1711
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:47,120
sometimes worth changing clinical

1712
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,920
practice practice by the way. Well,

1713
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:52,320
maybe we can do it in 10 years. Maybe 10

1714
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:57,360
years is hard. Although I I note the

1715
01:11:52,320 --> 01:12:00,560
resistance of cancer uh specialists in

1716
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,560
looking at gene mutations. There was a

1717
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,560
time that they were they didn't want to

1718
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,280
do any of that sequencing. Then they

1719
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:10,679
felt you should do 20 genes, then a

1720
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:14,000
panel of 300 genes, then okay, a whole

1721
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:16,560
exo, and now whole genomes. And

1722
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,960
eventually as we see it's valuable one

1723
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:21,960
can change it but okay so so maybe

1724
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,719
they're not going to do it immediately.

1725
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:28,120
Um

1726
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:30,719
still how far can we go from taking

1727
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:33,640
ordinary images collected in the course

1728
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:36,640
of pathology and

1729
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:39,920
reconstructing the entire transcriptto

1730
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:42,800
or proteome or whatever. How sanguin or

1731
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:45,679
say the three of you from the jump

1732
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:49,320
consortium and from the things you do

1733
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:49,320
we'll start with you Shantu

1734
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:55,800
how much is in that image so

1735
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:59,840
amongst gene

1736
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:03,440
expression maybe new gene transcription

1737
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:05,199
chromatin structure and protein levels

1738
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,600
can I reconstruct all that by just

1739
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:08,600
looking part.

1740
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:14,080
So I I don't know about those specific

1741
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,600
things. I just made this up but I mean

1742
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:17,600
just answer whatever you want but but

1743
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,440
but in general uh the way I've been

1744
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,080
viewing uh viewing imaging and that's

1745
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,520
why I use the term uncanny uh because

1746
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:26,239
you know when you look at those images

1747
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:28,080
it's very hard to believe that you know

1748
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:29,560
those images contain enough information

1749
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:32,000
for you to be able to

1750
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:33,920
recapitulate pathways be able to find

1751
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,800
mechanism of action of drugs be able to

1752
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,480
predict other readouts and it is still

1753
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,679
uncanny to me every time it happens

1754
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,280
although I've been doing this for 15

1755
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:43,360
years right so I I don't know it's

1756
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,640
possible I think It's I mean especially

1757
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,640
the the examples that you gave

1758
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:50,880
specifically are possible but I think in

1759
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:52,000
in general um you know sort of combine

1760
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,880
the two questions you asked the one you

1761
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,440
asked me and the one you asked Feyen uh

1762
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:00,400
is that I think uh what we will see in

1763
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:03,600
the next 10 years along these lines is

1764
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:06,719
that we will hopefully start doing

1765
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,600
things uh we we'll start doing the

1766
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,920
things that we doing right now but

1767
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:15,280
cheaper powered by predictive methods.

1768
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:17,600
methods in the sense that we will have a

1769
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,040
lot of data that is expensive to collect

1770
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,719
and we've been collecting it right now

1771
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,560
and then we'll have a lot of data that

1772
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,320
is cheap to collect. I'm giving the

1773
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:26,239
example of histologology for example and

1774
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:28,239
and and anything downstream and I think

1775
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:29,920
you'll be able to do increasingly better

1776
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:32,480
job of being able to predict the

1777
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,760
expensive stuff and this is really the

1778
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,840
benefit of any supervised learning

1779
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:38,239
technique right uh so for example we're

1780
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:40,320
already seeing that in our field of

1781
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:41,840
image based profiling where uh we we

1782
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:44,000
stain you know cell the cell painting

1783
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,840
die set is fairly standard now in the

1784
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,440
field uh but I don't think it will be

1785
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:49,440
used in five years I I think in five

1786
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:51,840
years we will only need to collect

1787
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:53,600
bright field images and companies is

1788
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,480
already doing this and just be able to p

1789
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:59,600
predict those five stains for example

1790
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:01,199
dramatically reduces your cost. Um but

1791
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:03,280
also scales things up allows you to do

1792
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:05,280
live cell imaging and things like that.

1793
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:07,120
Um I'm trying to get back to the the

1794
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:10,000
main question that asked me I I think

1795
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:11,920
you you can predict a lot of complex

1796
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,080
things. We there's this whole could get

1797
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,000
into it but one sort of direction in

1798
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,679
which our field takes this work is is

1799
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,480
predicting complex assays. being able to

1800
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:23,280
predict uh the the outcome on a zebra

1801
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:26,239
fish screen using using cell painting

1802
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:29,040
images of cells in a very specific uh

1803
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:30,880
lung abnor cell right who would say

1804
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,080
there's any correlation I can't say

1805
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:35,280
there's a correlation by looking at

1806
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:37,440
those cells but given enough data and

1807
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:39,600
careful training we seem to be able to

1808
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:42,000
do that so I'm very optimistic about it

1809
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,360
very optimistic about it cautiously so

1810
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,480
and which is why I'm sort of looking to

1811
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:49,360
the ML community to tell us you know how

1812
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:52,520
do we do do this uh more in a more

1813
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:56,880
principled way in a more uh in a more

1814
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:58,159
um with with more harnesses um and uh I

1815
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:01,360
I'll stop there probably come back to

1816
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:04,159
this thread but show yeah so I I think

1817
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:06,960
the verdicts is out but there's more and

1818
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:09,679
more data in terms of the joint data in

1819
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:12,800
the same sample that has both

1820
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:15,600
hisystologology and imunofllororesence

1821
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:18,000
and uh sort of a transcriptto kind of a

1822
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,480
data and then We've tried a little bit

1823
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,640
uh and I mean the kind of data that we

1824
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,880
have perhaps is not large enough and

1825
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:27,040
then we did find that for example with

1826
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:30,000
the last bit that I showed that we

1827
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:32,400
weren't able to predict the cell state

1828
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,239
with the you know 20 kind of protein

1829
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,880
labels and so on but that doesn't mean

1830
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:39,600
ultimately you know with enough of label

1831
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:41,760
you cannot but with a large amount of

1832
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,840
label then you also start to wonder is

1833
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,480
that a cheaper way because the

1834
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:49,040
transcrytoics imaging is not necessarily

1835
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:51,120
as it keeps scaling not not going to be

1836
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,520
cheaper than the protein imaging but

1837
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:57,199
what I like is the connection of them

1838
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:59,920
whether it is a way to predict with a

1839
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:02,719
cheaper approach it is a connection that

1840
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:05,120
at least for understanding biology we

1841
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:07,360
have to build you know between the trans

1842
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:10,080
you know the the molecular programs and

1843
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:12,159
the the morphology and the you know the

1844
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:14,400
protein the dynamics the network and so

1845
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:16,400
on just even for the fundamental

1846
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:19,120
understanding of biology which of course

1847
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:21,600
eventually will lead to benefit in

1848
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:24,159
medicine. So that kind of a connection

1849
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:26,159
is going to sooner or later be built. I

1850
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:28,239
mean that's why we spent so much time

1851
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:30,960
working on imaging you know both

1852
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:35,920
modalities and so on. We should let some

1853
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:39,199
more folks into the conversation. Yes,

1854
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,800
I shouldn't throw that.

1855
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,719
Yeah, but you could shout. I think

1856
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,800
they'll hear you. No, talk to the

1857
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,640
microphone. I'm loud enough. generally

1858
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,640
loud enough they won't hear you on the

1859
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:51,600
internet. Yeah, it it's a fantastic

1860
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:53,199
conversation. I just

1861
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,640
we were talking you I think Mark was

1862
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:56,719
talking about like there's a lot of data

1863
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:59,679
and we can aggregate it now. I think

1864
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:02,080
that's partly true and it's also not

1865
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,600
true in really critical ways. So if you

1866
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,600
look at where foundation models and

1867
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,440
large models have been showing a bit of

1868
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:10,000
promise, it's generally on data that

1869
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:12,480
does aggregate. So sequences for DNA or

1870
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,480
for proteins and things like um atomic

1871
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:17,360
distances for structure. when you look

1872
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:19,120
at stuff like expression data, it's a

1873
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,880
nightmare to train a model on it doesn't

1874
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:24,159
aggregate well. It's still full of batch

1875
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:26,239
effects, you know. So, um or and what

1876
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:28,000
ends up happening is like Jiao was

1877
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:29,440
saying, you just dumb down the task that

1878
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,280
you're asking the model to do to a point

1879
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:34,080
whereby it kind of works, but then it's

1880
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:36,000
not much use for anything. So, like how

1881
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:38,560
do we get to the point? So, a am I

1882
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,800
please tell me I'm wrong and b like if

1883
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,560
I'm not, what do we do to address that?

1884
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,719
Because that to me feels like a major

1885
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,560
blocker. We need to have a global effort

1886
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:48,480
to aggregate data that is consistent

1887
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:52,080
enough to train large models and it

1888
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:53,440
doesn't feel like we're doing it yet.

1889
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,280
Actually, I don't think you're wrong.

1890
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:57,280
Actually, I think you're right on

1891
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:59,440
target. I mean, whole organism data,

1892
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:02,239
especially human data, is messy. I mean

1893
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:04,719
we're dealing with real world data and

1894
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:09,120
on the clinical side and then even on

1895
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:12,280
the biopecimen and and transcryto side

1896
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:15,040
proteome side there's a huge amount of

1897
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:17,040
variability. The proteome especially is

1898
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:19,679
incredibly sensitive to environments

1899
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:23,199
like 10 times more than it is respon

1900
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:25,920
responsive to what's in your genome. So

1901
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:27,920
it will take you know a considerable

1902
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:30,480
effort I think just to have technical

1903
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:33,440
compatibility across studies around the

1904
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:37,040
world. So not a task to be overlooked. I

1905
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:39,679
think it it's worth noting that sequence

1906
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:42,400
didn't used to look so good either. It

1907
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:45,920
took an awful lot of quality control

1908
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:48,239
before sequence became combinable across

1909
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,960
places. All the genome centers in the

1910
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:53,520
human genome project just hated doing

1911
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,360
the roundrobin quality controls because

1912
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:57,679
it showed that you had mistakes and you

1913
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:59,679
had other things. It's possible that

1914
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:04,159
what's needed and maybe you should help

1915
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:06,640
drive it is to say that anybody who's

1916
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:09,360
developing new methods should be running

1917
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:11,679
you know data sets that are in parallel

1918
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:14,159
being you can ask can I properly

1919
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:16,000
translate this from method A to method

1920
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:19,120
B. I don't have to do it identically,

1921
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,880
but I need a very good translation. And

1922
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:23,440
people should not be allowed to publish

1923
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,840
data without the ability to do that. And

1924
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:28,480
that's a lot of computational work to to

1925
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:32,080
sort of validate that this can be

1926
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:33,600
translated from one to another rather

1927
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,800
than just later, you know, saying it's

1928
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,920
batch effects. We got to have the

1929
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:41,520
internal controls within it that tell

1930
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:43,440
you how to correct inherent in it. So,

1931
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,679
make that happen. Yes. Next question. Uh

1932
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:47,840
I I have a comment on on the question.

1933
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:50,560
Oh please. Yes. So I actually think this

1934
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:53,679
aggregation being able to put together

1935
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:56,400
all kinds of data that has batch effect

1936
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,880
is a very important computational method

1937
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:01,679
and there are ways that one could

1938
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:05,440
envision to do that. It's not impossible

1939
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:08,400
and it will be very important as a

1940
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:10,640
success. Uh but just be mindful while

1941
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:13,440
doing that. There are technical art you

1942
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:15,920
know batch artifacts and so on but some

1943
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:18,600
of those are also true biological

1944
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:21,280
variations because of the conditional

1945
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:24,080
differences. So when the aggregation

1946
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:27,199
power is too strong in the computational

1947
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:29,800
power it can also cause the loss of some

1948
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:32,159
of those actually important biological

1949
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:35,040
variations. So a balance between that

1950
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:37,360
but I do think it's a uh it's a good

1951
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,600
computational problem. Of course, as

1952
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:42,480
experimentalists ourselves, so we will

1953
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,320
try to standardize and remove this. But

1954
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:48,560
it is a very interesting and

1955
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:51,040
intellectually uh uh important challenge

1956
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:54,239
to overcome. We have a question over

1957
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:56,239
here. Hi, thank you for your talk. So my

1958
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:59,440
question is related to what have you

1959
01:21:56,239 --> 01:22:02,480
have seen the said a few minutes about

1960
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:06,239
the qual the quality of the data and I

1961
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:08,000
am no machine learning scientist. So

1962
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:10,239
everything today was really really new

1963
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:13,040
news for me. But I am a super resolution

1964
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:16,239
microscopy scientist. So I try to see

1965
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:19,360
this the things from from the inside to

1966
01:22:16,239 --> 01:22:22,960
the nanoscopic level to the outside. And

1967
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:26,000
there are I have there there are another

1968
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:31,199
ways to try to simulate the biological

1969
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:34,239
data but it requires a lot of curation.

1970
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:35,159
B based on my context, I I see that all

1971
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:39,760
your

1972
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:42,719
methods it looks like you input as a

1973
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:46,719
after after you finalize the the the

1974
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:49,480
analysis. But how about curation before

1975
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:52,000
using that data for

1976
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:55,120
the for the input of the machine

1977
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,560
learning methods? Let let me add you two

1978
01:22:55,120 --> 01:23:02,320
more things. Um in the case of uh FA

1979
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:07,080
there's a new paper about the antibbody

1980
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:10,960
of transumap the for for can breast

1981
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:13,440
cancer cell about that the way it it

1982
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:17,440
works it's it was it's not about

1983
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:20,239
blocking the receptor but generating a

1984
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:22,840
second uh response. So, so that kind of

1985
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:28,040
things will be

1986
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:30,320
really diff um maybe they can

1987
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:32,880
be I'm very Why don't we give the

1988
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:36,159
question to Fay? Yeah,

1989
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:38,880
you seem to be No, I I I have three. May

1990
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:41,040
I finish my three because I think one

1991
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,400
one is mine. I think I think maybe

1992
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,719
you're you're saying maybe the data

1993
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:47,600
needs to be curated before it goes into

1994
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:49,199
ML algorithms but I I I think I think

1995
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,040
the community actually spends a lot of

1996
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:52,960
time

1997
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:56,520
curating certainly actually all of our

1998
01:23:52,960 --> 01:24:00,159
data transcriptto data or imaging data

1999
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:03,360
um you know there's certainly in single

2000
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:05,120
cell you know I think people it's become

2001
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:07,120
more mature although we can still argue

2002
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:09,360
about how much curation is being done uh

2003
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:12,080
as we pull data sets but one nice thing

2004
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:14,000
is is that all of the data in our

2005
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:16,480
community is actually downloadable

2006
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:21,080
whether it's spatial or single cell or

2007
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:24,639
anything. And so um people are

2008
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:28,880
constantly revisiting this task of data

2009
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:30,880
curation and data integration actually

2010
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,400
speaking to Lindsay. So so I do think it

2011
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:34,800
is a problem that people are aware of

2012
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:37,040
and we're we're doing it. It's just not

2013
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,320
that sexy I guess. So maybe there's

2014
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:40,120
maybe more people should be doing it

2015
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:42,159
than they are

2016
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:44,400
already tools should be doing it or

2017
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:47,760
maybe AI tools should be doing it. Yeah.

2018
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:49,600
So, you know, a lot of the algorithms I

2019
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,520
see out there and, you know, um

2020
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,960
sometimes guilty as charged is people

2021
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,920
say, "Oh, here's something that the

2022
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,520
machine learning community, you know,

2023
01:24:54,920 --> 01:25:00,000
developed, you know, transformer,

2024
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:03,280
whatever. We're going to plug it as is,

2025
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,360
you know, some chat GPT or or whatever

2026
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:07,199
directly on biological data because it

2027
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:09,120
sort of mapped this that to the other."

2028
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:11,199
But actually if we look and everyone you

2029
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:14,239
know uses AlphaFold look the LLM worked

2030
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:15,600
but actually in in Alphafold uh it you

2031
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:17,679
know it wasn't out of the box they

2032
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:20,400
actually took evolutionary conservation

2033
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:22,480
and that was a major thing that allowed

2034
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:25,040
it certainly the earlier versions to

2035
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:27,120
work and I feel that we have that sort

2036
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:29,120
of a little bit missing in in in other

2037
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:32,560
areas. So as you know people who are

2038
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:35,679
closest to the data and all its warts

2039
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:37,679
what type of like biological insights

2040
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:40,239
are missing and could possibly be

2041
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:43,760
encoded into these architectures to make

2042
01:25:40,239 --> 01:25:46,159
them better. Um can I I can take that.

2043
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:48,719
So I I really enjoyed your talk, Dana,

2044
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:51,679
because you talked about like that we

2045
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:54,800
should work on algorithms that make

2046
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:57,320
practical biological discoveries versus

2047
01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:02,120
algorithms that are super fancy, which I

2048
01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:06,080
am resonate with a lot 100% 100%.

2049
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:07,280
And um but but I your question was a

2050
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,120
little bit different which is that what

2051
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:15,679
what sorts of information that we know

2052
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:18,239
exist in biology that we can leverage um

2053
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:19,760
I think into the architecture I can just

2054
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:21,840
give I can give an example like Caroline

2055
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:24,800
and I are working on something um

2056
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,560
together uh uh there's a EWSC fellow

2057
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,320
working on it which you know we did try

2058
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,000
to take this is a good example actually

2059
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,679
because we took we tried to do what you

2060
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,840
said because we were like, oh, we'll

2061
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:36,480
just take the offtheshelf thing and

2062
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:38,159
we'll apply it to the biological data

2063
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:41,760
because, you know, it worked in alpha

2064
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:44,800
fold or it worked in um ESM fold and and

2065
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:47,280
I think what happened was that um it

2066
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:50,080
didn't work actually because there's

2067
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:54,800
there's features about bio the data that

2068
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:57,120
there there there's um uh uh naive like

2069
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:59,679
uh naive solutions that can find about

2070
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:01,679
biology that are not interesting like

2071
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:04,719
just like the local composition of cells

2072
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:06,239
is highly predictive of what you're

2073
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,520
going to be. And that's like you can

2074
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:11,199
know that, but it's like not an

2075
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:13,280
interesting thing to learn. And you

2076
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:15,040
know, one thing that we realized was

2077
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,120
that if you take into account that

2078
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:18,000
tissues are

2079
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:19,440
hierarchical, right? And if you can

2080
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,560
design an architecture that leverages

2081
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:26,360
the hierarchy of the the the tissue, you

2082
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:28,400
actually learn things that are not

2083
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:30,000
trivial. And that was a really cool

2084
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:31,440
result. I mean, we're still seeing how

2085
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,960
it plays out, but like it's like an

2086
01:27:31,440 --> 01:27:34,719
exact example of what you talked about.

2087
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:37,520
We spent like a year and a half trying

2088
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:39,280
to just like use the the, you know, the

2089
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:41,760
naive thing of just like cramming it in

2090
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:43,199
there. Um, and then we Sorry, I I'll

2091
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,639
finish. I I just want to say that this

2092
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:47,280
is a real world example of what you just

2093
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:50,080
said. Great. We're going to take now

2094
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:54,000
lightning questions. You have 17

2095
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:56,639
seconds. Go. Um Um, actually, I have two

2096
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,639
questions. Why you No, no, no. You You

2097
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,000
have one and you've already used and

2098
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:03,040
you've already used four of your

2099
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,199
seconds. Okay. Um so in the past two

2100
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:07,239
years we see so many foundation models

2101
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:10,400
or language models

2102
01:28:07,239 --> 01:28:12,800
um doing uh happening in this in this

2103
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:16,000
field. I was just wondering what is

2104
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:18,000
beyond the re beyond the reach of

2105
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,400
current foundation models like what

2106
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,880
tasks cannot be finished with the

2107
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:25,920
current foundation models. Excellent.

2108
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:29,400
And right on time good job. Many many

2109
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:32,639
many most tasks

2110
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:34,480
Ah, we are are you foundation model

2111
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:36,000
skeptics at the moment? Do you feel like

2112
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:37,440
we don't have the data to make

2113
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,520
foundation models? What what did that

2114
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:42,000
all mean? It's a strong reaction. I can

2115
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,600
go ahead first if you like. I was just

2116
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,600
saying that, you know, although it can

2117
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,679
answer some questions, the an the

2118
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,280
questions it can answer is far fewer

2119
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:51,280
than the questions that it cannot

2120
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:53,199
answer. I'm not a skepticism of

2121
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:55,199
skepticism of foundation models. I'm

2122
01:28:53,199 --> 01:28:59,840
just saying that that that question has

2123
01:28:55,199 --> 01:29:02,480
an easy answer. I see I formulated but

2124
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:04,560
but you're only skeptical at the moment

2125
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:06,800
that it's not going to give you what you

2126
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:09,840
want to know. That's good. That's a good

2127
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:11,360
answer. Okay. Very clear. I'm skeptical

2128
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:13,199
about foundation models specifically,

2129
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:15,280
but I feel like the thing that's missing

2130
01:29:13,199 --> 01:29:17,760
right now is that we are not leveraging

2131
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:19,600
enough the ability of language models to

2132
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,800
do function calling to be able to do

2133
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,239
this thing called tool use where

2134
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,159
essentially instead of outputting a

2135
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:26,320
result the thing called called function

2136
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:28,560
calling which is that instead of instead

2137
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:30,560
of uh outputting a result instead of

2138
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:33,760
like asking a question getting an answer

2139
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:36,080
you ask it a question and it gives you

2140
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,440
uh it gives you a function call it it

2141
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:39,360
basically tells you how to solve the

2142
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,960
answer using the tools that you

2143
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,560
different type of foundation though.

2144
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,000
Yeah, that's right. So basically instead

2145
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,000
of trying to solve instead of trying to

2146
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,760
say you know in what pathway does this

2147
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
gene lie instead it should be able to

2148
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,760
return to you the parameters of the

2149
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,600
function the parameters and the function

2150
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:55,199
you should call to solve it and you have

2151
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,360
a complete hold on that. So I think if

2152
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:59,360
we sort of couple foundation models with

2153
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:01,280
tool use in that specific way I think

2154
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,800
you can do a lot more in part you can

2155
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:04,880
solve the hallucination problem. I just

2156
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,639
want to clarify. I'm not skeptical. You

2157
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,560
know, I actually love the approach. I'm

2158
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:11,040
just saying that it's early days. There

2159
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:12,880
are many things that needs to be done.

2160
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:15,840
Okay. Yeah. No, no, we're not saying

2161
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:17,840
what might eventually happen. It's just

2162
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:21,040
does it do what you need today? And

2163
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:23,920
you've said no. Okay. The answer for me,

2164
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:26,560
I I am the answer.

2165
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:28,159
Okay. If their answer is all no, then my

2166
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:30,560
answer is clearly no. because the only

2167
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:33,040
way you go from DNA to the life

2168
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:36,560
phenotype of the organism human is

2169
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:38,480
traversing through from DNA through all

2170
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:41,600
of the other modalities. Okay. So,

2171
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:43,520
nobody is skeptical. That's excellent.

2172
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,120
Wonderful. We had a question over here.

2173
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:47,960
Well, I'm skeptical. Very quick

2174
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:51,000
questions and more

2175
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:54,480
actionable question is

2176
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,480
that address

2177
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:01,840
to you know interview a wonderful

2178
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:06,639
technology platform you know for decades

2179
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:10,120
and 1995 you know if you go back uh

2180
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:12,960
people discover the you know

2181
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:17,120
DNA 43

2182
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:19,880
uh original was a HIV one suppressor but

2183
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:24,480
later on we have a good

2184
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:27,840
news 2020 we find that theocracy of it

2185
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:31,040
can related to

2186
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:35,239
And I wonder you know why they don't you

2187
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:38,880
know focus all this effort and

2188
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:42,800
technology you know large scale data to

2189
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:46,000
handle this and come up a solution. All

2190
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:48,560
right we'll give that to Mark. Sure. And

2191
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,840
I I wouldn't say it's not happening. I

2192
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:51,040
guess it's maybe not happening at the

2193
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:54,800
Broad Institute, but there are certainly

2194
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:56,679
a lot of people who are focused on that

2195
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:59,760
particular question with respect to

2196
01:31:56,679 --> 01:32:02,000
TDP43, its molecular consequences and

2197
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,679
what the rest of the genome tells us

2198
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,280
about where there might be opportunities

2199
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:07,600
to intervene. And I think there are some

2200
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:10,880
that have emerged from the population

2201
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:13,679
genetic studies of ALS.

2202
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:17,840
And you now you want Well, no, no, we're

2203
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:22,480
gonna have to stop here because it it is

2204
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:26,480
Sorry, you guys can talk afterwards,

2205
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:28,320
but I was assigned to keep us on time.

2206
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:30,880
And what we've what we've learned is

2207
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:32,800
there are so many rich questions that

2208
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:34,760
remain and that's going to be the case.

2209
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,960
And we should all continue this

2210
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:39,120
conversation with the folks up here on

2211
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:42,719
the panel and with each other. This was

2212
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:44,320
an amazingly stimulating session. Uh

2213
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:46,960
thank you to all the people who make

2214
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:49,600
data make the methods to make data first

2215
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:52,960
and then actually make data and and have

2216
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:55,520
stimulated so much work. You know deep

2217
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,520
uh Alphafold would not be here but for

2218
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,760
the tremendous amount of protein

2219
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:02,000
structure and sequence that was there

2220
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:04,080
and all the things that are happening we

2221
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,600
heard about today are happening because

2222
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:09,679
these new sources of data are just

2223
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:12,600
burgeoning. And so this wonderful

2224
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:15,280
symbiosis between data creation and data

2225
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:17,920
analysis and the fact that we're mostly

2226
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:19,840
doing both of those things together uh

2227
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:22,320
is a great way to end. We have a whole

2228
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:24,000
another day tomorrow of exciting talks.

2229
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:26,239
I looked I peaked. It's a very good

2230
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,880
list. But we're going to declare victory

2231
01:33:26,239 --> 01:33:33,280
now. And uh we'll be back at what time

2232
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:35,180
tomorrow? 9 a.m. 900 a.m. for yet more.

2233
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:41,629
See you then.

2234
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:41,629
[Applause]
