1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,040
all right well it is a pleasure to be

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,359
here today uh and this is obviously such

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,120
an important topic and it's a you know

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,040
great group of people that's talking

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,200
about this and hopefully we can work

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,040
together and come up with some great

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,000
Solutions on addressing this so as y

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,680
Yuri mentioned I wear a few different

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,199
hats today I'm going to be talking a lot

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,560
more about the work we've been doing at

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,920
MIT uh in both understanding but more

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,920
importantly mitigating the environmental

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,520
impact of AI data centers Computing but

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,200
I'll also add a little bit of flavor as

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,079
a person who uh also moonlights as a

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,160
chief technology officer and attempts to

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,320
buy space at different data centers and

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,800
set up heavy compute in order to make

19
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,640
customers build larger bigger systems so

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,960
I'll I'll go through my slides and look

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,160
forward to any questions that you have

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,719
I'll try to get through things quickly

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,680
so we can have a robust discussion

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,680
because there is just so much Nuance in

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,760
this topic and there'll be times where I

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,359
come off as a real defeatist and like oh

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,079
sucks uh and then there are times where

28
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,040
there are some h GE opportunities and I

29
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,799
think with this group of people here

30
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,600
there are some really interesting

31
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,799
opportunities even in the world of data

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,960
centers and Computing and being able to

33
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,439
bring all of these pieces together and

34
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,920
there may be some uh interesting

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,920
conversation that comes off of

36
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,600
that so let me just start with a little

37
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,000
bit in case uh you're not as familiar

38
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,960
with the environmental impact of AI and

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,400
what's causing it so the first is over

40
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,720
the past few years there has been a

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,880
rapid growth in the models that we're

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,640
using that power a lot of the services

43
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,960
that we're now using so when you take

44
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,119
something like gp4 or GPT 40 those

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,159
models are hundreds to thousands of

46
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,920
times larger than models that we were

47
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,960
using maybe just a few years ago and

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,560
while it's not exactly directly linearly

49
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,399
proportional but there is a pretty

50
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,600
strong correlation the larger the model

51
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:59,680
the larger the energy use that's both on

52
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,320
training it as well as on inference or

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,680
when actually interacting with these

54
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,520
models and in fact by some of our

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,520
estimates we've seen that just in the

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,560
last 5 years we've seen an over 100x

57
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,000
growth and everyone keeps predicting

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,040
that oh well this is the last year when

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,319
it's not going to grow again then

60
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,680
someone comes out with the new 10

61
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,239
trillion model uh 10 trillion parameter

62
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,280
model so this growth seems to still be

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,840
growing and as we look at different

64
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,959
types of models moving away from text to

65
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,440
video to image those models are growing

66
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,239
larger and larger so is the energy

67
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,160
impact of that and I I help found our

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,840
supercomputing Center at Lincoln

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,040
laboratory in MIT and so we also track

70
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,200
where Computing performance is going and

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,480
that growth has not been as steep uh and

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,480
in fact if we look at some of our

73
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,680
estimates our growth is maybe about 10x

74
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,480
every 5 years and so we have this huge

75
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,519
need of being able to map the the

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,120
tremendous amount of computing and the

77
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,560
increase in Computing demands with our

78
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,879
Computing systems which are not

79
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,720
necessarily growing as fast and in fact

80
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,000
that Gap is growing further and further

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,560
apart now the solution that a lot of

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,720
people have had is well just throw a

83
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,360
much larger system at the problem and

84
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,840
while that does satisfy uh you know

85
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,519
getting you this works that does help

86
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,840
you over there what it does not do is

87
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,159
solve an energy uh crisis or growing

88
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,080
problem that we're seeing in that space

89
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,040
and here are just some other uh I call

90
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,400
these like wild ass guesses because

91
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,560
really don't know um but this is what

92
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,000
you know you talk to to folks across you

93
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,040
know the iea and groups like that these

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,720
are some of the estimates that they have

95
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,760
um So currently data centers uh are you

96
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,239
know about 1 to 2% of global energy

97
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,519
demand I've heard people comparing it to

98
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,360
the airline industry so we use about as

99
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,120
much energy as the airline industry or

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,159
we have as much emissions as the airline

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
industry which is reasonably large and

102
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,120
that number is expected to increase

103
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,280
between this super accurate 8 to 21% uh

104
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,599
by 2030 right and a lot of this is

105
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
because we really don't know right

106
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:00,599
there's a lot of things that could occur

107
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,799
that could change this Trend in a in a

108
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,799
very significant way but I think what we

109
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,959
all agree upon is that this is going to

110
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,120
grow to be a pretty sizable amount of

111
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,480
energy use and a growing contributor to

112
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,040
uh emissions across the world there's a

113
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,079
lot of water that's being used by these

114
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,519
systems you have to cool them somehow uh

115
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,959
and as you're getting uh larger and

116
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,880
larger Footprints and Tighter and

117
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,320
Tighter spaces you need more and more

118
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,800
aggressive cooling technology so you

119
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,120
have a lot of water that's going into

120
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,000
these and we often just talk about the

121
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,759
operational side of these data centers

122
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,199
which is how much energy we're using to

123
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,919
power it on but we forget about is that

124
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,120
this new hardware comes at another cost

125
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,080
and we often refer to that as the

126
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,400
embodied carbon footprint but this is

127
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,240
how much carbon has gone into the

128
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,600
manufacturing of these processors and we

129
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,880
actually don't know anything about that

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,840
I actually lead a subgroup within uh an

131
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,120
organization called the open compute

132
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,320
project or the ocp and all we ended up

133
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,759
with is we don't know uh and we had

134
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,600
contributions from these different

135
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,160
organizations and there's a little bit

136
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,680
of people don't want to share there's a

137
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,639
lot of we don't know the full supply

138
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,080
chain and where it comes from but this

139
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,199
is another contributor and so while the

140
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,639
arguments often made that hey let's get

141
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,840
you know using a more efficient

142
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,880
processor right going from a V100 to an

143
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,800
h100 in theory should reduce the envir

144
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,280
operational environmental footprint we

145
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,400
don't know what the embodied cost of

146
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,199
that is to figure out when those

147
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,600
crossover points occur but I like to

148
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,960
think about this as you know I think in

149
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,120
a very conservative Way by using just

150
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,560
some of really simple techniques we

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,720
should be able or shave off you know 10

152
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,800
to 20% of this energy demand which would

153
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,720
then translate to roughly 1 to 2% of the

154
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,720
global electricity demand which I think

155
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,560
is pretty exciting and this is without

156
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,400
doing anything uh too crazy or too

157
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,720
wacky and the reason for this is and we

158
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,400
talk about this growth is because of

159
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,160
training and inference and there's a lot

160
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,199
of anecdotes and I have a few over here

161
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,000
you know training gpt3 emitted what 500

162
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,440
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent

163
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,919
um you know some great papers that have

164
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:04,240
come out using GPT 4 for every 100 words

165
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:06,240
consumes three bottles of water uh if

166
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,199
you have some of the work that we did if

167
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,840
you do about a million tokens of GPT

168
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,440
right which is about a bucks worth of

169
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,440
compute uh that's like driving a gas car

170
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,080
5 to 20 miles in terms of carbon

171
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,199
emissions um you know another great uh

172
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,160
anecdote that I love is every time you

173
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,960
mess around with stability or you try to

174
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,680
create an image on that uh that's like

175
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,240
charging your cell phone and so on the

176
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,120
training side while the numbers are

177
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,840
large on an individual case and so 500

178
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,160
metric tons of carbon dioxide obviously

179
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,759
is quite large and you look at some of

180
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,520
these newer models multiply that by 10

181
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,840
to 20x um the inference side is probably

182
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,479
the one that's going to cause us a lot

183
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,520
more trouble and heartache in the future

184
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,759
just for a couple of reasons one is the

185
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,880
scale at which it happens right charging

186
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,280
a cell phone you know making an image

187
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,000
how many millions or billions of times

188
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,160
does that action occur or how many

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,639
people are routinely interacting with a

190
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,759
large language model uh or creating a

191
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,440
new video right like using Sora and what

192
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,440
is the environmental impact of that and

193
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,800
a lot of this is we need to measure it

194
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,039
we need to get a better understanding so

195
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,240
there's some great anecdotes that you

196
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,080
can work with but at a large scale it's

197
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,160
still not fully

198
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,560
understood and I like to think of this

199
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,160
even beyond the environmental impact

200
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,080
it's always great when we're able to you

201
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,440
know and coming in from you know the the

202
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,840
startup side there is this huge

203
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:32,440
opportunity where we can reduce the

204
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,639
energy and environmental impact of AI

205
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,759
and also have economic incentives to do

206
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,240
so so this isn't a huge capex that you

207
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,000
need to invest to cut down your energy

208
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,160
emissions but you can employ some of

209
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,039
these techniques and cut your Opex cut

210
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,759
your cut your own bill and so there's

211
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,400
this great opportunity to align our

212
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,080
incentives in terms of making money

213
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,680
along with helping the environment and

214
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,639
this it's very rare that you see a

215
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,240
problem where you can do good and make

216
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,240
money at the same time and so I just

217
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,159
wanted to mention that uh for those that

218
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,720
are looking to move this up to chain uh

219
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:06,720
but it's often there's another argument

220
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,840
that you can make uh where you're able

221
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,159
to talk about cost savings uh or imp

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,639
Improvement of Roi rather than just

223
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:16,000
saving the environment which you know I

224
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,680
love to talk about the environment but a

225
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,560
lot of people you know it's it's a nice

226
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,560
end uh piece but not the first

227
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,720
one so I can tell you from my experience

228
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,479
I can't buy data center space anymore I

229
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,520
I often in the market for 1 to two

230
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,879
megawatts of power right we have

231
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,519
relatively small so we're not doing

232
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,279
gigawatt size deployments but it's very

233
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,839
tough to find them uh most Enterprises

234
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,640
including probably many of you here are

235
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,039
severely overpaying for the resources

236
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,440
that you're using you have overr

237
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,680
provisioned probably by 5 to 10x because

238
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,880
you don't know what you're uh

239
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,880
necessarily using and what the actual

240
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,800
mapping between the hardware and your

241
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,399
workloads are so you're often buying

242
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,640
something that's much larger and you're

243
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,240
grabbing it because you can and then

244
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,640
there is a a a break in this value chain

245
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,720
because all of these individual pieces

246
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,920
are separate from each other and there's

247
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,240
no interconnectivity across all of these

248
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,560
so you have energy companies that are

249
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,279
trying to work with data centers who are

250
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,839
then trying to work with AI companies

251
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,800
and none of these groups are actually

252
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,360
sharing information with each other and

253
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,519
so they're all making these sort of

254
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,880
Oddball assumptions that are not true

255
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:27,000
and everyone's dropping a lot of

256
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,680
resources on the floor because of

257
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,200
that but there are a few things that you

258
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,560
can do about this right so first of all

259
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,720
if we could get the energy Data Center

260
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,160
and uh AI companies together there is

261
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,079
this huge opportunity for cross

262
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,640
optimization across these and this is

263
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:44,560
some work that the hyperscalers are

264
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,279
doing so you're thinking of you know the

265
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,200
Amazon and the Googles but not something

266
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,880
that most other companies uh have the

267
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,760
ability because they don't actually cut

268
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,120
across all of those components as well

269
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,600
the second is that we can use

270
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,160
intelligent energy reduction and

271
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,800
scheduling systems uh I think this came

272
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,600
up in the in the last talk but a lot of

273
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,720
things are not time sensitive and you

274
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
can have some huge carbon savings or

275
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,560
environmental or Energy savings if

276
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,399
you're willing to move shift times or

277
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,200
shift Geographic zones also think that

278
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:18,160
you need to be able to make your

279
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:21,160
software uh and AI carbon aware there is

280
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,720
a huge variation in carbon uh emissions

281
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,360
and carbon uh uh impact through the day

282
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,839
through the year there's some great

283
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,000
opportunities there to make your

284
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,360
software platforms under understand that

285
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,240
and work with it and I'll give an

286
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,200
example of that and I think that there's

287
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,000
also you know using AI to help the

288
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,760
climate as well is another opportunity I

289
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,279
just wanted to highlight one which I

290
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,240
think is super cool this is actually a a

291
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,000
company that was working with our

292
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,959
startup they uh designed a model called

293
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,279
climate GPT uh and what they did is they

294
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,200
took a bunch of scientific literature

295
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,920
and they trained a model and they had

296
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,519
two sort of levels of impact here one

297
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,079
was they were able to achieve the same

298
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,519
level of performance with a model that

299
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:01,639
was about a tenth of the size of a

300
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,000
larger model which wasn't fine-tuned or

301
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,000
specifically trained on this data set

302
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,240
and the second is it is one of the only

303
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,839
models that's trained with scientific

304
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,839
data from the ground up in uh actually

305
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,079
answering questions related to climate

306
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,079
change and so helping shed a light and

307
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,839
answering questions uh with scientific

308
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:24,680
uh papers and references so people can

309
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,320
actually use that for for their

310
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,639
work all right so I just want to do a

311
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,560
quick thing on you know how do we even

312
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,320
measure the carbon footprint of a data

313
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,320
center uh I will uh you know uh be the

314
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,720
first to admit that this is high level

315
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,680
uh this is not meant to be super

316
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,120
detailed uh but if you kind of look at

317
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,079
the total carbon footprint of your

318
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,800
system at a high level you break it up

319
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,000
into two pieces which is what I call the

320
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,920
embodied from most organizations that

321
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,959
would be your ghd protocol scope 3 uh as

322
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,519
well as your operational footprint which

323
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,639
again for most organizations that are

324
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,800
not running these systems themselves

325
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,839
that's your scope to emissions within

326
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,160
the embodied footprint uh you have

327
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,279
things like chip

328
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,680
manufacturing um storage and memory

329
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:06,160
manufacturing component networking all

330
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,639
of those different so think of all of

331
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,240
the materials transportation all of that

332
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,440
falls into embodied and on the

333
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,000
operational side is your how much energy

334
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,720
is actually being used by your compute

335
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,399
or your data center what's the carbon

336
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,279
intensity of the grid what is the

337
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,920
specific application usage and how is

338
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,279
that varying over

339
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,800
time if you're trying to calculate the

340
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,760
operational footprint it's usually one

341
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,560
of the most common ratios you'll hear is

342
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:33,600
something called Pue or power usage

343
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,320
Effectiveness this is the amount of

344
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,519
energy that goes into operating a Data

345
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,440
Center and it's often a ratio that's

346
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,000
called Pue is often shared I have my

347
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,560
qualms with that particular metric but

348
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,480
it's it's a very common metric that's

349
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,760
used to indicate how efficient or

350
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,199
inefficient a system is one of the most

351
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,639
efficient data centers you'll you'll

352
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:55,279
come across will be close to about one

353
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,519
um probably a little bit over that and

354
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,480
then your global average is about 1.58

355
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,040
which means about 50% of the energ is

356
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,440
going towards non-computing tasks such

357
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,360
as cooling or other ancillary tasks that

358
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,120
a data center might have and so we talk

359
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,440
to a lot of organizations and like oh

360
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,079
that's easy I can cut my operational

361
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,199
footprint to zero and how how are you

362
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,760
doing that so they want to use renewable

363
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:18,639
energy or there's a lot of accounting

364
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,360
tricks that people can also do in order

365
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,800
to make that happen and I think that's

366
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,880
certainly a worthy Endeavor I do like to

367
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,440
argue though that at any given time

368
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,920
moving to Renewables is somewhat of a

369
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,720
zero sum game in that you using more

370
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,279
renewable for your data center just

371
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,760
makes it either more expensive or less

372
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,399
available uh at that given time so it's

373
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,760
not reducing the carbon emissions at

374
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,240
that moment it makes you feel good and

375
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,800
it is a demand signal to the energy grid

376
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,639
that hey we would like to invest in this

377
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,240
so I think it's absolutely worthwhile

378
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,279
but we think that that's shouldn't be

379
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,800
the only answer and in fact we think

380
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:55,959
that the aim should be to reduce the

381
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,480
energy use and not just shift to

382
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,480
renewable energy

383
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,199
and the other piece which I talked about

384
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,000
earlier is the embodied footprint uh so

385
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:07,959
one of the efforts that we've been

386
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,680
trying to to work and you know this is

387
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:12,959
with the open compute project uh is

388
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,079
actually lead a group in trying to

389
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,759
standardize some of this information it

390
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:18,800
turns out that it is possible to

391
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:22,800
calculate the embodied carbon footprint

392
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,560
to some level of accuracy um however

393
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,560
there is no standardized metric and so

394
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,040
we often make these very uh broad

395
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,120
assumptions about oh you must be in this

396
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,800
energy Grid in so that must be the or

397
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,800
you must be using this etching process

398
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,800
so that must be the footprint of that

399
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,839
what we're trying to work with the

400
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,120
industry in the community is to see if

401
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,959
we can standardize some of these terms

402
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,120
so that we can make more of these Apples

403
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,320
to Apples comparisons because a lot of

404
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,440
organizations would like to know hey

405
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,120
should I be upgrading my uh processors

406
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,279
or should I keep it at the same here's

407
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,360
how much usage I have and here's the

408
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,680
carbon cost of a new one uh that's the

409
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,839
kind of information that we're trying to

410
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,720
get off of organizations still I think

411
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,680
work to go there um but there is an

412
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,360
opportunity and especially for people

413
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,680
that are buying a lot of processors to

414
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,320
tell your vendors that this is

415
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,880
information you want it's again it's

416
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,160
about creating that demand signal uh and

417
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,320
ensuring that while there's been this

418
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,839
arms race of building larger and larger

419
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,560
systems can we actually convince them to

420
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,199
like hey just pause for a second and

421
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,759
give us some of this additional

422
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:28,160
information all right so I I know I just

423
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,399
covered a whole bunch of stuff there

424
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,240
real quick um but now I want to talk to

425
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,399
you about all right AI sucks it's bad

426
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,399
for the environment okay there's a lot

427
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,880
of ways that it it hurts us but are

428
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,120
there things that we can actually do to

429
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,480
reduce this footprint and I'm going to

430
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,880
just pick a few things over here there's

431
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,560
obviously dozens of things or hundreds

432
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,560
of things that you could possibly do in

433
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,240
this space I just wanted to talk about a

434
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,040
few things that we're doing within my

435
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,959
group at MIT to actually reduce the data

436
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,480
center footprint a lot of this was

437
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,079
actually was created by necessity about

438
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,440
a few this is somewhere Co so what four

439
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,040
years ago now we had a huge heat wave in

440
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,240
the summer and we were struggling to

441
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,040
keep our super computer running um and

442
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,360
the cooling demand was growing very

443
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,560
quickly uh and so we started to think

444
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,440
about can we do something for ourselves

445
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,680
because this is is kind of nuts right uh

446
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,319
it was one of those hot jues and so we

447
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,319
started to investigate different

448
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:26,360
techniques and that sort of kicked off

449
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:29,319
this whole area of research which we

450
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,600
absolutely you know dog food ourselves

451
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:32,480
uh but has also had value even outside

452
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,399
of our

453
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,959
organization and so you know some really

454
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,279
highlevel ways right if you want to

455
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,639
reduce your data center footprint what

456
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,800
can you do reduce the amount of compute

457
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,440
that you have okay there's obvious many

458
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,880
ways in which you could do that you

459
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,319
could reduce the energy intensity of the

460
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,079
compute right so you're trying to do the

461
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:54,040
same task but maybe make it a little bit

462
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:57,519
more energy efficient replace that uh

463
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,639
bulb with an LED bulb for example or you

464
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,800
could use lower carbon power maybe I can

465
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,799
Tri shift my uh training to a geographic

466
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,919
location that has less carbon intensity

467
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,400
or maybe I could find a time of day

468
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:10,480
that's a little less carbon intense if

469
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,480
it's a short task or maybe I could

470
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,240
switch in a a cheaper model instead of

471
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,799
uh using this huge model at when I'm at

472
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,280
these carbon intense

473
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:21,839
times so I'll just give you a couple of

474
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,199
really quick examples we have a lot of

475
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,640
papers that we've written about this

476
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,160
topic most of the software is open

477
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,720
source uh and happy to to share this or

478
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,320
have a discussion after this as well

479
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,280
so I just want to talk about the model

480
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,640
training process that many of us go

481
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,320
through and the example that I'm going

482
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,480
to use here was used for a drug

483
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,760
Discovery problem and so we were

484
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,640
training you know graph neural networks

485
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,880
uh for material Discovery and Drug

486
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,559
Discovery right so you're trying to find

487
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,919
you know what molecules or what

488
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:50,400
materials do you put next to each other

489
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,600
uh in order to make a viable drug or a

490
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,960
viable material given certain properties

491
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,640
that you'd like to satisfy traditional

492
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,760
way we do this is we take a thousand of

493
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,640
these candidates and we run them all and

494
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,200
see what happens and oh yep that that

495
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,120
one model was really good let's keep it

496
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,520
the rest yeah sure I learned a lesson

497
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:12,120
but I I I really didn't need that

498
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,200
information and so we had this idea that

499
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,039
look there's a lot that goes on in this

500
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:20,600
training process could we not determine

501
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:23,039
much earlier that your models are

502
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,720
unlikely to yield success and so we

503
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,120
built this tool called training speed

504
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,280
estimation in which we actually track

505
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,799
the loss curve of the models that we're

506
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,679
training so instead of training now

507
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,880
these hundreds or thousands of models to

508
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,640
convergence or to completion we actually

509
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,559
train them partway usually about 10 to

510
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,440
20% but we track how the loss curve is

511
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,360
progressing and we can make some pretty

512
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,840
good predictions about what that

513
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,640
endstate converged accuracy is going to

514
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,760
look like so what that allows us to do

515
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,520
is only after about 10 to 20% of the

516
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,080
runs be able to eliminate essentially

517
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,200
all of the runs that are unlikely to

518
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,120
yield high performance unlikely to yield

519
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,600
good performance to instead f Fus our

520
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,280
computation on that 10 to 20% of the

521
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,840
models that are likely to yield higher

522
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,679
performance and so what that allows us

523
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,400
to do is quickly shave off about 80% of

524
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:12,120
the

525
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,280
compute with no impact to the end model

526
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,400
because again we're trying to highlight

527
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,200
that one or two different models that

528
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,280
are of value to us and so we've applied

529
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,799
this to a variety of problems and it's

530
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,039
actually given us some some really

531
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,120
exciting results uh and so this is a

532
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,840
graph neural network called schnet uh

533
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,520
which is used in material Discovery uh

534
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,000
what we have on this plot over here is

535
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,000
if you look at the this never works uh

536
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,679
on the uh xaxis here is the true loss so

537
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,720
if we actually ran this model to

538
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,840
convergence what would the loss be and

539
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,720
on the y- AIS is the predicted loss

540
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,840
after about 20% of the runs and so if we

541
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,120
were doing perfectly you should see all

542
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,760
the dots line up on that green line but

543
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,120
you can see that most of the dots are

544
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,919
right around that green line which means

545
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,159
in most cases we're able to pretty

546
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,360
closely predict what that true LW

547
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,919
would be with only about 10 to 20% of

548
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,480
the runs I think in this particular use

549
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:07,919
case it was 20% of the runs and so what

550
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,640
that allows us to do now is focus all

551
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,919
our computation just on these four or

552
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,440
five models that are in that lower box

553
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,720
right because they're still within that

554
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,000
error margin so we don't want to just

555
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,559
pick the top one but we can pick now the

556
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,360
the just three or four that are in that

557
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,200
little box where we believe that the

558
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,280
true loss and the predicted loss will be

559
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,280
as close to zero as

560
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,559
possible right so that's just one way so

561
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,200
you can think of that as let me just how

562
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,520
do I reduce the Demand right how do I

563
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,840
just reduce the amount of computing I

564
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,200
need to even build my models from now on

565
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,280
right so that's one approach uh another

566
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,919
thing that you can do is reduce the

567
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,960
intensity or the energy intensity this

568
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,240
is the replacing your bulb with an LED

569
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,159
bulb equivalent of uh things right so

570
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,159
one way you could do that is to make

571
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:54,000
your existing Hardware just magically

572
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,440
use less energy or less power um uh the

573
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,559
second thing that you can do is probably

574
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,880
use more efficient hardware and there's

575
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:00,159
I think both are are excellent

576
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,799
opportunities depending on what you're

577
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,919
trying to do we were really surprised

578
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,840
that that first one which is just making

579
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:08,840
existing Hardware use less energy

580
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,440
there's a very simple way of doing that

581
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,480
we just limit the amount of power that

582
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,400
goes to our processor we just tell it

583
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,679
I'm sorry you want 250 Watts we're going

584
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,120
to let you we're not going to let you

585
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,760
cross 150 watts for example and

586
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,200
obviously using more efficient Hardware

587
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,120
means newer systems that are better

588
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,559
designed for the workload uh that you're

589
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,720
trying to

590
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:32,039
process and so one of the super simple

591
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,320
techniques that you could like go home

592
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:36,919
and do today is something that we call

593
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,520
power capping uh and what we do here is

594
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:41,640
basically limit the amount of power

595
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,200
that's available to a processor and we

596
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,760
thought this is there's no way this can

597
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,240
work this is way too easy turns out it

598
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,000
works extremely well and we've been

599
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,360
running this on our supercomputer for

600
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,799
about two years now we've had a group

601
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,600
complain and it happens to one of the

602
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,720
groups we collaborate with so they

603
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,640
caught us but no one actually noticed

604
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,440
that we did this when we turned it on

605
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,679
and what we do by default is we actually

606
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,240
limit our uh processors our gpus which

607
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,159
is the vast majority about 70 to 80% of

608
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,559
the power goes to our gpus within our

609
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:17,000
system we we limit those to about 60 to

610
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:19,640
80% um of their total power so rather

611
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,320
than letting them go to to 100% we kind

612
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,559
of limit them and in many cases 150 to

613
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,279
250 Watts depending on which processor

614
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:30,000
we're using uh We've applied these to a

615
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,080
variety of both training and inference

616
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,679
uh and not only does it reduce the

617
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,159
overall power and energy consumption of

618
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,360
the workloads but it also reduces the

619
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,720
operating temperatures and we did a we

620
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,559
actually had an economist on the team

621
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,400
last year and did like a year-long

622
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,880
analysis of this power capping and how

623
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,760
it worked on our system um we were able

624
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,799
to show that uh we our gpus on average

625
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,400
run about 40° Fahrenheit cooler uh than

626
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,400
you would find if you didn't have this

627
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,080
technique installed or this technique

628
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,159
running and what that also allows us to

629
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,360
do is obviously reduce our cooling costs

630
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:03,919
but more importantly improves the

631
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,919
hardware reliability because running

632
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,840
your processor cooler means that they

633
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,640
can last a little bit longer which means

634
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,960
now our embodied carbon footprint goes

635
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,640
down so it's this wonderful little cycle

636
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,000
that we're able to see doing this uh and

637
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,240
we've you know applied this to a bunch

638
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,559
of problems and it's just it's it's

639
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,240
funny how this is such a simple

640
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:23,720
technique it was funny because I was

641
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,200
talking to you know we buy a lot of uh

642
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,120
pretty beefy gear in my startup right so

643
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,400
these are six U boxes that usually have

644
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,279
about

645
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,360
kilow in them power capping is Now

646
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:36,159
default when you're buying these dgx

647
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,640
type boxes because it turned out the

648
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,799
warranty Replacements because the

649
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,400
reliability was so bad so some of this

650
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:43,840
research is actually helping uh people

651
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,960
like y they actually come in with a

652
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,559
default power cap because what was

653
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,360
happening is one of the gpus would often

654
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,880
get unseated it turns into a warranty

655
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,200
thing and so they come with default you

656
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,600
can obviously turn it off it's a simple

657
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,960
setting uh that you can undo if you want

658
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,919
but we're seeing that people are

659
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,480
starting to actually send these boxes

660
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,320
out with some of this capping now

661
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,960
installed because it really does have

662
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,520
minimal impact uh to the workload but it

663
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,279
does have a very large impact to the

664
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,080
hardware and for those who are wondering

665
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,600
like how does this work it's like

666
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,480
driving a car uh at least that's the

667
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,200
analogy that we saw you can there's two

668
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,960
ways to get your gas mileage right if

669
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,320
you're trying to make a certain distance

670
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,159
you can go fast slow fast slow or you

671
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,279
can drive at a somewhat constant speed

672
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,640
and both might get you there about the

673
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,320
same amount of time but one of them has

674
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,320
far better efficiency and sort of the

675
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,799
same intuition behind what's going on

676
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,120
here but it has to do with like thermal

677
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,840
power caps and aggressive clocking that

678
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,720
the processors

679
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,159
have and then another thing obviously is

680
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,320
you could just find more efficient

681
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:42,840
Hardware if you're using a processor

682
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,279
that's 15 years old there's a good

683
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,480
chance that a modern processor will be

684
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:49,080
able to perform the same task at a much

685
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,919
better rate and this is a um this is a

686
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,600
survey that my group at MIT has been

687
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,720
running for the past four years where we

688
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,799
track various Hardware accelerators and

689
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,559
what we have is the peak power here as

690
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,120
well as the Peak Performance in Giga

691
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:06,159
operations per second

692
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,760
um uh and what we're able to do is

693
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,360
basically track these Trends and so if

694
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,320
your processor is on this line you might

695
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,720
find more performance by moving up one

696
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,960
of the lines if you're able to uh if

697
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,840
you're able to do that for your

698
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,080
processor There's an opportunity here as

699
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,720
well to replace older Hardware with

700
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,360
newer Hardware that is just inherently

701
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,600
more efficient that can perform more

702
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,960
operations per watt of computation

703
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
and then I just finally wanted to talk

704
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,080
really quickly about the final one which

705
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,039
is using lower carbon power um it turns

706
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,440
out if you're not familiar that your

707
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,120
carbon intensity varies significantly

708
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,440
over time and location so this is a

709
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,640
couple of plots over a 48 hour period

710
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,080
just showing the carbon intensity of two

711
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,039
sites one's in the United States the

712
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,440
other's in the United Kingdom uh over

713
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:53,120
two times of the year and you can see

714
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,679
that there is this probably not a huge

715
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,840
surprise a hot summer day tends to be

716
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:58,640
more carbon intense uh than a cold

717
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,600
winter day if you're in Boston and you

718
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,520
have you know hydroelectric and solar

719
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,440
and stuff like that so what we were

720
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,159
thinking about is can I actually like we

721
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,480
got to do something about our software

722
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,039
right like our software doesn't know any

723
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,640
of this our software pretends that it's

724
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,880
all the same can our software actually

725
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,679
start to use this in designing in in in

726
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,919
the way that it operates and so we built

727
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,520
a couple of tools uh one of them is

728
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:26,640
called Clover and the core idea is this

729
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,200
if it's super carbon intense outside use

730
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,679
either a lower quality model

731
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,960
slow down your answers do something

732
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,320
about it and if it's not carbon intense

733
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,320
it's a nice day you know great

734
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:41,600
Renewables you got a good mix Going On

735
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:44,840
sure use your use your model and that

736
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,799
actually has a a fairly large impact and

737
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,480
it's this is just the starting of This

738
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,000
research area to be completely honest

739
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,360
but I think the opportunities are very

740
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,520
large so we did one experiment with

741
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,880
computer vision uh and so this was an

742
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,120
object detection problem uh we took a

743
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,080
few different models one model was I

744
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,640
think YOLO V8 which is you know

745
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,039
state-of-the-art computer vision model

746
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,760
for object detection you know beats

747
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,360
humans all of that stuff and then we

748
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,120
took another model which is probably a

749
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,919
few years older not as good but

750
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,880
reasonable but definitely a smaller

751
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,360
model less energy intensive and what we

752
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,240
did was we took that data that I showed

753
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,559
you on the previous slide uh of the

754
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,960
energy intensity and said look if you're

755
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,240
in that Peak energy intensity period use

756
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,520
the lower quality model if you're not in

757
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,720
that Peak energy intensity time use the

758
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,760
full model

759
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,440
and what we were able to show in this

760
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,760
experiment is that we can reduce the

761
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,279
carbon intensity for different types of

762
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,120
operations by about 80 to 90% so it's

763
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:41,760
the carbon emissions with an overall

764
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,240
reduction and accuracy of this model

765
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,399
over a 48 hour period by about 2 to 4%

766
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,840
and you could obviously adjust these uh

767
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:51,480
up and down a little bit if you're like

768
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:53,279
well I can't lose 2% I can only lose 1%

769
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,519
sure you could do that also and you'd

770
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,919
still see uh similar you your uh carbon

771
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,000
reduction might go down a little bit but

772
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,240
it would still be non-trivial or pretty

773
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,760
significant and obviously large language

774
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,640
models are the coolest things and so we

775
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,640
did the same we took the same idea and

776
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,600
applied it to a large language model

777
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,640
except here we were using actually open

778
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,840
Ai and what we did was instead of using

779
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,159
different models because we don't

780
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,600
necessarily have access to that we gave

781
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:19,279
what's called a generation directive

782
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,880
where we told the system hey instead of

783
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,159
uh giving me you know I can ask who is

784
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:25,279
the president of the United States I can

785
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,679
get an entire essay or I can get a

786
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,480
couple of sentences each of those has

787
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,200
very different different uh energy

788
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,440
consumption right remember the 100 words

789
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,600
is like three bottles of water um so you

790
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,840
can get 500 words you can get 50 words

791
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,799
and there's different bottles of water

792
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,919
that go for that and so we did the same

793
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,760
thing with uh with Chachi PT or open Ai

794
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:48,360
and a couple of other models as well and

795
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,000
we uh said if it's very carbon intense

796
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,600
limit your response give me a short

797
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,440
answer if it's not en if it's not carbon

798
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,159
intense go for it right give me give me

799
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,200
whatever and we measure that again and

800
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,559
so even here we were able to see about

801
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,600
70% carbon reduction with minimal

802
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,880
accuracy loss as measured by some of

803
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,519
these benchmarks like mlu and trivia QA

804
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,279
and things like that and so again

805
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:10,600
another opportunity if you're designing

806
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:13,760
these systems to think about can I

807
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,880
introduce carbon intensity uh as a as a

808
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,960
parameter that I'm also optimizing

809
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,399
around so I just want to end here

810
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,880
because I think I'm way over time at

811
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:23,919
this point

812
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,679
um we need more data this is a lot of

813
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,399
this has been done in our own system

814
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,279
which is certainly not uh represented of

815
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,440
the world right we happen to work with

816
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:34,960
you know some exceptional researchers

817
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,440
that are also very aware of the climate

818
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,960
impact of their work and they're willing

819
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,440
to make many of these tradeoffs in order

820
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,320
to make things more sustainable or less

821
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,760
uh environmentally um you know damaging

822
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,679
and so we would like to work with the

823
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,559
wider community in collecting these data

824
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,519
sets building benchmarks building

825
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:53,120
challenges around this problem because I

826
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,559
think that's where the community needs

827
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,399
to go I'm hoping that the era of bigger

828
00:29:55,559 --> 00:30:00,480
and bigger and bigger models starts to

829
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:02,640
slow down it at least and we start to be

830
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,320
a little bit more uh you know start to

831
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,519
think more about well can we get the

832
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,880
same answer but add a little bit of

833
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,720
intelligence um to make it more energy

834
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,200
efficient so I want to uh just

835
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,679
acknowledge a number of folks who have

836
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,240
contributed to this work uh really any

837
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,440
mistakes I made are mine uh they did all

838
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,480
the the great work to be honest and look

839
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,760
forward to uh interacting with you all

840
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,799
and please reach out to me if there's

841
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,279
any opportunities to uh connect or
