1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,320
So so

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,000
let's recall where we were last time. So

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,640
we are trying to prove protection

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,560
theorem. I guess I will state it again

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,800
uh later. But uh last time we hopefully

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:33,320
accepted the following fact as true. Uh

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,320
okay. So maybe

8
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,440
if

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,200
a subset of 01

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,200
is a okay so given s

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,399
01

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,680
there exist

13
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:02,160
ea and epsilon positive depending on s

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:06,880
and if we have a set which is a an S

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:10,159
delta delta to the minus EA set

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:16,159
then there exist a little A in the set

17
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:18,720
such that the size of A plus little A a

18
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,759
grows by delta to the minus epsilon

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,759
compared to the size of A.

20
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,960
So Larry pointed out okay so initially

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,920
instead of this we have some polomial Q

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,920
of A such as AA minus AA. So Larry

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,680
pointed out to me that if you follow

24
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,720
exactly what you did in the finite field

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,479
setting to go from Q of A to this you

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,720
need to use the non-conentration

27
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,880
condition that we are trying to prove

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,680
but it is possible to do it in a way

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,479
which is not circular. So

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,479
okay so I said I was not going to cover

31
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,159
all of the details. So using pruning

32
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,360
corusa so pruning corusa is the main

33
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,840
tool and switchable double counting one

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,880
can really improve this without using

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,159
something that we haven't proved yet

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,679
okay and the goal is to improve this by

37
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,280
showing that a plus a satisfies a better

38
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,840
non concentration condition that will

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,200
allow us to iterate. So the goal is to

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,720
show that a plus a a actually contains

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,720
because

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,800
it is not true that it always is but it

43
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,840
contains

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,640
a delta s plus epsilon

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,760
delta to the minus

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,280
maybe let's call it prime

47
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,120
um set.

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,120
So the can get worse when one iterates

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,360
but one iterates finitely many times. So

50
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,519
this is not serious.

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:51,879
Okay. Um, okay. Maybe for a different So

52
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,879
the epsilon is also going to change.

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,879
Okay. So, um,

54
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,480
so suppose

55
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,000
so I'm basically going back to what I

56
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,800
did at the end of last time, but I was

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,080
rushing a bit. So I'm going to be a bit

58
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:19,280
more precise hopefully. Suppose that a

59
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:22,280
is a delta s delta to the minus ea squar

60
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,280
set.

61
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,800
Well in particular it is an s delta

62
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,800
delta to the minus

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,360
so I guess the delta goes first. Um in

64
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,040
particular it is it is a delta s delta

65
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,120
to the minus ita set because it is a

66
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,159
very small number. But why did I square

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:47,920
it? Because um then

68
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,400
it is okay. And as we saw last time, if

69
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,239
we take a subset of a which is uniform,

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,000
delta m uniform for some good choice of

71
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,799
delta, delta will have to be chosen

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,680
small enough in terms of EA but nothing

73
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,879
else.

74
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,879
uh then so we may assume

75
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,959
let's call it delta uniform

76
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,239
or delta

77
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,280
depends on ea so that basically this

78
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:27,120
doesn't change maybe one has to multiply

79
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,759
by two but essentially doesn't change

80
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,600
well then uh this uh set because it's

81
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,800
uniform now is also a row s

82
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,600
delta to the minus ea square

83
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,600
for every row

84
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,960
and then this implies that it is also a

85
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,240
row s row to the minus ea. So the

86
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,360
problem here is that now we have row

87
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,400
here but we still have delta here but we

88
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,280
replace it by it squared so that so that

89
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,560
we can have also row here

90
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:11,160
and this will be for every row

91
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,160
between delta and delta to the ea

92
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,840
right because we started with delta to

93
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,840
the minus ea squ

94
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,080
okay we don't go all the way to one but

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,800
almost it is very very small. So morally

96
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,800
this is almost one.

97
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,720
So from here to here we use the

98
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,680
uniformity. So one consequence of

99
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:46,240
uniformity that uh I explained last time

100
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:52,280
is that a uniform delta set is also a

101
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,280
row set for every row. And this is just

102
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,919
trivial inequality assume that row is at

103
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,919
most delta to the ea.

104
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,960
[Applause]

105
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,759
Okay. So this in this means that we can

106
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,840
apply what we already know for every

107
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,360
scale row between delta and delta 2

108
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,360
theta because it satisfies the

109
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,360
assumptions.

110
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,919
And another thing that I explained last

111
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,639
time is that even though a priority we

112
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,479
only know that there exists an a so that

113
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,319
a plus little aa grows by applying that

114
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,319
to the set of exceptions we get that

115
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,720
this is true for almost every a in a

116
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,039
strong sense. So if you put all of this

117
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,919
together,

118
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,919
what we get is that

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,039
okay so maybe let's recall what I just

120
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,360
said. So in fact um

121
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:57,120
the set of a

122
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,919
okay so let's work with some finite set

123
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,520
of rows which are powers of delta again.

124
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:07,440
So we have delta delta square

125
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,160
up to delta to some

126
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,039
maybe m prime. So that this is equal to

127
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,479
delta to the

128
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:19,199
recall that little delta is delta to the

129
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,599
m. So m prime is less than m but it is

130
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,599
close to m.

131
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,800
And again this is a

132
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,360
finite set of scales. Well, not really

133
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,680
finite because okay this it is finite

134
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,319
but it grows with delta but it grows

135
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,840
logarithmically with delta. So m is

136
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,039
logarithm

137
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,680
of little delta in base

138
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,400
delta. Big delta is fixed. So it's it's

139
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,919
logarithmic in delta and m prime is

140
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:54,360
smaller. So it's also logarithmic in

141
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:54,360
delta. Okay. So uh for each row

142
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:08,080
we know that the set of A's so that A

143
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:12,000
plus row A doesn't grow sorry little A

144
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:15,919
but measurement scale row doesn't grow

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,919
by row to the minus epsilon

146
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:28,680
has size at most row to the eater

147
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,680
times the size of a.

148
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,880
And why is this true? Because

149
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,880
uh if

150
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:45,120
this was not true then we could apply

151
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,360
the statement above to the scale row

152
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,000
to the set of exceptions to this set and

153
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,000
get the contradiction.

154
00:08:53,630 --> 00:09:11,970
[Applause]

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,680
Okay. And this is very small in terms of

156
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,560
delta. So row to the EA is at most delta

157
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,560
to the EA squar

158
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,160
sorry here.

159
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,480
Okay.

160
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,560
Okay. So here we are counting a set of

161
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,480
A's. So the only way in which we can

162
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,720
really count a set of A's is by

163
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,640
measuring it at some scale. otherwise

164
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,920
could be infinite. So we always have to

165
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,640
choose a scale. Um

166
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:58,760
so scale row okay row to the EA is at

167
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,760
most delta to the squared

168
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,000
and this means that um

169
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,240
sorry this is wrong.

170
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,040
Let's go back and fix it. So delta is is

171
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,839
is too large. So delta is a constant. So

172
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,240
I want to be away from one. Uh not away

173
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,240
from zero but away from one. So the rows

174
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,440
that we consider are delta to the m

175
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:34,399
delta to the which is little delta delta

176
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:38,120
to the m minus one. And then we stop at

177
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,120
delta to the ea.

178
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,959
Sorry about that.

179
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:51,279
Okay. because we are only looking at

180
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:53,120
logarithmically many um values of delta.

181
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,959
Okay, one has to work a little bit more

182
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,560
because here we are measuring things

183
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,959
that scale row but uh row is far away

184
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,640
from one

185
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,079
and there are only logarithmically many

186
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:10,120
values of row. So putting all together

187
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,120
what we get is that

188
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,040
for all aside

189
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:35,240
of a small set.

190
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,240
Maybe something like a set of size

191
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,519
delta to the ea

192
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,600
I don't know cubed times the size of a

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,320
we get that a plus little a grows for

194
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,320
every scale in this family.

195
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,839
Okay. And now it looks like we are

196
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,399
getting close because well we want to

197
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,399
show that this contains

198
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:30,000
a delta

199
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,240
s plus epsilon something set and a

200
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,880
necessary condition is that we have

201
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,279
growth at every scale.

202
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,399
So if you have a set with that, so if

203
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,600
you have a

204
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,839
delta s plus epsilon something set, then

205
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,639
this will be true.

206
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,040
And if we knew that this set is uniform,

207
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,040
we would be done because for a uniform

208
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,760
set, the condition of growing at every

209
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,120
scale is necessary and sufficient.

210
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,959
But we don't know that this set is

211
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,560
uniform.

212
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,040
So we are not done yet. So we are

213
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,480
getting closer, but we are not done yet.

214
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,000
Any questions? So, this is more or less

215
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,760
where we were last time.

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,079
Okay. So, in order to be able to finish,

217
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:20,560
we still have to work a bit and uh there

218
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:24,720
was a claim that there was explaining

219
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,519
last time that we can improve this. So

220
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,800
here we are projecting a * a. So this is

221
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,760
pi a of a * a. So we can improve this to

222
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,480
project an arbitrary dense subset of a *

223
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,480
a. So claim

224
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,279
uh if

225
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:46,560
g is contained in a * a and it has size

226
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,600
at scale delta let's say delta to the

227
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:55,079
square or something like this

228
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,079
relative to a * a then

229
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,480
pa of g

230
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,720
already grows

231
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,040
and in fact we this we will also want to

232
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,040
apply

233
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,959
at many scales or maybe not. We'll see.

234
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,519
Okay, let's start with scale delta. Then

235
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,440
we'll see what we actually need. Uh then

236
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,760
this already grows let's say by epsilon

237
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,760
/ two.

238
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,720
Okay. And I guess at this stage uh we

239
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,720
claim that there exists such an A.

240
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,880
But once again, if there exist an A,

241
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,560
then it is true for nearly all A by

242
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,199
applying the fact that there exists an A

243
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,959
to the exceptional set. So we can play

244
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,440
this game as many times as we want and

245
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,560
we want to play it many times.

246
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,320
Okay. So uh last time we were in the

247
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,199
middle of proving this. So let's start

248
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,040
the game. Uh assume that one is in a

249
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:58,160
this is just tool to okay just for

250
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,959
notation and simplicity it's not not

251
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,800
important.

252
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,320
Well, if a equals 1 works,

253
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,240
we are done because we are trying to

254
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,720
show that some some element of a works.

255
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,800
So, if the element one happens to work,

256
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,420
we are happy.

257
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,000
Otherwise,

258
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,240
[Applause]

259
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,800
one doesn't work. And the fact that one

260
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,580
doesn't work means that there exists G

261
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:30,789
which is dense in a * A

262
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:30,789
[Applause]

263
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:40,839
and such that pi 1 of G doesn't grow too

264
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,839
much.

265
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,800
And this okay the f so all of these

266
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,360
together are exactly the assumptions of

267
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,759
alumericic hours or rather the delta

268
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,000
covering number of Alexic hours but as I

269
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,120
explained a couple of lectures ago

270
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,920
valuic hours works exactly the same for

271
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,920
delta covering numbers.

272
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,639
So maybe let's recall

273
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:20,920
the hours for delta covering numbers. Um

274
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,360
if

275
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:31,440
uh a a scale delta has size n

276
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:37,320
and

277
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,320
there exists g contained in a * a

278
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,480
such that the size of g at scale delta

279
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:47,120
is at least 1 / k times the size of a

280
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:52,000
plus a at scale delta

281
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:55,279
And if we project in the direction one

282
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,360
the set g

283
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,079
uh this doesn't grow a lot compared to

284
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,839
the size of a.

285
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:06,480
If all of this is true then there exists

286
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,600
a set a prime contained in a which is

287
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:15,199
fairly dense. So the size of a at scale

288
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:18,240
delta is at least k to minus a constant

289
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:22,919
times the size of a

290
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,919
and a prime has a small subset.

291
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,960
The doubling constant for a prime is at

292
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:38,919
most k to a power to to a constant power

293
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,919
times the size of a prime.

294
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,440
Okay, this is valuic hours.

295
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, here we can take well n is just

296
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,120
the delta covering number of a and we

297
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,799
can take k to be the minimum between ea

298
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,799
square

299
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,880
delta to the minus ea square and delta

300
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,480
to the minus epsilon / two which is

301
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,919
really delta to the minus ea square. You

302
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,550
should imagine that is smaller than

303
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,000
epsilon even before squaring.

304
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:13,559
[Applause]

305
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,559
Okay. So we apply maluic hours

306
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,880
and let a prime

307
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,039
be the corresponding set.

308
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,679
Okay. And then uh

309
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,679
a prime is dense in a

310
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,320
and has more subset.

311
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,559
Okay. So, A prime is a dense subset of

312
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,080
A.

313
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:34,240
A is a delta S something set. So, A

314
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,160
prime is also a delta S something set

315
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,520
because we saw that subsets of delta S

316
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,919
something sets are delta S something

317
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,480
sets where the constant. So basically we

318
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,080
have to multiply the constant by this

319
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,960
but a was a delta s delta to the epsilon

320
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,600
square set. So this is still a delta s

321
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,360
delta to the minus o of epsilon square

322
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,080
set.

323
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:01,120
So we can apply what we know to a prime.

324
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:04,960
So a prime is a delta s delta to the

325
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,640
minus o of it square set.

326
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:13,919
So there exists a in a prime in a prime

327
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:16,919
sorry such that a prime plus a a prime

328
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,919
grows

329
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,000
by applying the fact from the beginning

330
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,000
to a prime. It still satisfies the

331
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,200
assumptions. We have lost a constant

332
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,200
here but this is harmless.

333
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Any

334
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,520
questions so far?

335
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,000
Okay. And now we apply something that

336
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,080
you've seen in the finite field setting.

337
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,640
And again, it works. This works exactly

338
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,320
in the same way for delta covering sets.

339
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,720
What you saw in the finite field setting

340
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,720
is that if you have a set with a small

341
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,559
sums set,

342
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,200
so small pi 1 projection and large pi a

343
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,720
projection,

344
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:10,480
then in fact the pi projection remains

345
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,440
large if we pass to a dense subset of a

346
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,240
prime time n prime.

347
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,679
Okay, so this is another recall from the

348
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,679
finite field story.

349
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:29,360
If a prime plus a prime let's say again

350
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:33,280
it goes by at most k

351
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,440
and a prime plus little a prime

352
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,919
let's say

353
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,440
so a prime has small doubling but if you

354
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,840
apply projection by a it grows by

355
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,080
something

356
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,120
then in fact this implies that for every

357
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:54,760
g in

358
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,760
a prime * a prime which is dense

359
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:04,760
let's say dense with threshold 1 / k

360
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,840
everything measured with delta covering

361
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,440
numbers

362
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,440
the projection is still large

363
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,640
and I think it's K to minus some

364
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,640
constant and DL basically survives.

365
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,960
Does this look like something you've

366
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,960
seen before?

367
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:50,000
Okay. Does it look like something that

368
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,200
Okay.

369
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,320
Well, go back to your notes and or

370
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,640
otherwise just believe me this is true.

371
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,640
Um Larry told me you've seen something

372
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,799
like this. Maybe with different letters

373
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,240
very likely with different letters. But

374
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,760
the point is you have a set with small

375
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,320
doubling but large PA projection. then

376
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,960
the PA projection is large even after

377
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,960
passing to a subset.

378
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,320
Okay, so it looks like we've almost won

379
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,600
because look at the claim

380
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:27,559
and look at what we have here.

381
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,559
Okay, have we really won?

382
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:34,240
Not exactly because the claim was for A

383
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,039
and we got it for A prime which is a

384
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,919
dense subset of A but it is not A. So

385
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:43,200
one has to work a bit to

386
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:46,799
really win but you will have to trust me

387
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,559
that one can win from here. So the claim

388
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,480
was that

389
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,960
what we obtained for a prime is true for

390
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,280
a

391
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,520
and we got it for a prime not for a. So

392
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,080
I will briefly explain how to get it for

393
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,760
a but I will not do all of the details

394
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:07,280
because otherwise we'll be here forever.

395
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:11,880
Uh maybe let's keep

396
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,880
the objective inside.

397
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,799
Okay, we can upgrade

398
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,360
a prime to a

399
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,640
and the idea

400
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:51,120
is well either a prime is a in which

401
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:53,200
case we win or if a prime is not all of

402
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,520
a but it is almost all of a in the sense

403
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,880
that a minus a prime is really small we

404
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,559
still win uh because

405
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,880
so if if the difference between a and a

406
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,559
prime is really small you just apply

407
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:09,080
trivial bounds on the very small part

408
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,080
and we still win. So

409
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,159
if a minus a prime is very small

410
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,760
very small maybe of size less than delta

411
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,159
to the plus e to something like this

412
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,360
times the size of a

413
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,360
we are fine otherwise

414
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,720
do the same so apply the same argument

415
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,240
to a minus a prime.

416
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,120
If a prime is not very dense in a, then

417
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,440
a minus a prime is still the delta is

418
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,279
delta to the minus theta square set. And

419
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,039
we can do the same and get a new a

420
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,960
prime.

421
00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:00,320
So maybe the original a prime we can

422
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,480
call it a prime one.

423
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,840
And if we apply the same thing, we get

424
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,120
an a prime two. Now uh at the same time

425
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,039
we have to play the game that if

426
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,840
something is true for one a is true for

427
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:14,640
nearly all a because we found that there

428
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,840
exist an a and there exist an a prime

429
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,400
but in fact there are lots of a but the

430
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,400
a prime could depend on a so one has to

431
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,279
be a little bit careful

432
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,120
but

433
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,559
but one can play this game and

434
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:33,840
eventually uh one gets

435
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:38,120
so all of these sets have large size

436
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,120
because they are dense in a prime.

437
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,600
Where is it? A prime is dense in A. So

438
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,600
at some point

439
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,440
and they are all disjointed. They are

440
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,840
all disjointed because we take away the

441
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,279
previous ones when we apply this again.

442
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,320
So at some point

443
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:05,320
we reach a step where

444
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,320
we have exhausted almost all of a

445
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,440
let's say something like this and then

446
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,679
we stop.

447
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,360
Okay, but I'm cheating here because

448
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,799
and then then we stop and then basically

449
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:25,039
we win because if we have a set G which

450
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:27,200
is dense in a in a * A. Okay. Uh we

451
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,400
still don't really win yet. But if a set

452
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,679
G is dense in A* A, it will be dense in

453
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,640
A I prime time A

454
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,559
G prime. Maybe a different prime. Okay,

455
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,480
so one still has to work. Okay, plus

456
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,480
some work plus more work.

457
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,559
And I'm basically ignoring a here, the

458
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,919
little a here. But it's okay to ignore

459
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,440
the little a because everything you

460
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,919
prove from one little a is true for

461
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,159
nearly all little a.

462
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,440
Maybe forget what I said. But okay, this

463
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,200
is one thing you have to do. Just

464
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,760
iterate.

465
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,000
So iterate this. Here we get a dense a

466
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,880
prime. We want to get all of a not the

467
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,200
dense a prime. We iterate plus some

468
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,039
double counting.

469
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,279
We get

470
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,279
that claim

471
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,279
any questions

472
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,200
so one has to work here so I I haven't

473
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,600
proved it so I don't expect you to see

474
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,120
the proof so one thing you have to do in

475
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,799
the proof is iterate but you have to do

476
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,200
more things and double count carefully

477
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:38,880
um but eventually one gets that so one

478
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,279
is able to upgrade a prime to a okay so

479
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,279
that claim is True.

480
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,600
So that claim says that there exists an

481
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,480
A and once there is one A there are many

482
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,640
A's nearly all A's. So that the pi A

483
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,039
projection of any dense subset of A plus

484
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,039
A grows

485
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:04,760
and now we are really close to the to

486
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,760
the end of that goal.

487
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:14,480
So a prime a plus a a plus little a a is

488
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,760
not necessarily uniform but we know that

489
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,240
it contains a uniform subset and when we

490
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,919
pass to a uniform subset we can make it

491
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,679
large

492
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:29,120
for any sub additive

493
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,960
function set function mu.

494
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,559
Okay, so this is the mu we are going to

495
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,520
use now. So mu of b

496
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:42,600
is going to be okay. So

497
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,600
fix little a for which the claim holds.

498
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,360
[Applause]

499
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,960
So this is the clean star. So we fix a

500
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:02,080
little a so that this holds

501
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,640
and then let mu of b and here b is a

502
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,039
subset of 01 so it's a subset of a

503
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,679
really

504
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:14,440
is the delta covering number not of b

505
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,440
but of pi a inverse of b.

506
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:30,159
So this is sub additive right because

507
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:33,039
what is mu of b1 union b2 well uh if you

508
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,320
take pre images

509
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,080
you get something which is contained in

510
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,760
the pre image of the in the in the union

511
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,000
of the pre images and then the delta

512
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,880
covering number is sub additive. Does

513
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,640
this mean pi a inverse of b intersect a

514
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:49,480
cross a?

515
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,480
>> Yes. Sorry. Thank you.

516
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,679
So this is finitely subjective

517
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,360
because delta covering number is

518
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,120
subjective and we are just taking delta

519
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,720
covering number together with the

520
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,720
pre-image which is already subjective.

521
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:27,080
Okay. So by lema from last time by the

522
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,080
uniformization lema from last time

523
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,919
there exists

524
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,919
an a prime contained in a

525
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,000
uh which is uniform.

526
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:52,399
Sorry, not in A. Ah, there existed B

527
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
contained in A plus little A A.

528
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,279
So we are going to apply uniformization

529
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,279
to A plus little A A.

530
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,840
We are trying to show that this set

531
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,799
contains a delta S plus epsilon set. So

532
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,600
this is our ultimate goal and we know

533
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,360
that if this set was uniform, it would

534
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,240
be enough to show that it grows at every

535
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,880
scale to reach the conclusion. So we

536
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,120
want to make it uniform but we need to

537
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,120
know that the uniform subset grows at

538
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,320
every scale.

539
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:29,919
Okay. So by uniformization there exist a

540
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:32,880
b in a plus e a such that this mu

541
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:37,000
of b is larger than delta to the minus

542
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,000
ea squar

543
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,960
times the measure of a + a a. And what

544
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:49,480
is the measure of a plus a a? This is

545
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,480
just the delta covering number of a * a.

546
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,080
Okay. So this is the delta covering

547
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:05,399
number

548
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,399
of pi a inverse of b.

549
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:13,159
So this is a sorry again I forgot to

550
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,159
intersect with a * a.

551
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,080
So this is the g to which we can apply

552
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:24,159
the claim.

553
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,240
So this is a dense subset of a * a.

554
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,880
And we know that for every dense subset

555
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,120
of a * a the pi a projection grows.

556
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,840
In particular, the pi a projection of

557
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,960
this grows. But this is pi a inverse. So

558
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,600
if we apply pi a we land in b and in

559
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,279
particular we land in a plus little aa

560
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,279
but in particular we land in b which is

561
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,279
uniform.

562
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,640
Okay. So apply

563
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,800
claim star

564
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:20,639
to g equals pi i inverse of b

565
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:24,119
intersection a * a is does satisfies the

566
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,119
density assumption

567
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,839
and this is because uniform sets can be

568
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,679
taken deaths. So again here I have to

569
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,679
choose maybe a different delta than

570
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,159
before although I guess the same delta

571
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,720
works because it's the same numerology.

572
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,720
So that this is true.

573
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,359
We can make we can take uniform sets

574
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,839
which are as dense in the exponential

575
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,399
sense as we want. This is exactly what's

576
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:52,159
going on here.

577
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:56,280
Okay. And the conclusion is that

578
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,280
the delta covering number

579
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,280
grows

580
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,280
sorry not by a b ah

581
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,400
by a of a *

582
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,520
intersected with B, I guess.

583
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,880
Okay. So, um,

584
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,839
okay. So now we are getting so we are

585
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:09,440
one step closer uh because now we have a

586
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:13,640
uniform subset of a * little a a

587
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,640
and the delta covering number

588
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,119
well I guess B is a subset of this. So

589
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,839
here one could have just B. So the delta

590
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,160
covering number grows.

591
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:31,520
We know that if a set is uniform and the

592
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,000
row covering number grows for every row

593
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,839
and in fact we don't need every row we

594
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,359
is enough to consider rows which are

595
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:46,640
powers of delta then they are h

596
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:49,200
delta s plus the growth set. So we just

597
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:53,920
repeat. So here we have something for

598
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,440
for delta but then um

599
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,079
okay let's see what is the right order

600
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,760
to do this. So I want to claim that what

601
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,599
we did for delta we can do for any

602
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,720
scale. So there is nothing special about

603
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:07,200
delta because a itself is uniform. All

604
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:11,200
of this that we did for delta we can do

605
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,880
it for any other scale uh row.

606
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:18,839
But uh the uniform set that we get can

607
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,839
depend on the scale.

608
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,359
So what is the right order to do this?

609
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,760
So the goal is to use the lema from last

610
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,680
time that says that if it is uniform and

611
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,760
the row covering number is large for

612
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,440
every row and in fact one doesn't need

613
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,040
every every row. It's enough to consider

614
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,560
powers of the delta based in the

615
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,320
uniformity.

616
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,640
then it is a delta s set where the s

617
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,720
comes from the size of the row covering

618
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:54,240
numbers

619
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:56,960
and okay by using this idea for every

620
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,200
row so we did it with for delta but the

621
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,720
assumptions hold for every row at least

622
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:05,079
for every row which is not very close to

623
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,079
one so we can do the same

624
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,760
uh the only danger is that we could get

625
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,480
a different b for different rows we

626
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,480
could get different beasts.

627
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:37,240
And I'm not very happy about this. So,

628
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,240
how do we deal with this?

629
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,400
One thing one could try to do but I

630
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,720
think we lose too much is okay delta is

631
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,359
delta to the m. Now we want to go to

632
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,280
delta to the m minus one. So we could

633
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,160
just replace

634
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,160
a plus little a by b.

635
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,839
But then we will have another subset of

636
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,160
b and we are going to lose this factor

637
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:02,640
logarithmically many times and that is

638
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:07,960
too many times. So yeah I don't want to

639
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,960
do that. I will lose too much. Um,

640
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,640
okay. So, there is something I'm missing

641
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,839
and I'm not going to figure it out right

642
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,960
now. So, uh, because I told you that

643
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,960
Yes.

644
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,280
>> Um, can you prove the claim

645
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,160
simultaneously for all scales, replace

646
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,119
that delta by rows, all the different

647
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,359
rows, and then then I think that would

648
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,119
fix it.

649
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,000
>> Yeah. You want to have the same G for

650
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,560
every scale.

651
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,760
>> Yes.

652
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,280
>> Yeah. uh

653
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,400
>> if you conclude that's stronger claim

654
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,480
then it will solve

655
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,599
>> yes but why can't we get the same G for

656
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,520
for all the scales

657
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,200
okay because I told you I wouldn't give

658
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,119
a complete proof and just a sketch of

659
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,599
some of the ideas well here is a sketch

660
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,800
of some of the ideas and is is something

661
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,520
technical that so really the ideas are

662
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,240
what I explained and what I'm missing is

663
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,200
something technical it's not

664
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,960
fundamental I would

665
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,599
just to summarize what's been what's

666
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,920
been going on. I still have to explain

667
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,760
once we prove that goal how to continue

668
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,320
with the rest of bans the proof of the

669
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,160
rest of bans theorem but really this is

670
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,160
really the most difficult step where

671
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,880
things really change from the final

672
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,720
field setting okay so let me uh

673
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,000
sort of briefly explain again everything

674
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,400
that's been going on uh so we know that

675
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,079
a plus a grows but we want to show that

676
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,320
it also satisfies a stronger

677
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,079
non-conentration assumption that the S

678
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,920
in the non-conentration assumption also

679
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,480
grows.

680
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,119
Okay, first we can take A to be uniform.

681
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,119
If A is uniform, then we know that A

682
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:51,359
itself is a row set for every row. And

683
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,280
this allows us to reach conclusions for

684
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,839
every scale row, which is something that

685
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,599
we have to use in the step that I'm

686
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,119
missing as well. We use it we used it

687
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,599
before, but clearly we have to use it

688
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,000
again.

689
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,280
And then we know that a plus little aa

690
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,040
grows at every scale. If it was true

691
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,880
that a plus little a a was uniform

692
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,720
then we would win because for uniform

693
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,119
sets we saw last time that if they are

694
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,800
large at every scale then they satisfy

695
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,800
the corresponding non-conentration

696
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,800
condition.

697
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:29,520
So we have to take a large uniform

698
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,920
subset of a but large with respect to

699
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,000
what? Well, large respect to this

700
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,440
because this is what allows what allow

701
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,480
us to use the fact that if we project

702
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,079
something dense in a time a then we grow

703
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,960
and how do we know that if project

704
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,760
something dense in a time a then we grow

705
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,599
we have to combine two things firstic

706
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,839
hours and valid hours. So for valued

707
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,240
hours we just take an arbitrary element

708
00:41:53,839 --> 00:42:00,079
of a in this case we took one but it can

709
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,920
be an arbitrary element of a we apply

710
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,000
hours. So either that element already

711
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,560
works and we are done for that go for

712
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,480
the claim star or if it doesn't work

713
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,240
then we are under the assumptions of

714
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,319
valuic hours. we apply valuic hours and

715
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,240
then we end up with the set that

716
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,359
satisfies the assumption of something

717
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,119
else that you've seen in the finite

718
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,359
field setting which is that if you have

719
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,760
a very small subset an expansion under

720
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:26,079
pi a then this expansion under pa is

721
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,680
robust under passing two subsets. So in

722
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:33,119
either case we get that pi a of d subset

723
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:36,560
of a * a is large and this allows us to

724
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:39,040
use uniformity with this mu.

725
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:43,359
So that's a bit of a summary of the main

726
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:47,119
steps to show the goal.

727
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,119
Okay. Plus technical details

728
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,119
I can recall right now. Sorry about

729
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,119
that.

730
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:02,040
Uh this implies the goal.

731
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,040
the goal that goal.

732
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,079
Okay. Why did you spend so much time

733
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:14,000
towards this goal? Because now we can

734
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:16,400
iterate. We knew that if a is a delta s

735
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,800
delta to the minus epsilon set, then a

736
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,119
plus a a grows. But not only it grows,

737
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,319
it contains a delta s plus epsilon delta

738
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,000
to the minus ita prime set. And then we

739
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:30,560
can iterate.

740
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:33,560
So a plus little a is our new

741
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,560
a.

742
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,599
So iterating

743
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,800
a goes to a plus little a

744
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:53,680
for every epsilon uh maybe let's not

745
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,240
call it epsilon for every toao

746
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,680
there exist a polomial that depends on

747
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:02,480
toao is a very large degree if tow is

748
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:08,319
close to zero

749
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:11,520
such that qa of A is a delta

750
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:15,200
1 minus toao. So the s can become

751
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:18,400
arbitrarily close to one.

752
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,760
Delta to the minus some eat tilda that

753
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:26,520
depends on how many times we have to

754
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,520
iterate set and by is I mean contains.

755
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,680
Yes,

756
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,680
>> you said that epsilon is going to change

757
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,240
a

758
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,319
>> yeah I think instead of epsilon is

759
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,000
epsilon over two

760
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,760
>> so but then if the epsilons are

761
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,480
shrinking how are you getting arbitrary

762
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,400
close to

763
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,800
>> yeah that's a good question so epsilon

764
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,839
okay epsilon in some sense is shrinking

765
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,839
but okay so there there is one epsilon

766
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,480
which is the epsilon for the size of a

767
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:58,400
plus little aa and there is potentially

768
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,640
a different epsilon

769
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,599
If we want to find a delta s plus

770
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,200
epsilon set inside a plus little aa

771
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,920
those two epsilons I think one is

772
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,599
epsilon the other is epsilon / two but

773
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,400
the point is that they depend on s

774
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,079
continuously both of them

775
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,240
so they are continuous they can be taken

776
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,480
to be continuous functions of s because

777
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:22,240
they are continuous functions of s as

778
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:25,520
long as s is less than 1 minus toao s is

779
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:29,200
bounded away from zero so we reach 1

780
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,200
minus towa in finitely many steps

781
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,119
Maybe let's write this here because it's

782
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,319
important. So epsilon

783
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,319
is or can be taken continuous

784
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,040
uh function of

785
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,040
s.

786
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,040
So remains

787
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:53,800
bounded below

788
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:03,960
as long as s is bounded away from one.

789
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,860
So we can do we can achieve this by

790
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:16,039
iterating finally many times.

791
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,039
[Applause]

792
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,680
Okay. And why is this good? Because this

793
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:25,920
allows us to do instead of a plus little

794
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:30,839
a a now we can do x plus little ax where

795
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,839
x is potentially much bigger than a.

796
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:36,319
[Applause]

797
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,319
So the next step

798
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,920
and I think this step is the same as in

799
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:44,400
define a field setting. So I'm basically

800
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:51,480
just going to state it. Uh if x

801
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:51,480
is a delta t uh okay x in 01 still

802
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:59,920
and x is a delta

803
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,520
uh maybe let's call it u. So u is going

804
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:06,520
to be t / 2 soon. uh delta minus epsilon

805
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,520
set

806
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,839
and a

807
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,839
is 01

808
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:20,160
is a delta s maybe let's write ea here

809
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,480
for consistency delta to the minus ea

810
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,800
set. So now instead of one set we have

811
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,800
two sets potentially of very different

812
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,440
sizes and okay they are both strictly

813
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:36,160
bigger than zero and strictly less than

814
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:39,280
one and the interesting case

815
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:43,720
is when s is less than u. So this is the

816
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,720
case that that we don't already know.

817
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:57,079
Then there exists little a in a

818
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:57,079
such that x plus little ax grows.

819
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:07,319
It grows by some epsilon that depends on

820
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,319
s and u

821
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,640
Okay. So uh just briefly so the idea and

822
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,359
again I think you've seen this in the

823
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,280
final setting but the idea is that it's

824
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:30,000
true

825
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:33,040
for

826
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,040
maybe not for a but is true for Q to of

827
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,040
a

828
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:47,119
and here you have to take toao uh so

829
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:50,079
that q to a is bigger than X.

830
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:52,480
So we can take toao for example to be 1

831
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,359
- U / 2

832
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:59,040
something like this. Then this is much

833
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:02,640
bigger than X in size. So these are sets

834
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:06,000
but it has size much bigger than X. Once

835
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,760
once uh the set of directions has size

836
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,119
much bigger than X we can do double

837
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:13,280
counting and get growth with this

838
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,119
instead of this. But once we get growth

839
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,760
for a polomial instead of a we apply

840
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:21,160
pruna one million times and we go back

841
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,160
down to a.

842
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:32,559
Okay. and then apply

843
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,520
plunic

844
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:38,920
triangle inequality

845
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,920
double counting

846
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,760
and then it is also true for a.

847
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:55,280
So this part is really exactly the same.

848
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:59,440
So we already had to go from Q of A to

849
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:01,839
to little A uh before. So initially we

850
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,079
proved that A a minus A a is bigger than

851
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:06,480
A and we use that to show that A plus

852
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,200
little A is bigger than A. So it's the

853
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,559
same the same reduction here and I think

854
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,720
you've seen something very similar in

855
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,040
the finite field setting and modular

856
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,760
technical details. This part is the

857
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:20,240
same.

858
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,440
But in order to get here, it's important

859
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:27,480
that we can make this set bigger than x.

860
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,480
This is what we wanted to iterate.

861
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:33,200
Potentially x is much bigger than a. But

862
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,520
we can expand a by a polomial so that it

863
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,240
becomes bigger than x. And for this we

864
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:41,880
have to iterate. This is why we worried

865
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,880
so much about iterating.

866
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:47,119
Okay.

867
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:51,200
[Applause]

868
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:55,400
Okay, the next step is to

869
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,400
prove Bans projection theorem.

870
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,920
Okay, I'm not going to do the whole

871
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,240
proof, but just basically recall what it

872
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,800
is in the final setting and explain

873
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:08,160
again where one where one has to be a

874
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,760
little bit careful, but hopefully by now

875
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,000
you will not be so worried about the

876
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:16,200
part where we have to be careful. So

877
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,200
proof of region theorem.

878
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:24,079
Okay. Now I regret calling this xx but

879
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:30,839
it's too late.

880
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:30,839
So let x be uh in the unit b 2

881
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:38,319
delta t delta t the minus ea set where

882
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:41,800
ea is very very small and t is between

883
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:41,800
zero and two.

884
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,119
Let d be a set of directions

885
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:58,440
which is a delta s delta to the minus ea

886
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,440
set

887
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,559
and what is the goal?

888
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,359
So what is the claim of protection

889
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,440
theorem? It is that there exists some a

890
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:15,920
in d

891
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:19,240
such that pi a

892
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,240
of g

893
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:26,599
exceeds the trivial bound by some

894
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:26,599
epsilon

895
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,640
and the trivial bound is the

896
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
square root of the delta. Okay, sorry.

897
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:42,160
In the version we are that I stated the

898
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:46,440
size of X is delta to the minus T. So it

899
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,440
matches the non concentration condition.

900
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,440
So here we can just write delta t the

901
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,200
minus t / two. This is the square root

902
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,359
of the size of x which is the trivial

903
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,920
bound and we exceed it by some delta to

904
00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:03,000
the minus epsilon. And this is true for

905
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,000
every g which is dense in a * a.

906
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,559
Okay. So this is projection theorem.

907
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,280
This is what we want to prove.

908
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:18,240
Okay. So uh in the finite setting I

909
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:21,599
think to prove a similar statement uh

910
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:26,240
what you did is first consider three fix

911
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:29,440
well just pick three directions in D

912
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,960
in order to apply hours. So again it's

913
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,200
similar to what we did before. Either

914
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,280
things already work or we can apply

915
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,079
hours. Here we have to be careful about

916
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,520
how we choose the three directions.

917
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,440
Uh because if the three directions that

918
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,200
we choose are very close to each other

919
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,839
uh this is going to be bad news. We are

920
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:49,599
going to lose a lot.

921
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:53,319
So um well even though this is in 01 we

922
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,319
can sort of change coordinates

923
00:53:56,090 --> 00:53:59,159
[Applause]

924
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:09,599
so that 0 1 and infinity are in D

925
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:12,000
and this can be done in a way where we

926
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:15,119
don't lose too much using that D is

927
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,559
spread out

928
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,160
Because of these non-conentration

929
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,680
conditions,

930
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,240
there are three points in D which are

931
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,760
far apart from each other. But that

932
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,440
means that if we send these three points

933
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,000
that are far apart from each other to 0,

934
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,520
one infinity. So the are really the

935
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:35,480
slopes. They are not the angles, they

936
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:35,480
are slopes. So uh so this can be done

937
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,079
with a linear change of coordinates.

938
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,240
of distortion.

939
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:56,079
So the distortion is the norm of the

940
00:54:53,680 --> 00:55:00,319
corresponding matrix

941
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:02,640
delta to the minus O of EA.

942
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:04,800
So this distortion is because EA is much

943
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,280
smaller than epsilon.

944
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,960
If we have a gain,

945
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,079
well we have to decrease the gain by

946
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:14,440
what we lose in this range of

947
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,440
coordinates. But this is mild.

948
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:24,519
[Applause]

949
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:31,760
>> A to be like pi 0

950
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,680
x.

951
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,240
>> We Yeah, we are going to look at the

952
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:39,359
vertical and horizontal projections of x

953
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:43,359
and and the the pi one of x. Yeah, I'm

954
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:47,319
just saying there's X and A in the

955
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,319
>> Oh, sorry. Uh,

956
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,160
>> sorry. In X in X. Sorry.

957
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:58,599
>> X

958
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,599
in X. X. X is in R2

959
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,480
>> in X.

960
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,599
>> X is in X is a two dimensional object.

961
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:08,640
>> And the point is you want to try to

962
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:11,040
prove this using a= 0 infinity X.

963
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,760
Yes. Yeah, that's the point. But yeah,

964
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,319
so sorry there was a typo here. So x is

965
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,920
already two dimensional in what we have

966
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:20,799
been doing. We have a cartitionian

967
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,680
product or here we have a cartitionian.

968
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:26,480
Okay, bad board management again. Now

969
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:28,559
it's hidden. So okay, we want to apply

970
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,760
this which unfortunately is going to be

971
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:34,079
hidden. Okay, so x this x is going to be

972
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:37,050
some like the projection of x horizontal

973
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:39,200
projection of the x in R2.

974
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:40,720
[Applause]

975
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,880
So it's really similar to the final

976
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,400
field setting. So I'm I'm going to I'm

977
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,480
skipping details. I'm going to continue

978
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,319
skipping details mostly focusing on the

979
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,319
differences. So one difference is that

980
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:52,240
we have to be careful with the three

981
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:54,400
directions that we take. If they are too

982
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:57,200
close to each other, the distortion will

983
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:59,200
be too large and we will it can be so

984
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,760
large that we lose all the gain. But

985
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,359
because the set of directions is spread

986
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,720
out by the non-conentration condition,

987
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:08,079
we can do it in such a way that the

988
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,079
distortion is controlled.

989
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:27,839
Okay. So now x is contained in x1 * x2

990
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,520
where this is the

991
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:32,920
horizontal projection and this is the

992
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,920
vertical projection.

993
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:41,119
So uh if because we are assuming that

994
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:47,040
also one

995
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:48,480
is in d. If one works we are done

996
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,720
because we are trying to show that

997
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,640
something works. So the claim is that

998
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,760
there exist an a and d with this

999
00:57:52,640 --> 00:58:00,040
property. So if we are so lucky that one

1000
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:00,040
has this property we are done.

1001
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:08,720
if one doesn't work.

1002
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:10,640
So this is very similar to what we did a

1003
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,880
bit earlier but somehow we have to do it

1004
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:15,280
twice. Once to do the iteration for a

1005
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,160
plus e aa and then again to conclude the

1006
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:21,040
proof. If one doesn't work then there

1007
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:25,480
exists some g

1008
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:25,480
which is dense in x1 * x2.

1009
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:32,599
Okay, sorry. Why is it dancing X1?

1010
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:32,599
Ah,

1011
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,400
okay. Actually, uh,

1012
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:44,040
yeah, this is more complicated. So, one

1013
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,040
has to be careful. So, okay. So, um,

1014
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:55,599
okay. So I want to assume that X1

1015
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:58,960
has size roughly square root of the size

1016
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:02,720
of X with the idea that if he had size

1017
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,799
bigger than the size of X we would win.

1018
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,880
But in fact in order to reach this

1019
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:09,760
conclusion we have to apply the G

1020
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:14,480
already because the conclusion we want

1021
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:16,480
is not only that the projection of X

1022
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:20,319
grows but the projection of every dense

1023
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:22,960
subset of X works. So

1024
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:24,559
okay so what one really has to do is

1025
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,599
apply

1026
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:29,520
hours three times. So for zero one and

1027
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:34,480
maybe for zero infinity and one in this

1028
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:36,880
order either it works or we apply

1029
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,520
hours

1030
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,319
to replace x by x prime and then xp

1031
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:46,079
prime and then x triple prime. Okay, I'm

1032
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:48,880
not going to do all of the details, but

1033
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,160
uh

1034
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,079
did something like this happen in the

1035
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:53,680
final field setting? I think it also

1036
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,240
this part has to be done in the final

1037
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,440
field setting.

1038
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,839
So

1039
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,359
>> we didn't we didn't do this stronger

1040
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:02,960
version in detail.

1041
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:04,799
>> Oh, okay. So you didn't do the strong

1042
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,119
version in detail. Okay. Uh also I'm not

1043
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:09,359
going to do the strong version in detail

1044
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,880
uh because the 20 minutes I expected to

1045
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:13,920
take are turning into the whole lecture

1046
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,599
again. Uh but I'm leaving today. So now

1047
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:24,240
I really have to finish it over the next

1048
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:27,839
20 minutes. So okay so we okay either

1049
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:29,359
zero one or infinity or I guess zero

1050
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:31,520
infinity

1051
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,359
or one

1052
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,040
work

1053
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:38,520
or

1054
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,520
in each case

1055
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,960
we can apply

1056
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:47,960
valuetic words

1057
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:54,200
and pass to subs to dense subsets of X

1058
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:05,240
of X and the corresponding projections

1059
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,240
of X.

1060
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,760
So evalu

1061
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:16,960
if the horizontal projection

1062
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,799
has the property we want, we are done.

1063
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,280
Otherwise, there exist a dense subset of

1064
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:22,640
a with a small horizontal projection.

1065
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,480
But we can imagine that the horizontal

1066
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,720
projection is some other projection. So

1067
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,839
it's the same thing we did last time uh

1068
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:32,400
we did a bit earlier and then we have to

1069
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:34,640
replace x by some x prime and then by

1070
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:38,520
some xp prime and then by some x triple

1071
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,520
prime. So

1072
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,280
I'm not going to do it in detail. I'm

1073
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,680
sorry. Yeah, I see many of you are

1074
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,920
confused and that's okay because uh one

1075
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,400
has to do it carefully. It's not obvious

1076
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:53,799
how to do it but it can be done. Okay.

1077
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,799
Okay. So eventually

1078
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,480
after renaming the set back to X,

1079
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:08,040
we are in the following situation.

1080
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:19,799
This situation where

1081
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,799
Okay, let me just write it here.

1082
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:26,280
where the horizontal and vertical

1083
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,280
projections

1084
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:35,880
have size at most delta to the minus

1085
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,880
epsilon t / 2 + epsilon.

1086
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:53,839
Okay, I guess um let's say we apply

1087
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:57,720
valuic hours twice. Uh so we don't apply

1088
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:57,720
to pi one yet.

1089
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:10,960
Okay. And just to see how this goes. So

1090
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:12,880
suppose that uh pi one

1091
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,119
So suppose that one doesn't work.

1092
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:21,079
Suppose that one doesn't work. And that

1093
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:21,079
means that pi 1 of g uh doesn't grow

1094
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:27,440
for some dense subset of x.

1095
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:30,559
And if it's a dense subset of x, it is a

1096
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:33,720
dense subset of x1 * x2. This is x1.

1097
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,720
This is x2.

1098
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:53,720
So this is x1, this is x2.

1099
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:01,680
Okay. Then we can apply valuic hours. So

1100
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,160
here you see that we are in the setting

1101
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:08,160
to apply hours. So we're going to apply

1102
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:10,319
hours. Okay. So uh it looks like after

1103
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,480
applying barometric hours lots of times

1104
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:14,559
and I skipped the details but you have

1105
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,240
to trust me that this can be done. We

1106
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:19,359
are in the setting where we can apply

1107
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:22,240
this and be done

1108
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:27,160
but not so fast.

1109
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:27,160
What's the issue? Why not so fast?

1110
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,720
So all of the part that I'm not

1111
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,480
explaining here, you also have to do it

1112
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,359
in the finite field setting. If you want

1113
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:38,000
to get the stronger statement that the

1114
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:40,480
projection of a dense subset grows, not

1115
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,599
then subset of the of the given set. If

1116
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,799
you want to prove that in the final

1117
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:45,520
field setting, you have to do this

1118
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:46,880
multiple values hours. So this is not a

1119
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,039
difference. Okay, you haven't done it in

1120
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,880
detail in the finite field setting. But

1121
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:52,559
this part is not a difference between

1122
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,079
the finite field setting and the ukian

1123
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,760
setting.

1124
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,000
But there is something which is a

1125
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:00,480
difference. So what what is the issue?

1126
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,079
Why can't we just apply? Okay, we we can

1127
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:06,200
apply this but why do we have to be

1128
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:06,200
careful about applying this?

1129
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:18,240
>> Yes.

1130
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:22,079
So if I balance separated we get like a

1131
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:24,000
prime cross a prime and then

1132
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,880
or

1133
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,720
call y cross y that covers a lot of g

1134
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,319
and then if I want to apply what's on

1135
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:33,119
the left board I would need to know that

1136
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:36,480
y is a delta u something x

1137
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:38,799
>> exactly so here we have a cartition

1138
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:41,760
product okay so one small issue is that

1139
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:44,240
instead of x1 * x1 we have x1 * x2 but

1140
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:48,400
this is not important the issue is that

1141
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:51,039
x1 One is a projection of X and we are

1142
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,920
assuming that the size is roughly the

1143
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:55,920
square root of the size of X. But why is

1144
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,079
it not concentrated? In order to apply

1145
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:01,039
this and conclude, we need to know that

1146
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:04,039
X is non concentrated with U equals to T

1147
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:04,039
/2.

1148
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,280
So it's is very similar to the issue

1149
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:11,839
that we had when we we needed to

1150
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:14,880
iterate. So we knew that a plus little

1151
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:16,240
aa is large but we didn't know that the

1152
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,599
non concentration condition also

1153
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:21,200
improves. It's a similar issue here. We

1154
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,520
know something about the size of these

1155
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:26,960
projections but apparently we don't know

1156
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:28,640
anything about the non concentration.

1157
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:31,920
We need these projections to be non

1158
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:34,319
concentrated. Okay. So

1159
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:37,039
maybe ignore all of these and just say

1160
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:39,839
the following. Using balmic hours many

1161
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:42,960
times in a clever way, we can reduce to

1162
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:44,799
the to the case where the set X is a

1163
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,720
product set. You can even assume it's a

1164
01:06:44,799 --> 01:06:50,400
product set of something a self product

1165
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:53,440
set. So using many times we can assume

1166
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:58,079
that X is X1 * X2

1167
01:06:53,440 --> 01:07:00,160
and then using again.

1168
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:02,319
So BIC hours allows us to go back and

1169
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:04,880
forth between dense subsets and test

1170
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:07,440
everything. So this is what what allows

1171
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,839
us to do. So we can assume that this we

1172
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,160
are in a in in in a the setting of a

1173
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:13,680
product set and then we want to apply

1174
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,920
this

1175
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:17,920
but not so fast because we don't know

1176
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,000
that the projections satisfy the

1177
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,240
concentration assumption of priority. So

1178
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,240
we have this problem again. So it's very

1179
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:27,359
similar to the problem we had before and

1180
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:31,119
it is solved in a similar way but it has

1181
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:33,920
to be solved. So in some sense so you

1182
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:36,880
can think of it of it in this way. We

1183
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:40,000
say that t /2 is a triv trivial between

1184
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:41,440
codes bound for projections. What we

1185
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,359
have to show is that this trivial bound

1186
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:46,000
actually holds in the non-conentration

1187
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:48,799
sense.

1188
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,680
So we have to show that the projection.

1189
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:54,319
So here 0 1 and infinity are just

1190
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:57,920
generic projections. So we in fact if we

1191
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:59,760
picture three random points uh in D this

1192
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,240
will work because three random points

1193
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,400
will be separated. Three random points

1194
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:07,520
will not be too concentrated because of

1195
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:09,920
this. There are not too many points in

1196
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:12,559
in a single ball. So if you randomly

1197
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:14,559
sample three points in D

1198
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,799
the linear map that makes these points

1199
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:19,839
horizontal, vertical and diagonal will

1200
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:22,480
have small distortion.

1201
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:27,839
So we need to know that the random

1202
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:29,920
projection of X is a delta T /2 S set.

1203
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:32,400
In some sense the goal is to show that

1204
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:35,440
the random projection is a delta T /2

1205
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:37,839
plus some gain S set.

1206
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:39,920
But to prove that we need to show that

1207
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:42,080
it satisfies the same thing but without

1208
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,080
the epsilon but the nonconentration

1209
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,839
version of that.

1210
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:48,640
And this can be done. It can be done in

1211
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:51,199
several ways. One way is a similar thing

1212
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:54,000
to what we have done today.

1213
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:59,319
Well today and last time but basically

1214
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,319
go from growth to non-conentration

1215
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:03,279
uh by uniformizing everything uh

1216
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,199
carefully

1217
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:07,600
and it can also be done by some careful

1218
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:08,960
double counting similar to but not

1219
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,120
exactly the same that you've done

1220
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,440
before. So there are several ways of

1221
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:16,400
doing it because it's like the easy case

1222
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:21,000
but but it has to be done. Okay. So

1223
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:21,000
maybe let's write that down.

1224
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:31,380
[Applause]

1225
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:38,120
Okay, so we need a last fact.

1226
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:50,239
If x and d are

1227
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:54,600
as before

1228
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:54,600
as in bulans projection theorem

1229
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:00,239
then there exists some a and d and once

1230
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:02,560
again once there is one once we know

1231
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:05,360
that there is one a and d that means

1232
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:12,159
nearly all a and d have this property

1233
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:14,400
such that by a of x contains a delta t

1234
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:18,560
/2

1235
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:21,560
Delta 2 maybe all of epsilon or va

1236
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:21,560
set

1237
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:30,239
again t /2 is like the trivial bound but

1238
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,760
it's not so trivial in this case because

1239
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:34,080
we are claiming some non-conentration

1240
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,480
for the projection but because at the

1241
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:38,880
same time

1242
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:40,640
for covering number so for the covering

1243
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,199
number version of this is is sort of

1244
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,560
obvious because again if we have one set

1245
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,560
you look at two projections

1246
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,640
in more or less orthogonal directions

1247
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,480
and most one of them can drop by more

1248
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,360
than square root of the size of the set

1249
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:54,960
and this is true at every scale.

1250
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:57,120
So you see that if we knew that this is

1251
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,640
uniform we would be done. So it's really

1252
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:02,400
very similar to what we have been

1253
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:04,950
discussing in the rest of the lecture.

1254
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:08,020
So this can be proved

1255
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:08,020
[Applause]

1256
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:14,920
using

1257
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:14,920
a similar strategy

1258
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:23,600
as for

1259
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:27,560
a plus little aa or it can also be done

1260
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,560
without using uniformization

1261
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:34,400
by double counting. So okay

1262
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,159
uh I guess one needs uniform some okay

1263
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,760
maybe not uniformization but if one

1264
01:11:36,159 --> 01:11:40,800
doesn't use uniformization maybe one is

1265
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:43,760
some sort of frostman's lema but okay so

1266
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:46,719
it can be done but I just wanted to

1267
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,400
point out that this is yet another place

1268
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,560
where we need to worry about the fact

1269
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:53,199
that so the difference between the

1270
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:57,120
uklidian setting and the final field

1271
01:11:53,199 --> 01:11:58,960
setting okay

1272
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:02,320
and now once we know this we are really

1273
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:04,800
done because using balance

1274
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:06,480
three times we can assume that x is a

1275
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,719
cartitionian product and we just need to

1276
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,960
know that the projection uh in a given

1277
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:13,960
direction grows and it is given by

1278
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:13,960
Listen,

1279
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:37,800
[Applause]

1280
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,800
hey,

1281
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:42,249
[Applause]

1282
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:48,360
And then uh we apply double star.

1283
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,640
Okay. So since there are five minutes

1284
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:16,080
left, let me summarize what what's been

1285
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:18,080
going on. So what is the idea of like

1286
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,679
general idea of the proof both in the

1287
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:23,120
finite field setting and the nuclear

1288
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:26,000
setting? First we work with the set in

1289
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:27,840
one dimension and shows that if the set

1290
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,400
is not already everything then is

1291
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:34,159
expanded by some polomial. Then we

1292
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:36,640
simplify the polomial using plunicus.

1293
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:38,560
Then we iterate. In order to iterate one

1294
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,800
has to be much much much more careful in

1295
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:43,280
the uklidian setting in order to show

1296
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:46,640
that the hypothesis of the expansion are

1297
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:48,960
satisfied when we apply the growth once.

1298
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:51,199
So we can iterate but eventually we can

1299
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,199
iterate that means that we can expand

1300
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:56,560
the given set a to almost everything by

1301
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:58,960
some polomial. Once we can expand by a

1302
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,719
polinomial to almost everything we get

1303
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,280
this growth.

1304
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:05,040
It is still of some product type but the

1305
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:07,760
difference is that X now can be much

1306
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,840
bigger than A. And the fact that X is

1307
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,760
much bigger than A is not an issue

1308
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:15,040
because instead of working with A, we

1309
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:18,320
work with a polomial applied to A which

1310
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:20,880
has size bigger than the size of X. And

1311
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:23,440
finally uh we want to project something

1312
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,760
which is not a product but by looking at

1313
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:27,520
three projections to begin with which

1314
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,760
are far away from each other and

1315
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:32,880
applying bioicical hours many times we

1316
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:35,040
can go back to this setting.

1317
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,440
So that's the short version of the proof

1318
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:40,159
and they are again in the ukian setting

1319
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:41,679
one has to be careful to show that the

1320
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:46,560
projections

1321
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:49,840
uh satisfy the assumptions needed to

1322
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:51,920
apply this fact. So you have to be so

1323
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:54,320
really you need some at least some non

1324
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,480
concentration on x because again if x

1325
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:59,280
was a small interval

1326
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:01,920
then this never grows for any a so one

1327
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:03,840
needs some assumption on x. So one needs

1328
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:06,239
to prove something like that. But okay,

1329
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,640
one can prove it and then eventually one

1330
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:12,360
uses this.

1331
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,360
Any final questions?

1332
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,520
>> How many times have we used PSG?

1333
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,520
>> Uh

1334
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:28,400
so either four or six. I'm not

1335
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,600
completely sure. Uh I think no. I think

1336
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,480
the first time we already have a

1337
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:36,640
product. Yeah, I think once for a plus

1338
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:38,719
little aa and then three times

1339
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:41,199
uh to reduce to this setting.

1340
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:43,600
>> Okay. Like

1341
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:46,719
is it for like well we just want the

1342
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:50,320
projection of like x itself is big in

1343
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:53,679
one direction or it's like for the proof

1344
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:56,159
that's for any subs.

1345
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:58,719
>> Yeah. Okay. So indefinitely setting is

1346
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:00,800
as you are suggesting is much easier to

1347
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:03,679
prove that the projection of X itself is

1348
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,840
big than proving it for dense subsets.

1349
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:07,360
But in the ukidian case even if your

1350
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,280
goal is to pro is proving that the

1351
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:11,520
projection of X is large and you don't

1352
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:13,679
care about dense subsets you are still

1353
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,440
forced to care about dense subsets

1354
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:17,840
because you need the dense subsets to

1355
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:20,960
prove the non-conentration assumption

1356
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:23,280
when you iterate. So how did we prove

1357
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:26,080
that a plus little aa satisfies the

1358
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:28,159
stronger non-conentration assumption?

1359
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:31,920
By proving that the projection of dense

1360
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:34,560
subsets of a * a are large. So even if

1361
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,320
your your ultimate goal doesn't involve

1362
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:39,199
looking at dense subsets, you still need

1363
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:41,920
to look at them subsets along the proof

1364
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:43,520
and you cannot avoid that. Or maybe you

1365
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:48,120
can, but at least with this method of

1366
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:48,120
proof, you cannot avoid that.

1367
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:54,480
Yes.

1368
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,800
>> Can you say a little bit more about how

1369
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,880
to handle the issue that the uniform

1370
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,520
subset at different scales might be

1371
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:04,400
different?

1372
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,400
>> Yeah. So I unfortunately I didn't

1373
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:09,440
realize this issue would arise so I

1374
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:12,960
didn't check carefully.

1375
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:16,840
>> Um but yeah it's a it's a it's a very

1376
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,840
good question. Um

1377
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,880
yeah. Okay. So I'm not exactly sure but

1378
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:30,320
let me say something that might work in

1379
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:35,520
this case but it certainly works in

1380
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:37,679
other cases. So I explained an idea

1381
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,280
superficially of first getting an a

1382
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:41,920
prime and if that a prime doesn't

1383
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:43,679
exhaust a we take it away and find

1384
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:46,000
another a prime. One can do something

1385
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:48,800
similar for uniform sets. So rather than

1386
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:51,120
taking one uniform subset, one can so

1387
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:54,800
one is given a set and one knows nothing

1388
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:57,520
about that set and we can nearly exhaust

1389
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:00,320
that set by a finite union of uniform

1390
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:02,159
subsets. So one finds a dense uniform

1391
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:05,040
set takes it away finds another uniform

1392
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:06,640
set takes it away and in this way we

1393
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:09,760
essentially cover the set with a very

1394
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:11,760
small error by uniform subsets. Uh so

1395
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,080
this is one way to get around the issue

1396
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:16,080
that one uniform substate itself is

1397
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:20,440
maybe too sparse and then at different

1398
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:20,440
scales different things could happen.

1399
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,679
So that's I think that could be one way.

1400
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:28,640
I don't think that's what we do in the

1401
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:31,679
paper but I think that's one thing you

1402
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,679
could do to bypass this issue.

1403
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:37,840
>> Yeah. You said last time that there was

1404
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:40,400
possibly a way to simplify this.

1405
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:44,239
>> Uh we we are not sure yet. Uh we are

1406
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:48,640
hopeful. Yes.

1407
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:52,960
Yeah. again um this so bugan's original

1408
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:54,880
proof uh is different in the sense that

1409
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:57,199
he didn't construct an expanding

1410
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:00,880
polomial at all

1411
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:03,920
but it is similar in the sense that

1412
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:07,360
uh he proves this and then uses the many

1413
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:09,760
back symmetric hours to

1414
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:11,760
to to get the full statement but to

1415
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:15,440
prove this he did something different

1416
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:18,239
but okay other claim is more difficult

1417
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:20,640
than what I explained but I don't know

1418
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:23,600
it's a

1419
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:27,199
yeah now now we have this idea from last

1420
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:28,640
week uh that yeah might be a so

1421
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:30,800
basically it would be a much easier way

1422
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,480
of doing this to go from this to the

1423
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,840
full statement the only way we know how

1424
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:39,040
to do it is how Bang did it by doing the

1425
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,040
many barometric
