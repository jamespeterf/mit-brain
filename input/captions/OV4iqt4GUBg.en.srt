1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:04,880
All right, so let's get started. Let me

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,080
introduce our first speaker, Professor

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,240
Donna Freriedman. She is a professor at

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,080
MIT's chemistry department. And

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,400
recently, Donna has taken on the

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,119
responsibility as a faculty director for

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,240
the new MIT quantum initiative about

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,439
which she's now give us an overview.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,800
Over to you, Donna.

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,560
>> Thank you um for that kind introduction.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,800
and I'm really excited about the

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,239
opportunity to share some of the

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:39,200
directions that MIT is um pursuing in

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,840
the quantum space. So recently we

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,680
started cumit the MIT quantum

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,640
initiative. We had our official launch

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,039
event on Monday. I'll tell you a little

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,320
bit about the framing of this and how

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,280
we're thinking about developing our core

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,920
tools in quantum and connecting to our

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,320
broader community. And then I'll leave

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,000
um a bit of time for questions because

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,320
this is a new initiative and this is

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,560
something that I think we're pursuing in

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,159
a way that's a little bit different than

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,360
the other quantum initiatives that

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,360
you've heard of. So to start, and I

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,840
think that this is probably an audience

29
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,920
with some level of expertise in the

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,960
quantum space, but I'm going to take a

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,400
minute to frame out how we're conceiving

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,240
of the quantum space for cumit. And so

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,119
one way that we can think about the

34
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,520
quantum space is that quantum is

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,240
fundamentally a collection of tools. We

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,200
have quantum computers, quantum sensing,

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,320
quantum networks, quantum metrology,

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,159
etc. those tools in their development

39
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,799
have been um if anything superlative at

40
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,079
MIT and I'll talk a little bit about the

41
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,560
history and MIT's role and the present

42
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,600
and future and what we're doing during

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,880
this um brief webinar but what I want to

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,000
highlight here is that there are two

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,840
components to building up quantum one is

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
continuing with the tool development

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,959
building the best quantum computers in

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
the world I think that Will will talk

49
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,239
about that a bit next. Um, he has a

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,400
great uh he has some great progress on

51
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,239
building the best quantum computers in

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,640
the world and I think that you'll hear

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,080
other speakers talk about alternate

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,959
methods as well. Um, quantum sensing is

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,760
something where we take the fragility of

56
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,040
quantum states and the potential to

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,959
interact them and entangle them and use

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,040
those delicate states to measure the

59
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,000
world around us. This is something where

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,239
MIT also has tremendous excellence in

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,959
terms of building the tools. Um for

62
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,280
example, my colleague Pa Capillo wrote

63
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,480
the defining review in this field

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,920
framing the problem and she's done

65
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,040
elegant work um taking quantum sensors

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,959
into new regimes. Uh we have quantum

67
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,840
networks. I'll talk a little bit about

68
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,680
the network between MIT and Lincoln Labs

69
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,760
and quantum metrology is arguably older

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,200
than this second quantum revolution and

71
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,280
something that has been uh largely

72
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,720
reinterpreted as part of it which I

73
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,599
think is quite lovely. So I talked a bit

74
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,840
about the quantum tools here but I said

75
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,840
there were two components. There's the

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,480
component of building but then there's

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,000
the component of implementing. If we

78
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,959
think about tools in any form, the core

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,360
thing that we need is users and cumit is

80
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,400
very focused on building the interface

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,799
between the tool developers and the tool

82
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,519
users and thinking about this in a

83
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,799
code-design approach. So if we take for

84
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,040
example a quantum computer, what CUMA is

85
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,000
focused on is building for example the

86
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,080
connection between the hardware, the

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,959
error correction, the first layer of

88
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,200
quantum algorithms, the second layer of

89
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,120
algorithms which starts to connect to a

90
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,439
user problem and the external user. And

91
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,840
so if we think about this saying a

92
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:11,599
quantum computer for example will solve

93
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,720
a chemistry problem. If we only develop

94
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,199
from the core from quantum computers and

95
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,359
we don't also push in from the chemistry

96
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,519
side we're missing a huge part of the

97
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,560
equation and we're effectively missing

98
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,840
the value proposition. What cumit will

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,360
do is work with chemists work with

100
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,520
endusers in all spaces. Um, and I mean

101
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,479
that on the corporate end, on the

102
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,280
academic end, on the government end, um,

103
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,600
on the national security end, and think

104
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,840
about where there are problems where

105
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,000
quantum tools could create a

106
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,440
transformational impact and bring

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,680
together these lines of individual

108
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,800
users. And so by bringing uh teams

109
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,440
together, we believe that we'll we will

110
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,520
better understand the places where

111
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,759
quantum tools can change the world

112
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,400
around us. And this is a problem that in

113
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,960
a sense is perfectly suited for academia

114
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,600
because academia is an amazing place

115
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,080
where failure is a good thing. If we um

116
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,520
try 10 problems and only one of them

117
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,120
works, those other nine problems can be

118
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,360
really interesting research

119
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,800
publications. They add to our

120
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,440
understanding. And so the fact that

121
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,560
failure is in a sense success in the

122
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,080
academic frame really enables academics

123
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,160
to take on a lot of the high-risk um

124
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,759
work in this area. And this is something

125
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,160
I think is really promising for

126
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,360
partnering with companies that have

127
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,800
their challenging problems which can be

128
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,479
addressed by specific well-designed

129
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:57,039
quantum tools. Um I'll also briefly

130
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:59,120
mention uh the history of MIT. So,

131
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,800
arguably, I think you've probably heard

132
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,080
that we're living in the second quantum

133
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:08,800
revolution and that all of this work

134
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:12,319
comes out of the core idea that quantum

135
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,319
is a tool that can be used not just for

136
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,720
observation of the world around us, but

137
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,560
for control. Um, this is potentially the

138
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,240
place where the second quantum

139
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,400
revolution started. And this is a

140
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,280
conference at Endicott House. If you'd

141
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,280
like um to see the names of all the

142
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,440
participants, there's a QR code in the

143
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,759
bottom corner of the window that you can

144
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,919
use and that will give you all of the

145
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,840
names of the human participants, but

146
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,560
sadly not the dog. Um, and so this is

147
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,800
MIT. MIT started the second quantum

148
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,919
revolution. And I would be remiss if I

149
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,880
didn't mention that MIT is at the

150
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:54,080
absolute frontier of the second quantum

151
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,120
revolution 40 years later. We are

152
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,039
leading in translation. Um I think that

153
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,360
I've picked these companies very well

154
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,240
considering the other participants of

155
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,840
the webinar. One of the notable

156
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,160
successes of quantum is using quantum

157
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,440
sensors to sense gravitational waves.

158
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,160
For example, we have um a quantum

159
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,199
network between MIT and Lincoln Labs

160
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,240
which I believe is 43 km. And between

161
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,800
MIT and Lincoln, we are really pushing

162
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,120
the field forward. And so this amazing

163
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,599
collection of scientists is very well

164
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,400
poised to start to develop these

165
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,880
connections with end users.

166
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,199
I'll also note that a big project at MIT

167
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,479
that I won't talk further about is

168
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,319
developing a physical home for quantum.

169
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,840
And this is something we're looking at

170
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,759
in building 39 to have a physical code

171
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,759
space. And this is something where we're

172
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:56,319
broadly interested in partnerships. Um

173
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,639
not sure when my talk started. So I

174
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,280
am going to end by briefly talking about

175
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,319
the structure of cumit. And I think this

176
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,080
will be a good transition to Will who is

177
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,919
an integral part of cumit. So the way

178
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,199
that we've structured this is in a very

179
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,800
toolbased way. We've um because we're

180
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,520
MIT we have the world leaders in every

181
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,560
area and so each quantum pillar is a

182
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:27,759
tool. We have quantum sensing where Pala

183
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:30,080
Capillo who is one I mean world expert

184
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,560
in quantum sensing both on the tool

185
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,039
development side and on integrating with

186
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,360
end users. Her work has been so

187
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,000
thoughtful and deliberate. I don't even

188
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,320
know what to say about Will. just

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,080
absolutely one of the world leaders in

190
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,920
quantum computing and you'll hear from

191
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:52,160
him next. Um CQE um is will lead CQE

192
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,040
which is transforming into one of our

193
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,560
quantum pillars and I'm sure he'll talk

194
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,600
about um his amazing contributions

195
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,120
there. We also have Vlad and Vulletak

196
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,200
who um I think you might hear about with

197
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,880
uh Quer

198
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Cuer

199
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,920
um and

200
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,880
Pablo's work on materials for quantum is

201
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,320
unmatched and then of course we have a

202
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,800
Lincoln lab liaison because any quantum

203
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,880
program at MIT would not be complete

204
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,080
without Lincoln which is a huge

205
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:32,080
component of MIT's quantum footprint and

206
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,560
uh Jon Yoder is our liaison there and

207
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,279
she's been absolutely amazing at making

208
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,800
sure that our work is coordinated with

209
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:44,320
Lincoln. Um so with that I think I will

210
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:48,200
conclude and thank you for attending and

211
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,200
open the floor to questions.

212
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,839
Thank you very much Donna uh for this

213
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,000
wonderful overview and uh we definitely

214
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,399
want everyone to type your questions.

215
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,360
This is the right time and so I will get

216
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:07,120
started. Um

217
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,519
Dana, so could you talk about um what

218
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,160
kind of companies that you are looking

219
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,720
for as a as a let's say ideal partners?

220
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,560
Is there US company? Is it okay non US

221
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,040
company? Is there any specific sectors

222
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,360
that you're looking for? We're looking

223
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,519
for broad participation both on the tool

224
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,279
development and so there you can think

225
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,560
about partnering directly with quantum

226
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,959
computing companies. um you know for

227
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,320
example working directly with a quantum

228
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:37,920
computing company on um

229
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,680
algorithms and algorithm end users is

230
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,640
something that we've been pursuing

231
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:46,480
lately thinking about how we can create

232
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:49,839
these lines from hardware all the way to

233
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,519
users. Um that's a great example of the

234
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,680
type of partnership we could have with a

235
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,360
quantum computing company. Also, we're

236
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,560
interested in partnerships as they

237
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,200
relate to the physical space. Um, but

238
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,120
we're also interested in developing

239
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
these end users. We're very interested

240
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,320
in working with companies that have

241
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,040
challenges were um quantum computing,

242
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,600
quantum sensing, etc. can address these

243
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,040
challenges. companies um you know closer

244
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,880
to my own space as a chemist in the um

245
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,160
pharma space and the chemical design

246
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,040
space where there are key bottlenecks

247
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,040
where today's tools cannot solve these

248
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,360
bottlenecks. We'd like to work with

249
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:34,480
companies to identify the problem and

250
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:37,279
take a code approach that goes from um

251
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,440
challenge to implementation. And we

252
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,440
think that this is a truly perfect time

253
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,920
because quantum is as the title of this

254
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,680
webinar says um it's at a point of

255
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,920
acceleration. This is a transformational

256
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,640
moment in quantum.

257
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:59,680
Wonderful. So another followup question

258
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:03,120
is that uh for companies who is now

259
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,519
interested in developing talents uh

260
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,160
build up capabilities but they are not

261
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,120
ready to invest in millions or you know

262
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,160
100 people on those what advice you

263
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,160
would have for them to start up uh maybe

264
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,720
take the first few steps and working

265
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,639
with MIT how MIT can help those kind of

266
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,480
companies

267
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,880
>> um you know I don't know if Will will

268
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,120
cover this but there is um an education

269
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:33,760
program that will um has been

270
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:37,760
instrumental in um that I think expro is

271
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,600
the uh correct term um and I think that

272
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,720
that would be a great starting point

273
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,160
engaging on that education level.

274
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,040
>> Wonderful. Thank you. Uh so we have a

275
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,240
question here. Let me just uh read out

276
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,279
to you. Um, so this is from Steve Bush

277
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,680
and I am a end user. What can you say

278
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,880
about the lack of good benchmarks for

279
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,880
scientific computing applications?

280
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,760
Um, I will admit I don't fully

281
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,440
understand the question. So I think that

282
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,839
um, but I'll interpret it in the way

283
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,920
that makes sense to me. So I think that

284
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,000
it's it's really tough to have

285
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,399
benchmarks, right? because you're both

286
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,519
developing algorithms and you're

287
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:27,120
implementing them. And so I think that

288
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,360
um and so you might be referring to the

289
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,720
fact that a quantum computing algorithm

290
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,360
can be highly successful um and then a

291
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,040
classical algorithm can take it over

292
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,360
because nobody developed the right

293
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,760
classic algorithm. And so this is

294
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:46,000
something which is um part of

295
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,920
ongoing development finding the right

296
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,320
algorithm and finding the questions that

297
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,880
really can't be answered classically and

298
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,800
I think that there's a huge space there.

299
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,720
Um

300
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:01,760
I think almost I'm not sure

301
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,839
I'm not benchmarking is really important

302
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,639
but I think if you identify a problem a

303
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,279
quantum computer can solve it and it

304
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,320
wasn't solvable before maybe it doesn't

305
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:16,639
matter as much if there would be a way

306
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,040
to solve it otherwise if you put in you

307
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,480
know 10 times as much effort. I think

308
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,480
being able to figure out what the

309
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,279
problems are, finding the right path to

310
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,480
solve them expediently

311
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,600
is the core goal. Um, and my apologies,

312
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,560
benchmarking is a broad category. So, I

313
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,399
hope I got a bit of your question.

314
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,279
>> Yeah, wonderful. Thank you, Dennis. So,

315
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:43,120
the next question is about storage of

316
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:46,240
data. So today uh you know we still

317
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,079
storing data in binary format and now uh

318
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,600
for the compute side where we use

319
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:54,720
quantum cubit format. So the question is

320
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,800
why don't we use this the cubid format

321
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:03,120
in storage as well.

322
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:08,560
Um the shortest answer to that is um

323
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:10,160
coherence time. And so I I think that um

324
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,800
maybe a broader answer is more

325
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,800
appropriate which is I don't think

326
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,279
quantum computers are ever going to

327
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,839
replace classical computers. This is an

328
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,240
area w which will be developed in

329
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,399
parallel right and so quantum computers

330
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,240
will be used to solve certain problems

331
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,760
where a quantum computer is the best

332
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,000
tool.

333
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,160
Right now for data storage, classical

334
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,760
computers are the best tool. And I think

335
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,160
that for any application of a tool, you

336
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,160
use it where you need it, but you don't

337
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,440
apply it where you don't need it.

338
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,560
Perhaps AI is a good example of this uh

339
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,920
that we've seen in our everyday lives.

340
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,720
Sometimes um it's the right tool.

341
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,639
sometimes um

342
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,360
it hallucinates 20 references and is not

343
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,079
the right tool and quantum and AI in a

344
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,199
way have very little in common but the

345
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,800
same framing of use the tool that you

346
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,600
need.

347
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:14,560
>> Thank you. I think our time is up so

348
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,560
thank you very much Donna. Thank you.
