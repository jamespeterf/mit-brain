1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,759
hello everybody congratulations on

2
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,800
getting problem set one

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:23,000
in now the reward is your first

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:27,439
unlocking video so a topic Part D this

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,880
is topic one D and you get to have

6
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,920
certain tools that you can use to build

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,000
future problems and solve future

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,719
problems and build future problem sets

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,559
uh using music 21 so I'm in Jupiter you

10
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,800
probably want to be doing this well you

11
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,320
can do it in Jupiter or you can do it in

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,840
your own favorite editor by the way pie

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:52,039
charm will really save you problems on

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,120
in this class okay so we're going to uh

15
00:00:52,039 --> 00:01:00,000
introduce music 21 you can import music

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:04,400
21 but n not really we're going to do

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,720
from music 21 import pitch because

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:12,080
you've unlocked your first pitch object

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,280
and Pitch module pitch is lowercase here

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,040
so it represents a module in music 21

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,840
and uh we'll be calling things in it now

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,680
in the problem set you were probably

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,439
representing pitches as something like

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,280
this or you know and harmonically

25
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:33,079
equivalent whatever um in music 21

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,880
you'll probably want to use our pitch

27
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,200
object so the pitch object is found in

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,119
the pitch module it's the pitch module

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,840
is lowercase p and the pitch object is

30
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:46,960
capital P and we can do the same thing a

31
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,079
Shar 4 and in Jupiter we can just hit p

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,159
and get that you can also if you're on

33
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,680
the terminal print p and you can see the

34
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,960
representation is slightly different

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,640
okay so let's figure out what we know

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,920
about this pitch object so

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,240
during the problem site you were

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,759
creating functions that worked on string

39
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,280
or other list inputs but now we're going

40
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,480
to that we have an object we're going to

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,720
be calling methods and attributes

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,519
directly on it so one of the attributes

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,239
of the pitch is its name and the name

44
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:23,200
you can see is a string that's why it

45
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:27,400
has the quotes around it a sharp great

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:31,319
and um well where's its octave take a

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:34,959
guess you. octave

48
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:39,640
okay so this is nothing too surprising

49
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:42,440
here um let's grab ourselves uh a

50
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:46,879
slightly different pitch we'll say um b

51
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:52,920
equals pitch. pitch

52
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:56,920
b0 say B here is that b 0 and we can get

53
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:00,480
the pit B's name which is B also get B's

54
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,879
step which is also B so those two things

55
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,120
look like they do the exact same thing

56
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,000
but go back to our P object and figure

57
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,480
out for a second what the difference

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,480
between name and step

59
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,920
is okay did you figure out that P's name

60
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:30,480
has the sharp in it the P's step does

61
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:35,120
not so this says what diet onic step

62
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,120
what letter name is in the pitch

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,560
itself

64
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,920
and are these things mutable I actually

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,920
made a mistake in the four to five class

66
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,000
on the first day and said that these 21

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,159
objects were not mutable they actually

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,040
are and

69
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:58,120
um what uh but most of the methods that

70
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,079
are called on them try to not mutate by

71
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:05,360
default so but if you want you can

72
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:10,680
change it so now p is a gsh

73
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:14,439
4 P's octave stays app 4 um how do we

74
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,680
get that GAR 4 you could do print p.

75
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:21,959
name plus string of p.

76
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:25,720
octave you get that or there's something

77
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:29,360
called name with octave which is pretty

78
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:34,960
nice now let's create a B flat in octave

79
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:39,479
6 so we'll call it B flat equals pitch.

80
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,479
pitch take a second on what goes

81
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,199
here okay we're back and then we can get

82
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,400
be flat and octave six there notice by

83
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:54,000
the way again that we don't uh ever name

84
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,840
variables with hyphens in them because

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,199
uh it's trying to say well B minus flat

86
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,280
wait yeah that doesn't make any sense so

87
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,280
B flat is B minus

88
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,800
6 and uh sorry B yeah B flat 6 take a

89
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,000
second and try to figure out what if you

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,520
wanted a B natural in Optive -6 how

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,520
would you do

92
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:36,919
this great did you get really low B

93
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:38,639
equals pitch. pitch b i before and now

94
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,400
really

95
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:47,520
low. octave equals

96
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,560
-6 notice that the name with octave for

97
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,680
this is the same

98
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:56,199
as oops where was it as B

99
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,199
Flats name with

100
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,479
octave so probably you're going to want

101
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,319
most commonly to when you're actually

102
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,479
working with your with your objects to

103
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:13,520
do the two

104
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:17,440
parts separately so that you can see the

105
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,440
difference between that

106
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,759
and

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,520
that okay so now we have a pitch and

108
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,039
it's kind of like big whoopy dooo you

109
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,360
could have done this yourself and uh you

110
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,240
know why why do we need to do anything

111
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,479
with this well let's

112
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:43,400
create uh another pitch and we'll make

113
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:47,840
it a pitch that's pretty

114
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,680
common we call that middle C right great

115
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,360
so here's middle C and we can get its

116
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:58,000
midi number and so it knows things like

117
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:02,319
this if we say p. octave equals 5 now

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,919
it's middle of CL and we figure out what

119
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,319
its mini number is that's that's pretty

120
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,080
fantastic

121
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,919
um we can also do kind of fun

122
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,120
interesting things what's its name in

123
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:21,160
Spanish what's it name let's say

124
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,639
um see double

125
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,759
flop name in Spanish now I think that

126
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,080
that's pretty right what's his name in

127
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,759
German okay it's actually actually a

128
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,840
little bit more fun if you worked with

129
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,840
German names

130
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:44,159
like this

131
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,720
and right that's not part of the lure in

132
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:51,080
this class but kind of a fun thing to do

133
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:55,159
um we worked on the distinction between

134
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:58,440
uh midi and PS in your um in your

135
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:01,440
problem set so let's recall what does PS

136
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
stand for

137
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,000
get pitch space so the pitch space is

138
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,039
the same in this case as the midi number

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,680
they're exactly the same U some things

140
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:18,560
we can do though is well let's say we

141
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,319
set it to 70.5 does that have a name uh

142
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,360
yep that's kind of weird thing um you

143
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,800
can get its full

144
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,879
name be half flat okay so we're learning

145
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,399
certain things that we can do with this

146
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:39,719
but P's PS is 70.5 but midi must be a

147
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:39,719
round number so it's I guess be just be

148
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:48,320
natural the other thing is if we go to

149
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,600
really low B was it really low B flat no

150
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,600
really

151
00:08:51,160 --> 00:09:01,120
low it was just be natural really low B

152
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:04,600
and get its it's oct6 get its

153
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:08,240
name and get its

154
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:12,560
PS wow that's extremely low that's what

155
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,680
is that 10 109 notes below middle C but

156
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,839
its midy number is constrained to be

157
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,760
between 0 and 127 okay these are just

158
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:25,440
kind of fun things to play around with

159
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:29,839
you can um do a directory on any pitch

160
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,600
object and see some of them the are in

161
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,320
here ignore the ones with underscores

162
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:40,760
for now we can see that um Oh there's uh

163
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,760
the frequency so let's let's

164
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,160
create what's the only one that most of

165
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,720
us know the frequency of on the top of

166
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,040
our

167
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,519
head great A4 is 440 so we're well an

168
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:00,160
American made this so it's not 442 or

169
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,160
anything like that

170
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,560
so you'll see that not everything we'll

171
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,040
be um working with here there's certain

172
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,680
things of fundamentals and um and

173
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,720
harmonics and and stuff like that that

174
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:17,240
we'll get to but let's um let's see what

175
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:24,200
some of these are

176
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:28,680
um are uh methods and not um and not uh

177
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:31,320
attributes so let's do P.G lower and

178
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,320
harmonic

179
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,079
and that gives us a g double flat maybe

180
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,040
we'll make p an A flat now we can play

181
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,200
around 415 yep that's lower n harmonic

182
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,519
is G Shar

183
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:49,880
and let's the higher n harmonic of a

184
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:53,440
flat think about it in your

185
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:58,160
head right B triple

186
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:00,959
flat okay by the way P doesn't change

187
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,000
that's what I said about the um this

188
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:10,200
being mostly non-mutable so we have to

189
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,200
assign that bple flat to something else

190
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,639
triple flat

191
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:20,120
flat yeah so much um great and now we

192
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:25,040
can do the bple

193
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:29,040
flat. name and let's give it full

194
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,040
name right

195
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:34,399
okay going back to P which is this a

196
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,200
flat 4 one of the other things we can do

197
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,399
if we want to have mutable um objects

198
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,600
will go lower and harmonic to get the G

199
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,320
sharp but let's we have we can do this

200
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,160
particular attribute where we can see um

201
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,519
in place equals

202
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,600
true and now it doesn't return anything

203
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:58,240
but P has switch from a flat to TSH so

204
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,760
you can do things however you would

205
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,519
like take a minute now to explore the

206
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,920
system and here are some questions that

207
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:11,760
I'd like you to work on while you're

208
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:13,360
exploring number one what happens if you

209
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,880
create a

210
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,880
pitch without any

211
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:31,160
arguments what happens if you create a

212
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:31,160
pitch with uh number as an argument

213
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:41,639
too big

214
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:45,560
and what happens if you create a pitch

215
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,560
and leave off its

216
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:53,199
octave okay those are the pretty fast

217
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:59,560
ones now some a little bit more fun ones

218
00:12:53,199 --> 00:13:02,760
um how are accidentals stored on a pitch

219
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,760
object in music

220
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,720
21 do all notes have

221
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:15,600
accidentals take a few minutes and work

222
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,600
through that on your

223
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,600
own great are you back let's see what

224
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,600
our answers are what happens in Crea a

225
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,600
pitch without any other arguments

226
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:36,079
we get that it's a c and if we get what

227
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:40,160
that notes midi number

228
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,959
is 60 so it's a C4 okay something a

229
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,160
little bit strange what if you create a

230
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:45,160
pitch with a number as its

231
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,399
argument uh let's say

232
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:58,199
61 okay now we get a c for how does it

233
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,639
know it's our d flat does doesn't really

234
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:04,839
know that great

235
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:07,000
um now let's see what happens if um you

236
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:10,959
create a pitch and leave off its octave

237
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,959
I think we might have already seen this

238
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,199
but C sh we'll call

239
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,199
this

240
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,920
sharp and notice the difference here

241
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,800
there's no octave number shown when we

242
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:31,199
when we do this that's but when we look

243
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:34,000
at its MIDI it's still 61 well what does

244
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:38,480
this mean well it means that certain

245
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,199
things were going to end up um getting

246
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,480
uh treating octave as something that's

247
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,000
implicit so here if we just say pitch is

248
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,959
a

249
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,639
c and

250
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:59,839
60 let's get its lower and harmonic that

251
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,680
should be a B Sharp we'll call it BS

252
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,480
B

253
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,920
SHP B's AR of BS um and now let's look

254
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,199
at its midi

255
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,800
number oh it's jumped all the way up

256
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,800
because what it tries to do in this case

257
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,480
is if you give it no octave it tries to

258
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,839
create everything in the octave around

259
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,519
middle C so that's kind of neat um okay

260
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,440
next question is a little bit harder how

261
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,279
are accidentals stored on a pitch object

262
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,959
in reason 21 well let's look at B's

263
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,959
accidental

264
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:38,199
back so I didn't totally spelled that

265
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,759
right um and it has these little carrots

266
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:43,160
around it which probably means it's some

267
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,399
sort of a object thing so we'll call it

268
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:49,160
act for

269
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:53,360
accidental and see that here and we

270
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:57,279
can get the type of it oh okay it is uh

271
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,920
its own object and we can endure The

272
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:05,000
Accidental to see certain things that it

273
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:08,839
knows its alteration what is

274
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:13,360
that 1.0 that's the number of semitones

275
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:17,160
above the uh accidentalist object there

276
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,360
great um and well that's basically the

277
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,600
one I mean you can do um I think it has

278
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,720
a name

279
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:28,600
also right well that's a sharp um that

280
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:32,160
name equals flat okay we're going to be

281
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:36,880
able to change oops plat as a

282
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:42,279
string does this change hey it does now

283
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:44,480
ACC was a attribute on this bar object

284
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,440
so now let's see did we change anything

285
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,480
about

286
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:53,839
bsharp hey now it's a B flat um same

287
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:57,880
great we can see that uh we can also do

288
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,800
Unicode name and get okay great so we

289
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:04,000
get to see the nice if you ever want to

290
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:09,600
print something out you have all of

291
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:13,439
that the last question was do all sorry

292
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:17,000
oake do all pitches have

293
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:21,000
accidentals so let's try working on that

294
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,760
um acal obviously it does great but what

295
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:30,840
about C equals pitch. pitch let's make a

296
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:30,840
low C here C2 great c c do

297
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,960
accidental oh do I forgot to print

298
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,919
something well let's get the alter on it

299
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,600
oh we get an error

300
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:46,720
so certain

301
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,720
notes do not have accidental if

302
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,880
accidental set to

303
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:56,799
none but we can assign it explicitly an

304
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:00,799
accidental so we can call pitch.

305
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,799
accidental natural

306
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:08,640
and now we can see that it has an

307
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,600
accidental with an alteration of

308
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,919
zero I think this is a good enough place

309
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,360
to stop for a little bit with pitches

310
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,360
take a little break and I'll be right

311
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,360
back with you with durations
