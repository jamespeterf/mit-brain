1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,240
Good morning everybody. Welcome to the

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,960
first MPG primer of the season.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,040
I am thrilled to uh introduce Dan

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,519
Snellings. He's a posttock in the Walsh

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,920
lab at Boston Children's Hospital. He

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,160
received his PhD at Duke University

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,080
working with Douglas Marchuk studying

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,480
how somatic mutations drive the

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,199
formation and progression of vascular

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,840
mal formations. Currently he's in the

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,399
Walsh lab and he is developing methods

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,760
for tracking cell lineage using somatic

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,600
mutations and applying them to

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,920
understand the impact of somatic

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,800
mutations somatic mosaicism in neiro

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,040
neurop fibro mitosis.

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,480
Um but that's actually not what he's

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,079
talking about today at all. He's talking

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,079
about the awesome power of genetic

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,480
linkage. Um and this is something that

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,520
comes up often with uh trainee trying to

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,079
understand LD. um is extremely important

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,440
and uh they're excited to have them.

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,680
Please ask questions throughout. There's

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,080
microphones um in the center and we'll

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,960
also have time at the end for questions.

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,960
>> Thank you Dan.

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,960
>> Great.

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,320
>> All right. Thanks so much Michelle for

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,720
the introduction and for the invitation

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,119
to give this talk. It's my pleasure to

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,799
give a more basic talk today that's uh

33
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,840
not so much about my specific science

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,680
though there might be a little bit about

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,000
that at the end uh and more about the

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,159
basic concept of genetic linkage and

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,400
linkage disequilibrium and phasing and

38
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,280
how this is one of the most important

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,600
tools that we use as geneticists

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,840
u and so I figured today that I would

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,079
take more of a historical perspective on

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,680
linkage to kind of understand how we got

43
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,079
to where we are and hopefully in the

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,439
process learn a little bit about linkage

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,640
LD and phasing

46
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,000
Uh and so naturally when starting a

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,119
discussion about linkage the best place

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,320
to start is by talking about hair uh and

49
00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:00,640
specifically my hair and uh how I'm

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,840
blessed to have a full head of it uh

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,159
because looking at my family tree it's

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,160
not really clear how long that's going

53
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,200
to be the case.

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,959
And so male pattern baldness has long

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,160
been known to have a very strong

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,160
hereditary component, but the mechanism

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,040
of inheritance had not been known for a

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,120
long time. Some really early studies had

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,760
suggested that it was autoomal dominant

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,560
in males and autoomal recessive in

61
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,640
females while other studies and common

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,200
folklore had suggested it was actually

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,920
an XL trait and so came from the

64
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,599
mother's side of the family. And so in

65
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,360
2005, Axel Hillar and his colleagues set

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,720
out to actually find the location of the

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,080
gene that causes male pattern baldness.

68
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,239
Uh and so they knew that the gene or at

69
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,680
least they suspected that the gene was

70
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,000
on the X chromosome, but they didn't

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,319
know exactly where it was. And so they

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,800
performed a really classic linkage study

73
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,680
where selecting just a group of 95

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,000
families and genotyping just a few dozen

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,319
markers on the X chromosome, they were

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,480
able to narrow the location of the gene

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,200
causing male pattern baldness to a

78
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,360
window on the P arm of chromosome X. And

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,280
so here at the bottom you can see the

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
different markers that they genotyped in

81
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,200
the assay. And note that this was before

82
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,800
we had things like snip chips and next

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,599
generation sequencing. So all of this

84
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,599
was done manually by I'm sure graduate

85
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,519
students and postocs and undergraduates.

86
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,120
Uh and you can see this uh LO score

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,959
increase on an arm of the chromosome.

88
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,840
And this actually corresponds to the

89
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,159
location of the androgen receptor which

90
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,640
is responsible for binding testosterone

91
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,040
in males and seemed like a very likely

92
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,599
candidate at the time.

93
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,239
And so today with modern G-W was we have

94
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,400
much larger cohort sizes and we genotype

95
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,959
hundreds of thousands or millions of

96
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,480
variants within a single assay. And we

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,319
do find that there's a lot of other

98
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,480
factors across the genome that

99
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,040
contribute to male pattern baldness. But

100
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,400
that initial finding on the X chromosome

101
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,720
remains our strongest hit to date.

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,760
Uh and so I I bring this up as as an

103
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,400
example of how we can use linkage to

104
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,959
answer one of the most challenging

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,440
problems in genetics. That is how do we

106
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,079
actually find the variance driving a

107
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,600
phenotype whether that phenotype be

108
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,000
baldness or disease or even just what

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,960
makes us human.

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Uh and so to take a historical

111
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,440
perspective on linkage uh we need to

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,120
start by talking about Mendele uh who

113
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:46,479
worked on P's from 1956 or sorry 1856 to

114
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,919
1863 and he was really the first to

115
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,400
realize that traits such as the color of

116
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,800
peas and the shape of peas and their

117
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,759
seeds um were heritable units that

118
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,320
followed a regular pattern that could be

119
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,680
reliably predicted from the phenotypes

120
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,240
of the parents. So here crossing uh

121
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,400
yellow seeds uh that are smooth and

122
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,800
green seeds that are wrinkled they were

123
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,039
able to show or rather he was able to

124
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,120
show this very regular pattern of

125
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,600
inheritance where you would get seeds

126
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:25,120
with all mixtures of these phenotypes in

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:27,120
this very stereotyped pattern of 9331.

128
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,080
And so this observation eventually led

129
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,639
to the law of independent assortment

130
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,120
which is that two traits uh are

131
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,600
inherited independently of one another.

132
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,759
And so whether you inherit one trait is

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,560
totally independent of whether or not

134
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,759
you inherit a second trait.

135
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,720
And so the first problem with this idea

136
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,639
really came out of Mendele's the

137
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,680
rediscovery of Mendele's work in the

138
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:57,919
early 1900s when a group uh with Bateson

139
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,240
Saunders and Punet were trying to

140
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,120
reproduce some of Mendle's findings. And

141
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,840
so they were studying uh flowers that

142
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:11,440
had purple flowers and long pollen and

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:15,520
red flowers with round pollen. And so by

144
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,720
crossing the F1s of that cross uh they

145
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:22,080
expected to see that same 9331

146
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,400
ratio that Mendele had described. Uh but

147
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,080
in fact what they observed was a stark

148
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,360
difference from that 9331 ratio. And you

149
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,360
can see here that uh there are very few

150
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,400
flowers that they obtained that have

151
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,759
purple flowers and round pollen or red

152
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,759
flowers and long pollen.

153
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,520
And at the time they didn't really have

154
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,039
a great explanation for why that was. uh

155
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,120
and it wasn't really until a decade

156
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,360
later when uh Hunt Morgan who at the

157
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,080
time had been working on similarly

158
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,840
linked traits in the sex chromosomes of

159
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,280
Drosophila

160
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,919
uh and his student who had the insight

161
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,960
that by looking at variance in the

162
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,080
strength of linkage between two traits

163
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,199
you could actually arrange the gene

164
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,520
causing those traits on a linear entity

165
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,720
which we now know as a chromosome.

166
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:22,639
And who traits that were more strongly

167
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,720
linked were more close together on that

168
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,199
linear entity and traits that were less

169
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,039
linked were further apart. And this was

170
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,759
really the first genetic map uh that

171
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,360
really launched the field of family

172
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,280
based linkage studies and human

173
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,720
genetics. Um and so Sturdivans also uh

174
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,639
noted that in cases where you break this

175
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,639
linkage, so in the previous example

176
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,720
where we have purple flowers with round

177
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,360
pollen, these are cases where we've had

178
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,120
a crossing over event on a chromosome

179
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,199
that actually occurred in between the

180
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,039
site of the genes causing those two

181
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,680
traits.

182
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,479
And so this was really beautifully

183
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,520
demonstrated later in the 30s by Barbara

184
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,240
Mcccleintoch before her Nobel work on

185
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,759
transposons uh and her colleague Harriet

186
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,599
Kiteon who at the time had been

187
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:17,919
developing cytogenetic tools in maze. Uh

188
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:20,319
and so they were studying traits in corn

189
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,319
maze that were similarly linked. And so

190
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:28,720
here looking at uh colored and colorless

191
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:33,360
kernels and smooth and wrinkled seeds uh

192
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,120
by performing a cross between uh hybrid

193
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,959
that is hetererozygous for both of these

194
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,440
traits and uh the parent that is

195
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,120
homozygous for the recessive alle. You

196
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,880
would expect to find an even

197
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,399
distribution of phenotypes for all of

198
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,800
these sets. And in fact uh similar to

199
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,560
what uh Bates and Saunders and Punit

200
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,120
found, they see a deviation from that

201
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,160
expectation and that there's very few

202
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,800
offspring that have a re combination

203
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:06,640
event between those two sites. Uh and

204
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,560
this is really reflecting that those two

205
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,959
the genes driving those two traits are

206
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,040
very close uh on chromosome 9 in maze.

207
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,519
Uh and so

208
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,920
Mcccleintoch and Katon were studying

209
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,440
various different pairs of phenotypes

210
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:27,440
within maze and one had a particularly

211
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,519
striking uh characteristic that enabled

212
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,560
them to really see linkage with their

213
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,839
own eyes. Uh and that's this pair of

214
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,680
stud kernel color and waxy endosperm.

215
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,120
And so the the characteristic that

216
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,880
really enabled this is that when they

217
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,720
looked at the chromosomes driving these

218
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,399
traits, they found that using these

219
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,279
cytogenetic tools, they could actually

220
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,040
visually distinguish one chromosome from

221
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,680
the other. And that was because the

222
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,200
chromosome harboring uh the colored alil

223
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,120
and the waxy alil had a visible knob at

224
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,600
the end. This being heterocchromatin, a

225
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,839
very dense area of heterocchromatin. And

226
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,160
it also had an extra piece at the end.

227
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,360
And so they had these markers on either

228
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,120
end of the chromosome that they could

229
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,440
use a microscope to actually visually

230
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,399
observe. And so when they did this

231
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,120
cross, what they found similarly to what

232
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,680
they had here, they had some uh number

233
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,399
of offspring that had a recombination

234
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,959
between those events uh less than would

235
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,399
be expected by independent assortment.

236
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,959
And when they looked at the chromosomes

237
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,519
of those offspring, they could see that

238
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:33,200
all of those recompinants actually had

239
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,760
the knob at one end and uh missing the

240
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,760
extra piece at the other or the extra

241
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,079
piece at one end missing the knob at the

242
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,240
other. So actually visually saw the

243
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,000
recombination event happen or could at

244
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,320
least infer that it must have happened.

245
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,079
And so this series of observations with

246
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Sturdivvent and genetic maps and the

247
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:56,959
idea that uh genes are on this physical

248
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,279
linear entity and linkage is the

249
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,920
phenomenon resulting from crossing over

250
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,040
during meiosis uh really led to the

251
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,959
field of family based linkage analysis

252
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,880
that has been probably the most powerful

253
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,399
tool for understanding the cause of

254
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,120
mandelian disease. Um,

255
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,160
and so here in this example, we're

256
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,600
looking at uh one chrom one pair of

257
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,519
chromosomes from uh an initial coupling

258
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,519
of an affected male and an unaffected

259
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,000
female. And throughout the generations,

260
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,720
we can see that children are affected as

261
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,040
well. And what we can do in family based

262
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,959
linkage is just genotype a handful of

263
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,440
markers across the chromosome. And these

264
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,959
markers are broken up over generation by

265
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,000
recombination events. And so what we see

266
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,880
if we after doing all of this analysis

267
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,959
and looking at all of the identified

268
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,200
markers in the affected and unaffected

269
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,320
individuals, we can see that there's a

270
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,800
region of the chromosome that harbors

271
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,079
this C alle in all of the affected

272
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,360
progeny and does not harbor that C alle

273
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:08,000
in all of the unaffected progeny. And so

274
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,040
this celio may not be the actual cause

275
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,959
of the disease but is something nearby

276
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,680
such that we are observing linkage

277
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,880
between the actual genic cause of

278
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,440
disease and this C alil that we were

279
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,000
able to genotype.

280
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,920
And so this had been hugely successful

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,160
for studying mandelian diseases and

282
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,240
really high-profile successes like

283
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,480
mapping the gene for cystic fibrosis and

284
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,279
Huntington's. Over the years, there have

285
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,480
been thousands more mandelian traits

286
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,760
that have been mapped to causal genes

287
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,639
using family- based linkage analysis.

288
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,320
Uh, however, it really was not so

289
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,720
successful for studying complex disease.

290
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,000
And so here in pink you can see the

291
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,079
meteoric success of linkage for studying

292
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,600
mandelian traits throughout the 80s and

293
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:02,560
90s but relatively little progress for

294
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,399
understanding complex disease which was

295
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,240
I think particularly disappointing at

296
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,920
the time because there was a lot more

297
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,639
effort being put into understanding

298
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,800
these very common complex diseases than

299
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,639
there was effort understanding these

300
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,320
rare but very numerous mandelian

301
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,160
diseases.

302
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:25,040
And so the reason this is is just a a

303
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:27,519
mathematical consequence of uh the way

304
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,800
uh effect sizes and penetrance works

305
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,720
where in mandelian disease you can be

306
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,959
quite confident at least for very high

307
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,800
penetrance variance that if you have the

308
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:41,200
genotype you will have the phenotype and

309
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,040
if you do not have the genotype there is

310
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,680
no instance in which you have the

311
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,320
phenotype. So very high penetrance, very

312
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,240
high effect sizes. Uh and this is not

313
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,279
true for complex diseases. I think we

314
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,519
all know there are usually many genetic

315
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,760
factors that contribute to complex

316
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,720
disease. And there's also many non-

317
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,600
genetic factors that also contribute to

318
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:08,480
genetic disease.

319
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,959
And so what are we to do? Uh so in in

320
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,120
the light of all of this uh work trying

321
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,639
to use linkage with few exceptions

322
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:20,560
unsuccessfully in complex disease uh

323
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:23,440
Neil Rich and Kathleen Marie Marongas

324
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,480
uh were trying to to get a mathematical

325
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,360
handle on this difference and they

326
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:34,480
modeled uh how many families you might

327
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:38,160
need to observe an effect in a variant

328
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,199
that wasn't uh such a high effect size.

329
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,120
And so here looking at a very popular

330
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,839
design for linkage studies at the time

331
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,000
where you look at affected siblings and

332
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,800
find areas of the the genome that are

333
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,600
shared between those siblings. Uh if we

334
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,160
look at effect sizes of you know 1.5 to

335
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,040
four times more likely to have the

336
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,959
disease. Uh it turns out that you know

337
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,480
as demonstrated by the lack of success

338
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,880
in linkage you really need an

339
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,240
astronomical number of families to

340
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,920
detect variance at small effect sizes

341
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,839
using linkage based analysis.

342
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,839
But what was really heartening is that

343
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,560
they proposed this alternative study

344
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,120
design where instead of trying to map

345
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,800
the gene using linkage, you instead test

346
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,760
for direct association between some

347
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,560
puditively causal variant and whether or

348
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:34,480
not that person inherited the disease.

349
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,360
Um and these numbers were uh as you can

350
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:42,800
see much more favorable uh even for very

351
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:46,480
low effect sizes and for uh very uh rare

352
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,240
population al frequencies.

353
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,079
And one other benefit of this is that

354
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,480
you didn't need to capture these massive

355
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,240
families but rather you could focus just

356
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,839
on affected individuals and their

357
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,360
parents for doing these kinds of

358
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,360
association studies. And so it was much

359
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,600
more accessible than collecting very

360
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,720
large pedigrees.

361
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,880
Um however the main limitation of

362
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,680
association is that you need to actually

363
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,040
know where to look. And so if you're

364
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,279
coming into a complex disease and you

365
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,440
don't have any prior of where that

366
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,759
causal gene may be and even what

367
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,320
variants specifically are driving the

368
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,079
phenotype, it's really hard to carry out

369
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,759
an association study, especially in

370
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,880
these days when, you know, a we don't

371
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,560
even really fully understand the degree

372
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,320
of variation that's present within

373
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,959
different human populations and we

374
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,519
really don't have the tools to genotype

375
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:38,320
variance across the genome at any

376
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,959
reasonable level of throughput.

377
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,519
Uh and so at this time we kind of

378
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,759
understood that association seemed to be

379
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,839
the way forward for understanding

380
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,720
complex disease. But what do we actually

381
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,279
need to make those kinds of studies a

382
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,440
reality? And so one thing that had been

383
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,680
sorely missing was as I said just an

384
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,839
understanding of genetic variation

385
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,160
within the human genome. And so this was

386
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,199
really helped along by several large

387
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,280
projects to sequence uh or at least

388
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,839
genotype individuals from many different

389
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,799
populations and get an idea of how much

390
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,760
variation is there in the human genome.

391
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,520
Uh and this ultimately culminated in uh

392
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,720
many of the databases that we use all

393
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,400
the time today like db snip and nomad

394
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,720
and you know many others that have

395
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,880
cropped up over the years.

396
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:31,919
And so one of the the key insights from

397
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,640
these basic studies of genetic variation

398
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,799
in humans has been a that there's a lot

399
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,840
of variation in humans. Uh each

400
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,320
individual on average has about 4

401
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,880
million variants and as expected from

402
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,799
the out of Africa hypothesis African

403
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,320
populations typically have far more at

404
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,160
about 5 million variants. Uh but what

405
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,559
was really important to recognize is

406
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,640
that the vast majority of these variants

407
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,200
are actually shared between populations.

408
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,840
They're very old. And so in this graph,

409
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,480
the colored bars are noting variants

410
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,720
that are uh unique to that population or

411
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,520
to that individual. Whereas the the two

412
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,120
gray bars are variants that are shared

413
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,280
throughout the entire world or just

414
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,440
within that continent. And what you'll

415
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,960
notice is that the vast majority in most

416
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,840
populations, the vast majority of

417
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,880
variants are shared across continents or

418
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,240
even across the world. And this makes

419
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,160
the problem a little bit more tractable

420
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,480
where everyone has 4 million variants,

421
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,720
but in total there's only about 10

422
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:36,000
million common variants in humans.

423
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,960
Uh, and the other key observation that

424
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,280
kind of follows from this is that most

425
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,440
variants are really old. And this is the

426
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,880
core concept of linkage disequilibrium

427
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,480
where generally in most cases a variant

428
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,360
that we observe in an individual

429
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,440
happened one time in some ancestor and

430
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,600
is now present in many people as a

431
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,520
consequences of heredity rather than

432
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,120
that mutation occurring many different

433
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:05,600
times. And so because the mutations are

434
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,360
old and occurred once, these uh variants

435
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,360
are only separated from their

436
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,240
surrounding sequence by recombination

437
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,160
events happening across generations. And

438
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,320
so here we can see in present- day

439
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,679
chromosomes, if you look in the area

440
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,400
around some marker of interest, they

441
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,880
actually all share sequence identity

442
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,039
with that ancestral chromosome. And this

443
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,080
is again just another manifestation of

444
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:33,520
the property of linkage where uh the

445
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,600
closer you are to a marker and the more

446
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,440
recent that mutation is, the more likely

447
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,240
you are to have the same sequence

448
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,960
surrounding it.

449
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,840
And so uh one of the important

450
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,880
properties of LB is that it erodess over

451
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,760
generation. So LD is a function of

452
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:55,760
mitoic or sorry myiotic recombination

453
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,960
events separating out those alals and uh

454
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,679
kind of making that hletype smaller over

455
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,080
time. Uh and so over a few generations

456
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,360
you can see there's some combinations uh

457
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,640
that make these blocks of color smaller

458
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,880
as you go. uh but then over hundreds and

459
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,520
thousands of generations these blocks

460
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,160
erode away into very small chunks of

461
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,679
DNA. Uh but note that this is a very

462
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,280
long process and for most of the

463
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,640
variants we look at today we can see a

464
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,760
reasonable level of linkage to

465
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,280
equilibrium that we can leverage in many

466
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,520
of our genetic studies.

467
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,559
And so

468
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:37,360
another key observation from these basic

469
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:40,480
studies of genetic variation in humans

470
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,919
is this observation that recombination

471
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:47,120
is not random across the genome. There

472
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,400
are hot spots of recombination and as a

473
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,760
consequence of that we get this

474
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,760
phenomenon of hletype blocks where there

475
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:58,320
are sets of snips or varants along the

476
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,159
genome that are almost never broken up

477
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,600
by recombination.

478
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,799
And so these are uh a really critical

479
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,760
observation that led to eventually the

480
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,440
HAPMAP project and mapping out um

481
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,600
applotype blocks in humans and

482
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,320
leveraging that information to very

483
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,200
intelligently design uh genotyping

484
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,960
arrays and actually perform association

485
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,960
studies. Um but the other critical need

486
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,360
for actually doing an association was

487
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,840
really a technological innovation of

488
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,240
being able to genotype many variants in

489
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,919
parallel. And this really came around

490
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,760
circa 2005 when the first uh high

491
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,400
throughput genotyping arrays came out

492
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,000
from aluminina and aphometrics uh where

493
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,760
we're able to assay hundreds of

494
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,640
thousands of variants at the same time

495
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,440
in a single essay.

496
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,159
And so the question that arises from

497
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,880
this is okay, we've got 10 million

498
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,200
common variants within the human genome

499
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,960
and room for at the time maybe a hundred

500
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,640
thousand or a few hundred thousand

501
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,039
variants to fit on these genotyping

502
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,360
arrays. So, you know, if we're going to

503
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,360
do association studies and expand this

504
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,679
out to many hundreds and thousands of

505
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,559
individuals per study, we need to have a

506
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,600
really efficient way of assaying all of

507
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:18,000
the genetic variation in humans without

508
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,200
uh breaking the bank. And so, how do we

509
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,360
actually go about choosing SNIPS to

510
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,320
effectively design arrays for genotyping

511
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,919
uh association studies?

512
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:36,799
And the critical observation that makes

513
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:39,360
this possible is that we can use LD to

514
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,480
infer genotypes that we didn't actually

515
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,200
directly assay in our arrays. And so

516
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,000
that is if we have you know a haploype

517
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,559
block and a few variants in LD and we

518
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,600
look within the population and we see a

519
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,600
a G accotyping

520
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,600
array that only assays these first two

521
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,240
variants. we can actually infer and in

522
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,080
fact computationally fill in the third

523
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,840
variant without ever needing to assay it

524
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,559
directly because we know that this

525
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,880
variant is in tight LD with the other

526
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,760
two and therefore we don't actually need

527
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,720
to assay it directly and so through this

528
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:24,320
principle the hatmap project set out to

529
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:28,880
actually map uh common hletypes within

530
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:31,039
humans and figure out how we can

531
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,080
effectively genotype a small number of

532
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:37,919
variants and get the maximal genotyping

533
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:41,280
information from that via this idea.

534
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,440
And so this is some information from the

535
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,720
hatmap project looking at effectively a

536
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,440
European population. And this idea of

537
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,679
using a snip uh that you actually assay

538
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,120
to then infer other genotypes. That

539
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,360
assayed snip is the tag snip. And when

540
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,799
we look at power versus the number of

541
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,640
markers we assay, we can see that by

542
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,120
using the hapmap project and actually

543
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,720
mapping out all of the hlo types, common

544
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:12,880
hlet types in humans, we can effectively

545
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,679
design tag snips that uh outperform

546
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,600
arrays made by random snips by a factor

547
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,840
of maybe two or fivefold. Um, and one

548
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,840
thing that is really clear here is that

549
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,039
in a hypothetical world where we didn't

550
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,960
have LD, we would need to assay, you

551
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,799
know, an order of magnitude more

552
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,799
variance in order to get the same level

553
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:39,039
of power um that we would using snips

554
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:41,279
designed with LD in mind. Um, and so at

555
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,679
the end of the day, what they find is

556
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,840
that in order to get a pretty reasonable

557
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,880
power for doing association studies, we

558
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:52,240
can get by just assaying around 30,000

559
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,760
uh 300,000 snips.

560
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,720
And so this led to an explosion of G-W

561
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,960
was studies and understanding in complex

562
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,440
disease that I think ultimately is the

563
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,520
best for another primer at another day

564
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,679
specifically dedicated to GIWAS. But um

565
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,919
just making note that this has been a

566
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:17,679
very successful strategy for identifying

567
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:20,679
genic factors that drive um complex

568
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,679
disease.

569
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,840
And so

570
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:30,640
beyond just imputing snips uh using tag

571
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:33,279
snips, one other really important

572
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,520
property that we get from LB is the

573
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,919
ability to actually imputee haploype

574
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,840
structure which is very important for

575
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,279
many assays that uh we perform. And uh

576
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,360
this is basically the idea that we have

577
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,120
a list of variants across a chromosome.

578
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,000
But how are they actually arranged on

579
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,440
the maternal and paternal copies of the

580
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,279
chromosome? And so by taking data from

581
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,520
hapmap and thousand human genomes and

582
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,080
other sources uh we can take a

583
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,039
population reference of how hloypes are

584
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,559
arranged and use that information to

585
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:09,279
computationally infer how variants are

586
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,200
aligned across a chromosome. And so this

587
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,799
is again just leveraging the idea that

588
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,720
if we have two variants that are close

589
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,039
together and observed to be in very high

590
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,760
LD, we can infer that they're present on

591
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,760
the same hletype.

592
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,840
Um and so these days there are many

593
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,240
excellent tools for doing uh hletype

594
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,120
estimation and phasing and here are some

595
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:36,000
of the ones that I have used. Um but one

596
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,039
thing to keep in mind when imputing

597
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,200
phase from population data sets is that

598
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:46,240
it is prone to error. And so this is an

599
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,760
example where we have uh the true phase

600
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,080
laid out in orange and blue. And when

601
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,240
deriving phase from population data

602
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,880
sets, often what you get is these phase

603
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,120
switch errors where in the individual

604
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,320
there has been recombination event

605
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,080
relative to the population references

606
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,960
that you're looking at. And so you end

607
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,039
up having this switch in phase along the

608
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,400
chromosome. And this can happen multiple

609
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:16,000
times uh going down the chromosome. And

610
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,720
so there's a few ways to uh ameliate

611
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,240
these errors. And one of them is uh are

612
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,440
simply just using a bigger reference

613
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,960
data set. And as time goes on and we

614
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,960
sequence more and more individuals, this

615
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,520
gets easier and easier as we've got

616
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,080
massive uh data sets of individuals that

617
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,720
we can use for doing really effective

618
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,799
phase imputation from population data

619
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,480
sets. And this is nice because it's uh

620
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,080
easy to do. You don't need to actually

621
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,200
do any experiments. you can just

622
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,559
computationally get a really accurate um

623
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,880
phase estimation from any set of

624
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:53,120
genotyping whether that be whole genome

625
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,640
sequencing or uh genotyping arrays.

626
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,679
The other way is actually doing an

627
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,159
experiment and using readbacked phasing

628
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,000
to define hllet types. So the most

629
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,440
useful tools for this have really been

630
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,600
long read sequencing and third

631
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,640
generation sequencing where you can get

632
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,840
reads that span kilobases or megabases

633
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,399
and actually physically observe the uh

634
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,880
the phase uh within across multiple

635
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,399
variants over the genome.

636
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,240
And the third maybe the the gold

637
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:24,480
standard is to get a trio and get DNA

638
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,799
from mom and DNA from dad and from that

639
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,000
in most cases you can unambiguously

640
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:33,120
derive the the hlet types present within

641
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,840
the child.

642
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,200
Uh and so now in the second half of the

643
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,120
study I thought that I would talk a

644
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,880
little bit about my own work and how

645
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,640
I've used phasing to understand uh

646
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,600
vascular malf formations during my

647
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,200
graduate work. And so uh when I was a

648
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,360
graduate student at Duke, I was studying

649
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,159
this rare mandelian disease, hereditary

650
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,399
hemorrhagic toangictasia. And this is a

651
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,919
disease of autoomal dominance caused by

652
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,200
a mutation in three different genes

653
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:03,760
involved in the same pathway. Um and it

654
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,679
causes vascular mal formations. The most

655
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,600
prominent of them being mucosal to

656
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,840
lantictasia. So these are like small red

657
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,520
spots as you can see on mucosal

658
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,799
membranes. So uh tongue, lips, eyeballs,

659
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,840
fingers. Um but then more uh

660
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:22,000
perniciously they also cause arterior

661
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,399
venus malfforms in internal organs. So

662
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,240
the most prominent being lungs and brain

663
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:30,799
and you can see this mass of vascule in

664
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,000
the lung and in the brain that

665
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,559
ultimately uh what's going on is in a

666
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,720
normal artery vein connection you have

667
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:40,720
uh the major artery and veins separated

668
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,799
by a capillary bed that in a very

669
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,520
careful and controlled way allows blood

670
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:50,000
to flow and nutrients to reach uh

671
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,799
tissues in that area. However, in HHT,

672
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,960
what happens is you get enlargement of

673
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,520
those capillaries and effectively direct

674
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,720
shunting between arterial and venus

675
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,200
blood which reduces the efficiency of

676
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,600
things like respiration. And so you end

677
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,600
up uh most often getting high output

678
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,440
heart failure.

679
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,120
And so

680
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,240
when studying HHT, one uh observation

681
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,360
that really drove our thinking was this

682
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,679
uh disjointed nature of the genotype in

683
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,200
the phenotype where this is an autotoal

684
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,600
dominant disease. So they have a

685
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,480
hetererozygous causal mutation in one of

686
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,279
these genes and the genotype that causal

687
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,840
mutation is present in every cell in the

688
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,080
body. But the phenotype these vascular

689
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,480
mal forations are inherently focal

690
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,240
phenomenon. we get spots, we get

691
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,480
discrete AVMs. Um, and so we really

692
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,159
wanted to understand what was underlying

693
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,559
that difference. Why weren't we getting

694
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,840
this kind of systemic vascular

695
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:53,760
malfformation that you might expect from

696
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,600
uh having the mutation present in every

697
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,440
cell?

698
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,559
And so one thing that we thought uh

699
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,679
could be the cause is a sematic mutation

700
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,679
similar to what you get in cancers. uh

701
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,080
this is a mutation that arises

702
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,520
postsygotically in cells during

703
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:14,000
development and in fact as we age and uh

704
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:17,039
these mutations are not present in every

705
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,600
cell of the body and uh can be present

706
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:23,679
very focally within multiple tissues or

707
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,440
even within uh a single tissue and so

708
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,440
the thinking being that these vascular

709
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,720
malfformations are the result of a

710
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,279
sematic mutation in a genetic dsonian

711
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,720
two-head mechanism. So this is uh that

712
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,039
we inherit one null copy of the alil

713
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,320
from the parents and then a sematic

714
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,960
mutation leads to loss of function in

715
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,760
the same gene on the other functional

716
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,039
copy. Uh

717
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,440
and that this event following by uh

718
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,399
likely many other non-genetic factors is

719
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,279
what's actually driving tillasia and

720
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,840
vascular malfformation.

721
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,320
And so when setting out on this study to

722
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,360
see if sematic mutations were actually

723
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,840
the driver of vascular malf formations

724
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,480
in HHT, there were three things that we

725
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,360
were expecting to find if this two hit

726
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,600
mechanism was indeed true. And so the

727
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,279
first of those is that the mutations we

728
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,840
identify would be in the same gene. So

729
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:25,519
we've got a germline inherited mutation

730
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,080
and a postsygotic sematic mutation. And

731
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,880
these are the three genes that uh are

732
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,799
known to cause HHG. And the expectation

733
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,360
would be that the sematic mutation and

734
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,080
the germline mutation occur in that same

735
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,000
gene. The second would be that these

736
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,080
mutations are all causing loss of

737
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,600
function. So think frame shift splice uh

738
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,919
mutations.

739
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,080
And then the third and importantly I

740
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,080
think for demonstrating the benefits of

741
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,320
uh phasing is that the mutations are

742
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,039
biic. And so if we have a loss of

743
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,279
function mutation uh on one alil and

744
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,519
then later sematically we get another

745
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,440
loss of function mutation but in that

746
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,240
same alil we still have one functional

747
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,120
copy of the gene and wouldn't expect uh

748
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,360
vascular mal formations to form. Uh and

749
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,360
so following from this hypothesis we're

750
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,840
expecting that the variance would be in

751
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,440
trans affecting both alals such that no

752
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:23,600
functional protein remains.

753
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,640
And so in doing this uh we set out with

754
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,039
20 samples of tangictasia from

755
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,880
individuals with HHT and use target

756
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:33,279
capture to sequence really just a

757
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,360
handful of genes that we suspected to be

758
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,440
involved in vascular mal formations from

759
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,760
other studies at the time in other

760
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,240
diseases and then sequenced them to to

761
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,559
very high depth to identify sematic

762
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,480
mutation and then following that do some

763
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,080
validation with just amplon sequencing

764
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,960
and make sure that the variants we're

765
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,919
identifying aren't artifactual.

766
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,640
And indeed what we found is that in nine

767
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,200
of those 20 sematic mutations here

768
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:03,279
showing the germline mutation, we also

769
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,840
found a loss of function or most likely

770
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:10,560
to be loss of function mutation in the

771
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:12,480
same gene in each case. And uh of these

772
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,919
most of them were very obviously loss of

773
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,480
function mutations. Five of them were

774
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:19,599
frame shift. Three of them were inframe

775
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:23,200
indels affecting multiple uh amino acids

776
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:26,480
and the third was a splice site mutation

777
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,000
affecting uh four bases after the exxon

778
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,079
intron junction which is a little far

779
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,399
out. So we did I don't show the data

780
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,240
here but we did experimentally validate

781
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:37,440
that using splicing assays and showed

782
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,879
that uh it did disrupt uh splicing and

783
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,119
there were no uh fulllength transcripts

784
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,800
of the gene remaining.

785
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,359
uh but one thing you'll note that is

786
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,320
particularly challenging for studies uh

787
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:54,000
in this nature is that unlike in cancer

788
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,240
where you basically get a clonal mass of

789
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,320
cells that have expanded in vascular

790
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,240
malf formations it's not so clonal and

791
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,480
these sematic mutations are present at

792
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,160
very low al frequencies which makes

793
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,160
identifying them a little bit more

794
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,440
challenging

795
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,520
and so really for that third point of

796
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,160
testing whether or not those mutations

797
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,040
were in by a leic.

798
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,440
We looked across uh we looked for

799
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,200
readback phasing in this case not using

800
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,880
uh statistical phasing because these are

801
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,040
rare mutations not present within

802
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,720
population data sets. And so in order to

803
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,280
get any information about phase we need

804
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,800
to actually observe phase. Um and so

805
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,720
here's an example where we have the

806
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,520
causal germline mutation on the right

807
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,520
hand side and a sematic mutation a one

808
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,240
base pair deletion causing a frame shift

809
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,640
on the left hand side. And when we look

810
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,359
at all of the reads with the sematic

811
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,480
mutation, you can observe that we have

812
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:52,320
the wild type or the reference al uh at

813
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,320
the site of the germline mutation

814
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,800
indicating that these variants are in

815
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,480
fact in trans and u

816
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,720
presumably in the cells with the

817
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,000
mutation have no functional protein

818
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,680
remaining. And we got lucky in this case

819
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,680
where the germline and sematic mutation

820
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,160
just happened to be very close together

821
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,119
and could be phased directly from the

822
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,160
reads used for discovery. In most cases

823
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,520
that wasn't uh true and we turned to

824
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,839
long read sequencing to figure out uh

825
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,960
how those variants were arranged. So

826
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,800
here an example uh on the bottom where

827
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,800
we can see the discovery reads that

828
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,960
these are very far apart and basically

829
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,800
have no chance of directly phasing them

830
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,800
from aluminina reads. But then with pack

831
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,040
bio we can very clearly see that all of

832
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,680
the reads with the sematic mutation have

833
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,920
the reference alil at the site of the

834
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,800
germline mutation. And we were able to

835
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,720
do this for seven of the nine uh variant

836
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,480
pairs we identified. And in each case

837
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,720
they proved to be bileic.

838
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,359
And so the question then is what about

839
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,000
the other 11 mal for uh that we didn't

840
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:03,119
find a mutation in? Is there some other

841
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,960
mechanism by which uh these mal

842
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,760
formations can form or is there

843
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,040
something that we're missing? And our

844
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,200
expectation is really that there's

845
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,480
something that we're missing. For

846
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,240
discovering the variance, we use

847
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,280
targeted short read sequencing of just

848
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,760
16 genes, which is really great for

849
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,240
picking up small events like single

850
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:25,520
nucleotide variance and small indelss,

851
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,640
but much less useful for picking up very

852
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,760
large varants that are just as likely to

853
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,800
cause loss of function.

854
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,200
Uh, and so to get at this question, we

855
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,040
looked at traditional methods for

856
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,000
identifying structural variation within

857
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,480
the human genome. And uh one of the most

858
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,320
common is using microarrays. So

859
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,520
genotyping arrays similarly to what's

860
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,520
used for G-W was to look at snips across

861
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,240
the chromosome. And here looking at

862
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,320
chromosome 21 in a normal individual.

863
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,240
Here we're plotting the alternate alil

864
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,079
frequency. And you can see we've got a

865
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,160
bunch of hetererozygous variants. We've

866
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,079
got a bunch of homozygous variants the

867
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,839
ref or alt. uh and then we have the LRR

868
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,320
which you can interpret as the

869
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,040
genotyping intensity on the microarray.

870
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,800
So an LRR of one is what we would expect

871
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,920
to find for a normal diploloyid

872
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,240
individual. LR above one indicates the

873
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,640
presence of a gain and LR below one

874
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,839
would indicate the presence of a loss.

875
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,000
And here in an example of tricomeme21 a

876
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:31,200
patient with down syndrome you can see

877
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,680
that the bal frequency bifurcates where

878
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,760
you have one alil that rises in

879
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,320
frequency the one that is duplicated and

880
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,960
the other uh is decreased in its

881
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,200
relative frequency and similarly with

882
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,800
the LR you can see that to be elevated

883
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,359
above one indicating the presence of

884
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,880
chromosomal gain

885
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:53,280
and so uh it turns out that picking up

886
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,680
variance with microarray via traditional

887
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,000
methods is very challenging when your

888
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,000
alle frequency is extremely low. This is

889
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,480
a germline event. So it's present in

890
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,200
every cell in the body. But if we look

891
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,079
at a sematic event that uh is only

892
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:11,920
present in a handful of cells, we use

893
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:15,680
these same metrics and really don't see

894
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:18,160
uh any obvious signs of any kind of

895
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,960
structural variation across this example

896
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:24,160
of chromosome 12. But some very clever

897
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,119
people at the broad uh have developed

898
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,359
algorithms where we can actually use uh

899
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,359
phasing information and here using

900
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:36,800
statistical phasing to uh improve the

901
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:39,440
sensitivity for picking up mosaic copy

902
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,920
number and structural variation. And so

903
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,359
here if we include phasing information

904
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:49,040
and just plot one of the parental hlet

905
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:52,160
types what you can see hopefully is that

906
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,880
we get a deviation away from neutral

907
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,520
alil frequency and occasionally we get

908
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,280
the sign shift where over here

909
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,680
everything is low then it switches to

910
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,400
high then low again then high again and

911
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,480
this is actually uh demonstrating those

912
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,119
phase switch errors that I had mentioned

913
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,400
earlier which are often the consequences

914
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,800
U statistical phasing. Uh and so here we

915
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,720
can really clearly see that deviation

916
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,839
away from neutral al frequency

917
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,119
indicating that most likely here there's

918
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,359
likely copy neutral or slight increase

919
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,920
in the LR. So maybe a copy gain on

920
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:30,800
chromosome 12 that's resulting in that

921
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:34,400
shift away from neutral.

922
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,160
And so we applied this to many of the

923
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,960
toangictasia that were still available

924
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,119
from that initial study where we did not

925
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,320
identify a point mutation. And in fact

926
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,720
we find that many of them do indeed have

927
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,760
some kind of structural variant

928
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,000
overlapping the causal gene. uh

929
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,079
indicating that most likely though

930
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
there's no point mutation there could be

931
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,079
copy neutral loss of hetererozygosity

932
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,040
where the germline inherited but alil is

933
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,440
copied over onto the wild type al again

934
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,280
resulting in full loss of function in

935
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,240
that protein

936
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,640
and so in conclusion what we find is

937
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,240
that these vascular malfforms in HHT and

938
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,240
many other diseases that we've studied

939
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,160
to this point are indeed caused by

940
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,880
biolic loss of function mutations

941
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,560
whether those the point mutations or

942
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,480
structural variations that are a little

943
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:29,520
harder to detect. So I think I'm a

944
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,000
little bit ahead of time, but I am

945
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,800
finished. So if there's any questions, I

946
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,800
would be happy to take

947
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,440
>> Great. Can you uh use the mic right?

948
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,240
Thank you so much.

949
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,880
>> Oh, so official. Uh, hi, I'm Dev. I'm

950
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,599
new here. Great presentation. Um, and

951
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,960
your work is is remarkable. I mean, HHD

952
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,280
is a very debilitating disease

953
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,960
clinically. I've seen it. It's it's it's

954
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,520
really bad. U, my question is, in the

955
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,520
nine individuals that were shown to have

956
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,680
the two hit, or rather the seven that

957
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,359
were confirmed to be trans, was there a

958
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,920
difference in expressivity compared to

959
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,079
those who weren't, assuming, would they

960
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,720
have maybe had a worse disease

961
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,200
progression?

962
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:21,040
>> Right. Right. Yeah. So um

963
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,359
ultimately the sample size is really too

964
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,400
low to tell and see any realistic

965
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,880
differences in severity. Um the

966
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,880
expectation is that you know you might

967
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,200
think that okay these are the uh the

968
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,319
malf formations that have a variant and

969
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,800
so um maybe would have a worst case but

970
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:41,359
what we expect is that there are even

971
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,760
more types of variants that we haven't

972
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,359
assayed and could be present in those

973
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,280
samples that we didn't find a mutation.

974
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,800
So you could very easily conceive of

975
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,200
things like promoter methylation and

976
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,760
epigenetics having a factor having a

977
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,359
role in inactivating the functional copy

978
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,200
of the gene and and we basically have no

979
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,119
sensitivity for those. So to answer your

980
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,640
question, no, we don't see differences

981
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,319
in expressivity. We really don't have a

982
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,560
power to do that. But also the

983
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,680
expectation is that the mutations are

984
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,839
there even if we don't see them.

985
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,839
>> Thank you.

986
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:19,280
>> Um hi. Um, I was wondering if anyone has

987
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:22,319
ever modeled sematicism,

988
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,200
is that possible to model just like 20%

989
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:29,359
loss of a mutation in a cell and show

990
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,359
like a functional outcome or difference?

991
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:34,000
>> Yes. So, uh there's been a lot of

992
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,440
efforts to model mosaicism. And the one

993
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,079
that I'll mention in relation to this

994
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,560
work is there's uh some really beautiful

995
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,119
work uh developing they're called

996
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,760
tangictas on a chip where you can take

997
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,000
endothelial cells and put them on a

998
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,920
micrfluidic chip introducing kind of

999
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,440
flow as normal endothelial cells would

1000
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:57,440
expect and introduce cells with the

1001
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:00,800
sematic mutation at a any ratio that you

1002
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,359
would like and kind of model how that

1003
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,560
you know artificial vessel develops And

1004
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:08,880
they do see that you get mal foration of

1005
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:13,800
the vessel even with very small

1006
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,800
inclusions of mutant endothelial cells.

1007
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,400
>> Have time for a couple more.

1008
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,760
>> All right. I'm going to give you a fun

1009
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,920
one. I feel like when I ever go back and

1010
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,359
revisit the the basics, I learn

1011
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,240
something new. And you did a deep dive

1012
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,680
into some linkage history. I guess I'm

1013
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,520
wondering if you learned anything new

1014
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,000
when you dove back into that or if there

1015
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,800
are any fun facts or historic fun facts

1016
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,880
that you didn't share.

1017
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,839
>> Yeah, I mean I uh I had a really great

1018
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,680
time putting together this presentation

1019
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,880
reading a lot. You know, I I had learned

1020
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,040
about a lot of the concepts in human

1021
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,640
genetics classes, but I didn't really

1022
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:56,640
have an appreciation of the history of

1023
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,640
how it came to be. So uh I had a great

1024
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,800
time reading through old papers and old

1025
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,560
perspectives on the history of genetics

1026
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,160
and learned a lot of cool things like

1027
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,480
what I had mentioned in the talk where I

1028
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,720
didn't know about knobs on maze

1029
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:13,200
chromosomes and how uh that had been

1030
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:16,560
used to actually observe linkage and uh

1031
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:19,440
many other things that uh are kind of

1032
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:21,599
just interesting bits of history more so

1033
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,760
than uh

1034
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,800
really fundamental genetics knowledge.

1035
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,720
that remains uh important today. I mean,

1036
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,720
I'm I trying to think back and think if

1037
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,040
there's any like nuggets of wisdom. Um

1038
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,839
but nothing's immediately coming to me.

1039
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,280
>> Um

1040
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:41,280
>> oh, go ahead. or something. So on the

1041
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,520
1984

1042
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,119
on the 1984

1043
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,520
cytogenetics

1044
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:52,240
um exam for for clinical cytogenetics,

1045
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:56,880
there was a question on the first page

1046
00:45:52,240 --> 00:46:02,960
that asked about what um uh uh twin

1047
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:04,640
spots were. And I worked for a a a

1048
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:09,599
department that did a lot of twin

1049
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:11,359
studies. It wasn't that necessarily, but

1050
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,359
I'm just going to ask you, what do you

1051
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,839
think the answer is? And and I know what

1052
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:19,359
the answer is now. So, um,

1053
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:21,760
>> yeah, put me on the spot. Um, I actually

1054
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:24,880
have no idea what twin spots are. I

1055
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,040
>> I was devastated. I mean, I I was a

1056
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,040
posttock at that point and that was the

1057
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,000
first time I could take the exam and I

1058
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,839
had no idea of what this thing was and

1059
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,640
it was like the fir on the first page of

1060
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:39,520
the exam. Barbara Mcccleintoch actually

1061
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,760
looking at recombination in maze.

1062
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,920
>> I don't think it ever appeared again on

1063
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,920
the exam.

1064
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,520
>> Wow,

1065
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,000
>> that's a good one. If anyone does nerdy

1066
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,400
trivia, remember that.

1067
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,520
>> Um, I was actually struck by a table

1068
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,920
that you showed from the 1996 paper from

1069
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,520
Neil Rich and Kathleen Mary Congus. Do

1070
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,200
you mind going back to that because I

1071
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,920
was looking at the ends of the

1072
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,000
associations and so if I'm reading that

1073
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:10,160
right is that like the required minimal

1074
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:14,960
N of people right so they're saying for

1075
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:19,280
a variant of a risk ratio of 1.5

1076
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:22,000
that's somewhat common or 0.02% 02% in

1077
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:26,880
the population, you'd need 20,000 people

1078
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,680
to see a association. Is that right?

1079
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,440
Because I feel like it's a lot more.

1080
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,680
>> So I think that some of this comes down

1081
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,000
to the way that they modeled association

1082
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:40,000
studies in the paper and they had been

1083
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,240
using if I think back uh a particular uh

1084
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,920
model of an association study that had

1085
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,920
been previously proposed on the basis of

1086
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,520
linkage to equilibrium.

1087
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,680
uh and my knowledge of that paper is not

1088
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,480
really deep enough to be able to say how

1089
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:57,440
reasonable that is the reality. So it

1090
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,280
doesn't surprise me that it is off from

1091
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,359
uh off from what we actually observe

1092
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,880
doing them today. It is just interesting

1093
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,880
to think about it from that point of

1094
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,680
view and think, oh, they thought we only

1095
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,160
needed 20,000 people to identify, you

1096
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,359
know, SNIPS for common variants. But,

1097
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,800
um, you know, yeah,

1098
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:14,800
>> but at the end of the day, I think the

1099
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,839
point holds true that, uh, you would

1100
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,440
need many families to do the same

1101
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:21,440
discovery from a linkage based.

1102
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,240
>> Okay. So, it was really about comparing

1103
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,079
the 5 million to the 20,000 and saying

1104
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,200
G-W was the better way to go. That was

1105
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,119
the take.

1106
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:31,200
>> Uhhuh.

1107
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:33,359
Um, I think we'll do this one quick one

1108
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,359
online. Do you know if people are still

1109
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:38,000
doing classical linkage analyses for

1110
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:40,000
monogenic diseases? And if so, are G-W

1111
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,720
was snip genotyping arrays most useful

1112
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,800
or superior to exo data?

1113
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,720
>> Oh, yeah. No, I I linkage studies are

1114
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:49,599
definitely still being done and I think

1115
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:52,640
they're still very effective for uh high

1116
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:54,800
penetrance monogenic diseases. uh I mean

1117
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,440
the fact of the matter is that for rare

1118
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,520
disease you're very unlikely to find any

1119
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,480
affected individuals within a population

1120
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:05,359
and so you know even if you do it's

1121
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,480
probably uh not likely that those

1122
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:10,400
individuals are related by uh you know

1123
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,240
that that variant arose in those

1124
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,079
individuals via a relationship but

1125
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,960
rather that those variants occurred

1126
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:20,559
independently and so you can't really

1127
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,800
use G-W was for doing uh the same kind

1128
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,680
of monogenic linkage analysis that you

1129
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,599
would use for doing rare disease today.

1130
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,960
Uh so yes, it's definitely still

1131
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:33,119
relevant and being used. Great. I think

1132
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,720
that is time. Let's thank Dan. Thank

1133
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,720
you. See you next week.
