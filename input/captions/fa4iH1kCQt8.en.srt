1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,960
Thank you. Um we're harvest AI we do

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,879
crop prediction and beyond. Uh we do

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,960
that on the basis of computer vision and

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,800
machine learning. Uh currently for

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,040
commercial indoor farming operations

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,920
that is uh both uh traditional green

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,320
houses and vertical farms.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,240
Why are we doing this? Um, indoor

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:26,240
farming um has been uh growing

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:30,320
exponentially um uh in part uh to a

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,599
number of um uh macro effects including

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,440
the impact of climate change on

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,680
traditional agriculture, urbanization

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,320
and fears uh by a number of countries

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,440
about disruptions in supply chains uh

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,920
especially since COVID and hence um uh

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,239
problems with food security.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,800
Uh the sector has experienced a number

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,920
of uh of problems despite this demand.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,440
Rising opex uh market pressures

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,680
especially supermarkets squeezing

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,399
margins um and a lot of untapped

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,359
potential of the of the data that modern

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,479
green houses spit out uh but that are

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:09,040
currently unused through any form of AI.

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:12,799
Um we are um going into that by

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,320
providing what uh indoor farmers uh

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,159
demand the most according to our

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,640
customer discovery that we did with MIT

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,119
3 years ago. Namely, we're providing

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,600
them with an insight into when they can

32
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,080
expect to harvest how much, which is for

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,080
them crucial uh for a number of

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,400
operational reasons, including, you

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,320
know, what sort of um for for their

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,759
labor planning, for example, but also

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,159
for example to align harvests with sales

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,640
uh so that um what they've harvested

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,040
doesn't rot between uh the point of

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,880
harvest and the point of sale. As

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,560
mentioned, we're doing that on the basis

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,560
of machine learning and computer vision.

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,000
This is illustrating these two strands

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,240
if you will. Uh modern green houses um

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,560
already provide a lot of these data

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,159
automatically uh that we that we need

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,240
for our for our machine learning

48
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,240
component. These are data around CO2

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,079
content uh about temperature about

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,800
humidity and so forth. Uh we uh we

51
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,879
provide in addition to that um uh

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,720
further accuracy through uh through

53
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,520
computer vision where we're essentially

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,239
tracking changes in the size, color or

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,680
shape of tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,599
and other fruit and vegetables that we

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,640
cover and provide extremely accurate

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,400
forecasts on that basis.

59
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,239
This is an illustration of how computer

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,239
vision works in our case. um uh here for

61
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,879
the case of tomatoes and changes that as

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,120
you can see uh in the in the colors and

63
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,519
and and sizes of tomatoes being used for

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,280
highly accurate prediction.

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,800
This has led to unrivaled forecasting

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,879
accuracy the leading uh uh forecast uh

67
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,120
technology in the industry. we can

68
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,120
forecast when you will will be able to

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,920
harvest how much uh with 96% accuracy um

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,680
and have done so with a number of of the

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,319
major players in the in the indoor

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:05,519
farming industry uh worldwide so far

73
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,400
for our ask um we're first showing here

74
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,360
that we've uh built our MVP and entered

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,519
the market in Europe um we've then uh

76
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,360
recently conducted a product expansion

77
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,840
where we've successfully applied our

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,080
forecasts But then gone beyond that and

79
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,440
now enable for example indoor farmers to

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,599
not only understand when they will be

81
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,599
able to harvest how much but we also

82
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,360
enable them to influence that. So if you

83
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,280
see a forecast that you don't like

84
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,400
because it's the day after Christmas or

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,080
it's on Thanksgiving day we tell you uh

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,400
how much you need to change your inputs

87
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,799
in order to have exactly the time and

88
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,159
amount of harvest that you'd like. And

89
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,760
on that that basis we're now

90
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,280
internationalizing. We've gone into a

91
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,519
number of European countries and even

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,519
recently arrived in the US um at

93
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,760
Greentown Labs.

94
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,760
Um we are for our indoor farming

95
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,840
operations particular uh seeking

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,200
partners uh that are interested in

97
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,439
helping us scale internationally and uh

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,280
secondly those that feel that that they

99
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,519
have a technology that we can integrate

100
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,879
with. So to give you an example, we're

101
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,480
currently integrating with a number of

102
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,040
players in the indoor farming technology

103
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,640
industry including uh those who provide

104
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,799
AIless and predictionless softwares for

105
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,120
for farming or indoor farming. We're

106
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,959
also integrating with harvest robots uh

107
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,320
and a number of other technologies um

108
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,800
that are already available in the

109
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,800
market. We've also recently conducted a

110
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,560
study with PWC on where else our

111
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,240
technology could be applied. And it

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,720
turns out that for example, seed

113
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,400
producers are highly interested in our

114
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,240
ability to accurately uh show what

115
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,000
ripeness stage a certain type of fruit

116
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,600
or vegetable is currently at. And

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,840
supermarkets are interested in

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,000
understanding how far what they

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,000
currently have on the shelves is from

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,120
rotting and therefore needs to be

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,960
reduced 50% in price today. If you have

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,520
similar ideas and would would like to

123
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,440
engage uh with us on uh any of these

124
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,520
applications of our technology to your

125
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,479
industry, we'd be extremely interested

126
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,479
uh to talk.
