1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Well, welcome everyone back after the

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,480
lunch break uh for the session number

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,800
three um towards clinical application.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,200
My name is Magdalina Religara. I'm a

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,440
physician scientist and a postto in Ana

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,000
Grea's lab. So this session is very near

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,920
and dear to my heart. Um so let me

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,160
introduce you the first speaker. Um his

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,760
name is Dr. Holtz Sakai and he's a

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,600
post-docctoral fellow in chemistry and

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,920
chemical biology at Harvard Medical

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,400
School in the laboratory of Dr. David

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,640
Louu. He completed his PhD at Princeton

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,320
and the McMillan lab and in the LU lab

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,680
he works on prime editing approaches

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,079
which he's going to tell us all about

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,320
today in his talk in vivoprime editing

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,640
rescues alternating hemoplegia of

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,520
childhood in mice.

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,280
Okay. Can I stand

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,559
here? Okay. Uh thank you for the

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,920
introduction. Uh today I'm excited uh to

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,760
share with you some unpublished work on

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,239
prime editing to rescue a rare

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,120
neurological condition uh called

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,199
alternating hemoplegia of childhood. And

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,880
so this is a rare disease and I hope

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,520
that some of the metal lessons that

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,360
we're able to extract from this work uh

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,240
could be applicable to your rare

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,000
monogenic disease of interest.

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,640
And so alternating hemoplegia of

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,680
childhood is a debilitating neurological

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,000
conditions where patients suffer from a

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,479
number of symptoms including paralysis

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,799
typically on one side of their body.

37
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,280
They also have a number of other

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,680
symptoms including involuntary distonic

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,640
contractions and generally can suffer

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,560
from poor coordination as well.

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,960
symptoms appear within the first few

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,520
months after birth uh and can lead to

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,320
developmental delays and patients are

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,320
ultimately in many cases unable to live

45
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:54,079
independently. So mutations in the ATP

46
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:58,799
1A3 gene cause HC and specifically in

47
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:01,759
the alpha 3 subunit of the catalytic uh

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,399
uh trimer. Mutations occur throughout

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,360
the protein coding sequence of uh ATP

50
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,239
1A3 but primarily cluster within the uh

51
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,720
central transmembrane region. Mutations

52
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,800
are hetererozygous, denovo and usually

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,720
autotosomal

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,720
dominant. And quite interestingly the

55
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,720
vast majority of AHC cases in fact

56
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,040
twothirds of them can be accounted for

57
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,400
by just these three mutations alone.

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,720
Aspartate 801, glycine 947 and glutamate

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,280
815.

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,879
So for patients with AHC uh there are

61
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,040
currently no disease modifying

62
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,280
treatments available. Uh they typically

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,599
rely on symptomatic care. They are

64
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,840
highly dependent on caregivers given

65
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,519
that at any moment they can suffer uh

66
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,599
one of these debilitating attacks and uh

67
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,120
in some cases in the most severe cases

68
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,360
patients can regress and um really is a

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,440
quite serious

70
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,080
disease. So to address the underlying

71
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,560
therapy, uh researchers at Duke uh

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,200
developed a mouse model of the disease

73
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,480
that recapitulates some of the the key

74
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,200
hallmarks of this disease. And when they

75
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,319
deliver into this mouse model uh the

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,840
humanized uh ATP-p13 trans gene under

77
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,480
control of a uh neuron specific promoter

78
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,080
while they do observe some benefit uh

79
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,319
according to certain metrics they

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,360
ultimately aren't able to find any uh

81
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,159
durable rescue out to 70 days of these

82
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,400
clinically relevant phenotypes.

83
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,000
One reason why transgene complementation

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,879
might have been unsuccessful in this

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,959
case is that actually in vitro studies

86
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,080
in xenopus oites have shown that

87
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,360
relative to wild type healthy alals uh

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,159
inclusion of dominant uh negative human

89
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,959
alles exert this uh dominant negative

90
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,840
effect uh on uh current in this

91
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,920
particular patchclamp

92
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,519
experiment. And so given the sort of

93
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,120
challenges associated with trans gene

94
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,120
complementation uh given this putitudive

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,120
uh mechanism, we asked the question of

96
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,000
whether precision genome editing might

97
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,560
be able to directly address uh the root

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
cause of AHC by reverting some of these

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,959
mutations uh and potentially overcome uh

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,120
these uh cellular mechanisms providing a

101
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,280
proof of concept uh permanent

102
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,919
intervention for this uh debilitating

103
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,000
neurological condition.

104
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,560
And so among precision genome editing

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,880
technologies of course uh crisper cast 9

106
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,400
nucleuses uh are an immensely powerful

107
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,800
approach for precisely introducing uh

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,680
gene disruption as we heard this morning

109
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,080
uh in the case of cast jevy. The LU

110
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,639
group has also pioneered uh sort of more

111
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,800
precise technologies uh such as base

112
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,840
editors which by fusion of a diaminise

113
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,040
allow us to very precisely install uh

114
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,880
transition mutations uh in the genome uh

115
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,120
as well as prime editors which by fusion

116
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,840
of reverse transcriptase allow for

117
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,000
what's effectively search and replace uh

118
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,240
genome editing and through a prime

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,560
editing guide RNA which specifies both

120
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,199
the target locus uh as well as in a

121
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,840
threep prime extension the replacement

122
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,280
nucleotide

123
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,240
sequence. And so we identified B and

124
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,199
prime editing as a potential strategy to

125
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,360
directly correct pathogenic alals

126
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:23,320
without requiring uh doublestranded

127
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,479
breaks that might uh lead to undesirable

128
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,880
outcomes. And so uh from the outset we

129
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,240
recognize that particularly uh for prime

130
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,520
editing there would be a number of

131
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,320
challenges that we would need to

132
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,280
address. The first is that uh while

133
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,759
Xvivo prime editing uh is underway in

134
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,360
the clinic uh invivo prime editing

135
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,800
particularly in the central nervous

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,199
system uh does remain

137
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,680
challenging. Second, ATP3 actually has a

138
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,440
critical role in prenatal uh cortical

139
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,280
development and so it was unclear from

140
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,240
the outset whether we could actually

141
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,080
intervene postnatally.

142
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,479
Third, in order to address a majority of

143
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,080
HC genotypes, we would need to develop

144
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,680
scalable and parallel approaches to

145
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,919
target multiple alals in parallel. Uh,

146
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,240
and finally, and perhaps most notably,

147
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,880
there had been prior to this work no

148
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,440
previous reports of prime editing uh

149
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,680
rescuing a behavioral phenotype in a

150
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,759
neurological uh disorder in an animal.

151
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
And so a really gratifying and exciting

152
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,560
component of this work um for me as a

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,560
lab scientist was getting to interact uh

154
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,919
with you know some of these patients and

155
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,400
community leaders who are on the front

156
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,000
lines. And so I really uh am gratified

157
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,319
to work with them. And you know you

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,479
can't ask for more uh motivated people

159
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,319
to work

160
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,400
with. And so uh to answer this question

161
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,479
we teamed up with a number of scientists

162
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,120
across a series of institutions. I have

163
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,600
to highlight Alex Souza uh my co-lead at

164
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,319
the Broad as well as Marcus Terry at the

165
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,360
Jackson Labs and here are fantastic uh

166
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,000
patient collaborators uh Natalia, Nina

167
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,199
and

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,479
Simon. And so we set out to target uh in

169
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:08,800
this work a majority of AHC mutations

170
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,479
collectively targeting 65% of of AHC

171
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,639
cases.

172
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,280
uh to correct these mutations. First uh

173
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,599
in human cells, we thought that in

174
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,880
principle we could apply base editing to

175
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,240
correct uh three or four of these

176
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,960
mutations. Uh but actually as it turns

177
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,120
out uh proximal bystander nucleotides

178
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,919
that would undergo uh competitive

179
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,440
damination actually prevented base

180
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,080
editing from being applied in these

181
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,639
cases. But we were able to achieve uh

182
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,759
for a well isolated adinine efficient

183
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,680
reversion to the wild type sequence. For

184
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,319
the remaining mutations we turned to

185
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,120
prime editing and from the outset we

186
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,520
included uh benign silent mutations

187
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,479
shown in green. Uh that was because

188
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,520
previous work had shown only reverting

189
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,759
the pathogenic mutation would result in

190
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,759
uh heteroduplex intermediates that would

191
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,039
be efficient substrates for cellular

192
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,280
mismatch repair. And so by incorporating

193
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,000
uh benign and co-installing silent

194
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,680
mutations uh we might be able to bias

195
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,680
repair pathways toward productive

196
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,080
editing. I'm showing just a brief uh

197
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,800
subset of the optimization experiments

198
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,639
that we performed to correct these

199
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,879
mutations. But suffice it to say that

200
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,840
after a substantial amount of work, uh

201
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,160
we were able to uh efficiently correct

202
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,680
five of these mutations uh across a

203
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,000
number of different strategies in our

204
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,279
cellular models uh of these

205
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,839
mutations. To actually translate these

206
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,320
conditions into a more disease relevant

207
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,800
uh cell type, we collaborated uh with

208
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,959
Christine and Al at Northwestern

209
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,880
uh to who had access to uh patient

210
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,959
IPS-C's.

211
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,519
when we initially tried to translate our

212
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,560
optimized uh correction for example for

213
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,160
this particular mutation uh we only saw

214
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:02,160
7% correction in IPS-C's and so this is

215
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,480
starting from uh a a genetic baseline of

216
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,240
50% these patients are hetererozygous

217
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,640
and so we're trying to make this bar go

218
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,360
bar go to

219
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,440
100 however by incorporating sort of now

220
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,240
uh routine enhancements to the prime

221
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,519
editor system including more active

222
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,200
prime editor variants uh engineered PEG

223
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,440
RNAs that enhance cellular stability as

224
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,480
well as including an additional guide

225
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,519
RNA that through uh proximal binding

226
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,360
here uh puditively uh increases the

227
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,720
chromatin accessibility of the target

228
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:41,519
site. We're able to restore uh editing

229
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,040
up to 70% in patient cells.

230
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,800
Applying these strategies across the

231
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,839
remaining mutations again we can

232
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,040
efficiently now in patientder derived

233
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,880
iPS-C's efficiently correct these

234
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,519
mutations back to wild type. Uh we also

235
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,399
assess the precision of our uh editing

236
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,120
strategy applying a genomewide

237
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,160
nomination pipeline called circle seek

238
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,720
uh to assess and nominate uh 450 sites

239
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,120
genomewide. uh actually looking at the

240
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,360
editing there we observe no offtarget

241
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,360
editing of anticipated biological

242
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,680
significance. So in this in vitro

243
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,600
portion of the work, I hope I've been

244
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,120
able to show you how by using precision

245
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,959
genome editing, uh we can uh make these

246
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,079
cell lines, something I did not discuss

247
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,760
today, uh actually optimize and refine

248
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,320
correction strategies for these

249
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,120
mutations first in in our hex cell

250
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,200
models before finally advancing them uh

251
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,399
into more advanced cell

252
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,800
types. Moving forward, we're really

253
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:46,079
excited about further scaling this uh

254
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,640
technology uh through machine learning

255
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,040
models which allow us to nominate uh PEG

256
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,600
RNAs for consideration and actually

257
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,399
evaluating them experimentally using

258
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,760
high throughput lentiviral

259
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,839
screens. And we hope that these

260
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,680
approaches or other more recent alil

261
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:06,040
agnostic technologies might allow us to

262
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,399
address a broader range of these

263
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,120
mutations. All right. So with uh

264
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,920
correction of these mutations in human

265
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,240
cells in hand, we next ask the question

266
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,360
of whether we might be able to intervene

267
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,920
uh in disease

268
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,640
biology. And so uh in the absence of

269
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,399
humanized animal models uh we considered

270
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,959
the the orthologus mouse gene. And while

271
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,120
this is over 99% identical at the

272
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,240
protein level, uh the coding sequence

273
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,480
actually differs by about 10%. And so we

274
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,079
actually reoptimized prime editing uh

275
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,480
strategies to correct these mouse

276
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,720
mutations with the enhancements uh

277
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,519
discussed previously. And we can achieve

278
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,160
correction in uh hetererozygous mouse

279
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,920
primary fiber blasts uh derived from the

280
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,920
animal models with those

281
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,399
mutations. And so this is the sort of

282
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,320
gory details of our optimized prime

283
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,360
editing system. But suffice it to say

284
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,720
that we can then package those into a

285
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,760
dual AV9 vector system wherein the prime

286
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,800
editor is split across two vector halves

287
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,040
N and C terminal that will uh upon

288
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,920
successful co- uh corransduction

289
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:22,079
reconstitute uh by protein trans

290
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,160
splicing and so along with a GFP marker

291
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,680
uh for

292
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:29,040
biodistribution uh we deliver these into

293
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:34,000
these animal models uh by intra cerebro

294
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:37,200
ventricular administration at P 0 and uh

295
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,440
subject these animals to a barrage of uh

296
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,760
phenotyping phenotypic assays including

297
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,320
at the molecular behavioral uh and

298
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,839
biometric levels. These experiments were

299
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,240
done in collaboration with scientists at

300
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,240
the Jackson Labs uh specifically Marcus

301
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Terry, Laura Anderson and Kat Lutz at

302
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,720
the rare disease translational center.

303
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,320
And so when we first assess editing at

304
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,240
the genomic level, here is the

305
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,760
hetererozygous uh baseline of untreated

306
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,720
animals. And upon prime editing, we can

307
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,320
achieve uh up to 50% pathogenic alil

308
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,639
correction in bulk uh cortex samples. Uh

309
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,560
but actually looking at GFP positive

310
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,000
nuclei. So these are cells that are very

311
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,519
highly uh transduced. uh we can observe

312
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,240
you know up to 90% or higher pathogenic

313
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,680
alil correction in certain brain regions

314
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,600
suggesting that uh in some in some cases

315
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,160
uh were more limited by vector

316
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,040
transduction than by the prime editing

317
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,839
system

318
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:41,200
itself. Uh we also assessed uh in

319
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,320
addition to uh genomic correction uh

320
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,200
transcriptional uh rescue of ATP 1A3 in

321
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,399
bulk. And uh this enrichment that we

322
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,120
observe relative to DNA is consistent uh

323
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:56,240
and consistent with the fact that AV9 is

324
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,399
expected to uh selectively target these

325
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,560
neurons where ATP-1 A3 is being

326
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,560
expressed as opposed to for example GAL

327
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,279
cells.

328
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,800
Uh in addition to uh DNA and RNA, we

329
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,519
collaborated with Kathy Swedner and

330
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,560
Elena at Mass General Bighgam to assess

331
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,360
the functional rescue of uh ATPAS

332
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,760
activity in our treated animals. And

333
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,560
relative to HC mice which display an

334
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,360
enzyatic defect, we can significantly

335
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,240
restore uh enzyatic activity back toward

336
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,440
wild type

337
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,600
levels. In addition to molecular

338
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,880
readouts, we also assessed a number of

339
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,120
critical behavioral uh phenotypes uh

340
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,680
most notably this hypothermia induction

341
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,199
assay. So here mice are exposed to a

342
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,199
cold water bath uh to induce uh episodes

343
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,720
of donia, hemoplegia, and other

344
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,079
seizure-like events that's typically

345
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,920
observed in patients. And so uh mice are

346
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,720
assigned a qualitative score ranging

347
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,720
from normal behavior all the way to uh

348
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,760
severe uh cases where the mouse is

349
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,320
unable to write itself. We also quantify

350
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,839
the number of seizure-like events and

351
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,480
measure the amount of time it takes for

352
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,839
these mice to first uh regain writing

353
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,600
and then subsequent uh normal voluntary

354
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,680
movement. And again, patients also

355
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,079
experience uh these types of symptoms

356
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,320
and so in response to harsh stimuli and

357
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:20,560
and those types of uh

358
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,360
triggers. So uh relative to HC mice

359
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,000
which score very highly on the scale, we

360
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,199
can significantly reduce uh the

361
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,440
qualitative severity of these episodes.

362
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,279
But more excitingly and quantitatively,

363
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,120
we can measure the most severe events,

364
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,839
specifically these tonic clonic-l like

365
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,839
seizures. And relative to HC mice, we

366
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,600
can essentially restore the number of

367
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,440
those events back down to

368
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,000
baseline. Uh measuring the amount of

369
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,199
recovery time for writing and also

370
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,399
subsequent uh mobility, we see that uh

371
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,839
these AHC mice have a sort of uh shifted

372
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,399
recovery time where they take much

373
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,040
longer uh to recover from these

374
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,279
hypothermic events and prime editor

375
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,519
treatment shifts that back toward wild

376
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,320
type.

377
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,360
Beyond uh these types of induced

378
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:11,680
phenotypes, we also measured

379
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,560
coordination using the roto rod assay

380
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,759
and we can restore uh coordination in

381
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,600
prime editor treated animals uh up to or

382
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,920
almost back to wild type

383
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,800
levels. Most notably, HC mice like some

384
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,639
patients can display a survival deficit

385
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,120
due to spontaneous uh episodes and HC

386
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,920
mice uh do not survive out to the study

387
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,160
end point of 52 weeks. By contrast,

388
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,480
prime editor treated animals uh we can

389
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,399
significantly enhance survival and

390
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,920
reduced instances of spontaneous

391
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:48,399
death. So I hope I've been able to show

392
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,360
you uh across the central dogma and also

393
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,680
at the level uh of uh behavioral and

394
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,279
survival readouts we've been able to uh

395
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,800
intervene in HC disease biology. A sort

396
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,680
of key missing link that we're excited

397
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,720
about exploring further is uh using

398
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,360
invivo electrphysiology to actually uh

399
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,439
assess uh to what extent prime editing

400
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,240
might be able to intervene and partially

401
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,640
rescue uh this type of circuit or higher

402
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,880
level uh complexity and this is in

403
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,600
collaboration with R Georgie and Elsa at

404
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,679
Leiden

405
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,240
University and uh sort of going to the

406
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,559
ladders to cur's idea of identifying

407
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,480
notable biological mechanisms

408
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,000
I think in the case of therapeutic

409
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,080
genome editing, maybe the biological

410
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,799
hypothesis is is often quite simple. But

411
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,440
I think now that we have these tools, uh

412
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:42,240
we can actually use them to study uh

413
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,480
biological questions related to disease

414
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,960
and its progression. For example, uh you

415
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,840
know, at what level does uh correction

416
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,039
at the protein level uh translate into

417
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,240
organ or behavioral level

418
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:55,840
phenotypes? As we advance toward the

419
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,840
clinic, we're also thinking about a

420
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,240
number of other studies related uh to

421
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,480
dosing uh more relevant routes of

422
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,280
administration uh in the clinic as well

423
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,280
as later ages of

424
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:10,080
intervention. And so that's all uh I'll

425
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,240
share today. Um but I hope uh you know

426
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,160
moving forward that we'll be able to

427
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,400
accelerate progress uh through the

428
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,880
approaches mentioned previously and that

429
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,039
this work will inspire the creation uh

430
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,039
of humanized models or alo agnostic

431
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,960
methods that will allow us to target an

432
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:28,080
even broader range of these mutations

433
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,480
moving forward. And so with that uh I

434
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,400
have to thank uh David of course uh I

435
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,880
mentioned co-leads Alex Souza and Marcus

436
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,160
Terry uh these sources for funding and

437
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,280
I'll be happy to take any questions

438
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,280
during the Q&A.

439
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,120
Well, thank you Holt. That was a great

440
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,480
talk and very very exciting data. Um, as

441
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,559
with the previous sessions, we're going

442
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,559
to do questions after the the next

443
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,240
speaker. We'll do it all together. Um,

444
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,760
so let me introduce you the next

445
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,320
speaker. It's a pleasure to introduce

446
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,679
Dr. Rashad Gupta. Raj Gupta is an

447
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,760
assistant professor of medicine at

448
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,480
Harvard Medical School with a research

449
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,960
lab um in the division of cardiovascular

450
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,559
medicine and genetics at Birkham Women's

451
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,960
Hospital and also here at the Broad

452
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,559
Institute and as a physician scientist

453
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,799
he is interested in how genetic

454
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,559
mutations affect vascular function

455
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,320
especially um to find uh new treatment

456
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,679
targets uh and that's what he's going to

457
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,520
talk uh about today um and a talk titled

458
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,360
toward a cure for several cavernous

459
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,600
malfformations genetic insight and

460
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,280
perturb seek in action. I'm very excited

461
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,640
about the inaction part, right? Yeah.

462
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,039
Thanks. Thanks so much for that

463
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,600
introduction. Um, is my mic on? Can you

464
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,000
hear me? Okay, perfect. Um, well,

465
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,480
wonderful. So I did my posttock here at

466
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,960
the broad institute uh many moons ago uh

467
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,799
with David Alt Schuler and the goal was

468
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,559
to identify the genetic drivers of

469
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,480
common diseases like coronary artery

470
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,679
disease and hypertension and that's what

471
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,160
I started my lab to study but by you

472
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,679
know sort of uh curiositydriven research

473
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,440
as Anna likes to say a lot um we

474
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,600
identified that there were these nodal

475
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,320
pathways shared between common vascular

476
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,720
diseases and rare vascular diseases and

477
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,799
so this community of ladders to cure has

478
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,679
sort of helped us hone in on is there

479
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,679
some therapeutic potential for insights

480
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,200
made from common vascular diseases on a

481
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,960
rare disease and that's the story I'm

482
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,799
going to share today. Okay. So the

483
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,360
disease that I'm going to uh talk to

484
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:28,159
everyone about uh is cerebral cavernous

485
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,400
malfforms. There's been a big uh um

486
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,000
focus on neuro degenerative disease

487
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,400
neuromuscular disease and this is a

488
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,480
neurovvascular disease and so it's

489
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,640
extremely rare. It's c there's a

490
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,799
mandelian form which is one in 5,000

491
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,640
people and then there's a sporadic form

492
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,520
which is one in 200 people. So more

493
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,919
common. The mandelian form is driven by

494
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,000
three mutations all named for the

495
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,360
disease they cause CCM1, CCM2 and

496
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,960
CCM3. And what you see in these

497
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,799
pictures, it's almost like a blood

498
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,760
blister of the brain. It's like a

499
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,400
enlargement of the venus uh structures

500
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,880
that results in these enlarged uh blood

501
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,559
vessels that can burst at any time. On

502
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,400
the right you see an MRI and each one of

503
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,440
those black dots shouldn't be there.

504
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,200
They can burst unpredictably and result

505
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,600
in uh hemoplegia, stroke and death. And

506
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,919
the only real proven therapy is

507
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,840
neurosurgery and it's a very painstaking

508
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,600
neurosurgery. Only the sort of most

509
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,360
skilled neurosurgeons the chief of

510
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,440
neurosurgery at children's hospital here

511
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,840
is one of the worldleading experts and

512
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,159
they have to sort of individually excise

513
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,080
each of these lesions and they don't

514
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,559
know which lesions are going to burst.

515
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,799
Many of the lesions form in inoperable

516
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,960
regions of the brain like the brain stem

517
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,280
which they can't go after surgically and

518
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,600
there's no therapies that delay or

519
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,200
reverse the

520
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,799
disease and so you know I got super

521
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,400
interested in this disease because of

522
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,240
our perturb seek work that I'm going to

523
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,480
share with you and so I asked every

524
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,039
neurologist in the city to send me their

525
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,799
CCM patients and somewhat embarrassed me

526
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,679
every time a patient comes sees me they

527
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,120
say so you're a neurosurgeon right and I

528
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,400
sort of have to say well no I'm actually

529
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,520
a cardiologist ologist. I'm just really

530
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,280
interested in this disease. I think we

531
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,120
could cure it one day. And so, you know,

532
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,880
some of my u you know, patients will

533
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,559
even say, "But you're still a

534
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,080
neurosurgeon, right?" Because they they

535
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,520
they, you know, believe that that's

536
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,159
really the only way to treat the

537
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,679
disease. And but the but the exciting

538
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,840
part that I like to explain to the

539
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,840
patients that I talk to is that their

540
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,840
rare disease is teaching us about the

541
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,679
common diseases of the blood vessels and

542
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,440
the other way around, right? And the

543
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,120
reason for this is the common diseases

544
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,120
that we study, right? like coronary

545
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,960
disease and hypertension. They're driven

546
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,880
by these small effects size variants

547
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,039
where we don't know the causal genes. We

548
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,960
often are assuming that like we know the

549
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,640
causal genes but are often wrong.

550
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,640
Whereas rare diseases like cerebral

551
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,679
cavernous malfforms or thoracic aortic

552
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,679
aneurysms are driven by rare variants

553
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,679
identified in familial studies and are

554
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,919
linked to severe phenotypes but they

555
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,240
both converge on the same nodal pathways

556
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,240
and in endothelial cells that's been

557
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,799
increasingly apparent from our perturbed

558
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,159
seek work. And what I'm excited about

559
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,919
and it's something that you know I think

560
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,840
is is you know we haven't talked about

561
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,400
it today but this sort of virtuous cycle

562
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,200
between rare and common disease right uh

563
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,039
when we did perturbse seek we only knew

564
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,039
the biology of the genes we were

565
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,799
identifying because of prior work in

566
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,640
rare disease and I think the rare

567
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,159
disease work is informing the common

568
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,720
disease work and hopefully the other way

569
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,400
around and so the outline of what I'll

570
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,840
present today are that um you know from

571
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,840
perturbse we have identified central

572
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,200
nodes for vascular disease risk and the

573
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,840
node that I'm going to talk about is the

574
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,679
regulation of KLF2 and 4 transcription

575
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,360
factors that are very involved in sheer

576
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,919
stress response the response of

577
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,440
endothelial cells to blood flow but you

578
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,240
know there's this opposite direction of

579
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,080
effect between CCM and CAD genetics and

580
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,280
so what are the insights we can make in

581
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,039
that um so finally the the work that was

582
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,360
funded by this latter secure seed

583
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,760
project was to define the causal pathway

584
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,520
for CCM better and that was to look for

585
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,280
cellular phenotypes with cell painting

586
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,600
you know work that JT Neil beautifully

587
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,600
presented today. And then finally, we've

588
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,159
sort of begun the effort to develop

589
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,240
therapies in this space. And so the work

590
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,799
that you know sort of motivated our our

591
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,480
entry into CCM was an endothelial cell

592
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,320
perturb screen that was done by Gavin

593
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Schnitzer and Helen Kang in our lab in

594
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,799
close collaboration with Jesse Enrightes

595
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,080
who's now at Stanford. And we were

596
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:24,640
trying to study the

597
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,720
228 non- lipid associated CAD genes that

598
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,480
were identified from GIWA studies. We

599
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,559
wondered if we could study all of the

600
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,440
possible causal genes in endothelial

601
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,360
cells at the same time. And so the the

602
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,000
project that we embarked on was

603
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,600
perturbing every possible causal gene.

604
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,159
So in a poolled format, use crisper eye

605
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,919
to knock down expression of of each one

606
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,600
of the possible causal genes within a

607
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,760
megabase of each of the G-W was variants

608
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,360
and then perform single cell RNA

609
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,960
sequencing to look for the

610
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,880
transcriptional effects of each of these

611
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,080
perturbations. So in the middle panel

612
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,799
you'll see that we were able to

613
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,080
successfully sequence 215,000 single

614
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,799
cells with 37,000 different guide RNAs

615
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,880
and 90 cells per target gene. And then

616
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,679
we then use methods that were developed

617
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,360
in

618
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:16,559
particulated gene networks from this

619
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,039
analysis. So you find like denovo which

620
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,440
genes have effects on which genetic

621
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,640
programs in in vitro. And you know

622
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,279
here's like sort of what we call the

623
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,679
wiring diagram of the endothelial cell

624
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:29,760
that's sort of denovo analyzed from our

625
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,919
perturb data right no assumptions are

626
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,760
made these are just the the genes that

627
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,520
travel together you know in our

628
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,400
experiment and you'll see that there's

629
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,000
50 co-regulated gene programs 37 of

630
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,480
which you would have found in any cell

631
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,279
type u they affect like common processes

632
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,360
like cell cycle or ribosomal biology but

633
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,520
13 of the programs are endothelial cell

634
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,120
specific and they are in the sort of

635
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,000
pathways that you would expect to be

636
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,799
associated with vascular diseases. And

637
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,760
the one one of these programs topic 8 or

638
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:04,080
program 8 from our analysis was enriched

639
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:07,120
for CAD genetic risk. So 41 of the 241

640
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,880
CAD risk variants all converged on this

641
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,279
pathway. And the pathway is sort of

642
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,000
shown here in this

643
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:15,919
cartoon. Genes that were upstream of KF2

644
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,720
and 4, which is sort of the nodal piece

645
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,880
of the pathway. um they're in a a

646
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,400
pathway called the CCM pathway. And that

647
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,200
that's that's sort of depicted in the

648
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,840
middle of the of the diagram, but genes

649
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,000
upstream and downstream of KF2 sort of

650
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,360
unite to show genetic enrichment for all

651
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,559
of these uh variants. And so uh one of

652
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,480
these genes is CCM2 itself. And we had

653
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,720
never heard of CCM2. We' never sort of

654
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,400
heard about the disease itself. But what

655
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,039
we were seeing is that loss of function

656
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,200
of C CCM2 and other genes in that

657
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,440
complex were protective for coronary

658
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,960
artery disease. So now we sort of after

659
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,679
reading the literature we had this sort

660
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,720
of dilemma. The literature is telling us

661
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,480
that large rare deletions in CCM2 were

662
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,720
causing this severe neurovvascular

663
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,039
disorder. But then when you look at a

664
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,039
common misssense mutation in that same

665
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,760
gene, it's protective for coronary

666
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,440
disease. And so our ladder secure

667
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,360
project was to really confirm these

668
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,919
opposite directionalities, really see if

669
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,480
that's true and to better define these

670
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,799
phenotypes. And so to begin with, why is

671
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,799
there opposite directionality? So on on

672
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,000
the right you see work done by Mark

673
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,760
Khan's lab at the University of

674
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,919
Pennsylvania where they made the CCM

675
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,760
knockout mouse model and they made it

676
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,080
for a crit one knockout which is also

677
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,080
CCM1 which you see in the top right and

678
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,679
then in the bottom left is the CCM2

679
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,760
knockout. You see these brain lesions

680
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,559
that are forming in the cerebellum. When

681
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,720
they knock out mech 3, which is just up

682
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,960
downstream of the CCM pathway, it's the

683
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,120
sort of kinace cascade regulated by this

684
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,600
complex. They rescue it. So they cure it

685
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,840
in mice by knockout of mech 3. So they

686
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,880
say that the pathogenesis of the brain

687
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,080
disease is high KF2. And we also think

688
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,760
that's the protective effect in CAD. So

689
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,279
why could this be? Why are there these

690
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,039
opposite directionalities? It could be

691
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,039
that there's specific biology at that

692
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,480
misssense mutation. It could be that

693
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,159
there's a difference between complete

694
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,960
and partial loss of function, sort of a

695
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,960
do dosage effect. It could be because

696
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,640
arterial and venus ECs respond

697
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,919
differently to mutations. And it could

698
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,240
be because there's a difference between

699
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,360
developmental effects and adult effects.

700
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,039
These are the kind of questions that

701
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,120
will probably take my lab the next 10

702
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,120
years to study. But I think they're

703
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,799
really important and exciting. And so

704
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,559
just to begin with what have we done

705
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:29,120
like with with the broad community and

706
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,360
the ladders to cure community is that

707
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,640
you know we found that the the coding

708
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,279
mutation that's associated with

709
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,240
decreased CAD risk is at this one spot

710
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,399
in the CCM protein and you know its

711
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,320
minor alo frequency is 8%. So it

712
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,760
probably doesn't affect risk of a rare

713
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,000
disease but the CCM causing mutations

714
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,320
are all sort of on the C terminus end

715
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,919
they affect maybe other properties and

716
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,520
so what are those other properties? Are

717
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,720
there different proteins that bind at

718
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,880
each site? And one of the things that

719
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,399
binds on that C terminus end is a new

720
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,320
protein that had never been linked to

721
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,600
this complex. It's an orange hair. It's

722
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,520
called Q1RD1. Um so our hypothesis was

723
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,960
that different cellular mechanisms may

724
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,960
respond may be responsible for CAD or

725
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,600
CCM. And so to sort of unlock this, we

726
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,000
use the cell painting or variant editing

727
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,559
approach that JT Neil nicely introduced,

728
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,559
right? They use machine learning of of

729
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,880
microscopy images to identify the

730
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,320
effects of different mutations and they

731
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,760
have standard cell painting and then

732
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,480
variant cell painting which you heard

733
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:34,399
about earlier today. So we kind of ran

734
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,799
through a lot of mutant alals in CCM and

735
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,039
what you see is the reference al for CCM

736
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,520
at the bottom. The wild type AL results

737
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,159
in cytoplasmic localization of CCM.

738
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,880
Right? All the green all the GFP tag CCM

739
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,039
is all in the cytoplasm. But a specific

740
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,480
variant al at the C terminus end of the

741
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,399
protein this isolucine 432 to thrienine

742
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,159
changes the localization completely.

743
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,159
It's sort of one of the examples JT

744
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,520
talked about that now it's more nuclear

745
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,440
localization. A different amino acid

746
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,679
change at that same residue has no

747
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,159
effect. It's still cytoplasmically

748
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,000
located. And so you know now we want to

749
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,679
expand that. So we finding specific

750
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,080
phenotypes for disease associated

751
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,240
mutations for the rare disease that

752
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,679
aren't seen with the common disease and

753
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,840
now we want to see if like all the

754
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,120
mutation all the genes in this pathway

755
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,039
have similar morphologic effects. So uh

756
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,279
GIA a new post document in my lab has

757
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,720
sort of run this analysis and this is uh

758
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:31,279
you know work we did you know with the

759
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,039
imaging platform here to knock out all

760
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,600
of the sort of topic eight genes that

761
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:37,360
were enriched for CAD and all of the CCM

762
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,360
genes and they don't all cluster

763
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,320
together in perturbse seek they all show

764
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,320
the same transcriptional phenotype but

765
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,080
morphologically they cluster separately

766
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,640
and so finally I want to just spend the

767
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,039
last few minutes talking about you know

768
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:54,399
is there an opportunity for therapies

769
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:56,159
that target what we've learned and so we

770
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,760
we want to make the case that we could

771
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,520
repurpose a drug that was actually

772
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,520
developed by Nat Gray when he was here

773
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,360
at the Broad and Dana Farber. It's an

774
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,399
IRK 5 inhibitor. It's part of this

775
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,399
pathway. And so uh the cartoon here are

776
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,360
all the sort of functions of the CCM

777
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,279
complex. Uh you see CCM 1, CCM2, and

778
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,799
CCM3. They bind each other. They bind

779
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,480
mech 3. They affect KF2 and 4. Our data

780
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,559
suggests that's the mechanism of

781
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,799
disease. But the current therapies in

782
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,880
development are targeting peripheral

783
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,840
mechanisms. There's a clinical trial in

784
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,159
in progress to target uh to use statins

785
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,279
which target HMG co-red reductase sort

786
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,039
of not a central member of this

787
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:36,480
complex recursion with work that was

788
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,200
actually done here at the broad with an

789
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,440
carpenter is using templ which re which

790
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,279
uh targets reactive oxygen species and

791
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,760
then other companies are making rock

792
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,440
inhibitors for this disease and like I

793
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,279
said those are sort of in that dotted

794
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,440
circle they affect stress fiber

795
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,120
formation that's an important mechanism

796
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,960
of disease but we don't think that's the

797
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,559
central mechanism. That's not the node

798
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,880
that keeps showing up in all of our

799
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,360
experiments. The node is really the

800
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,600
genes that are driving disease risk. And

801
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,320
so if we wanted to target that, we found

802
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,000
in the literature that um Nat Gray, a

803
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,960
great chemist who had made protac

804
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,399
molecules for uh KK one and two for

805
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,240
cancer had made an IRK 5 Proac. And Nat

806
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,840
Gray is so famous that even if he shows

807
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,919
his compound does nothing, he can

808
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,000
publish it in cell chemical biology,

809
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,240
which he did very nicely. Right? So this

810
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,880
is a uh they made the compound. It was

811
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,519
extremely specific um as you see in the

812
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,679
bottom right RNA seek and it was uh a

813
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,120
very potent inhibitor of ver 5 and

814
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,880
downstream signaling but it had no

815
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,679
effect on cancer. So then they stopped

816
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:40,399
working on it. Um but we think that you

817
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,799
know we have knockout cells CCM2 and

818
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,960
T1rd1 knockout cells that are resistant

819
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,320
to sheer stress. They they demonstrate

820
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,720
some of the phenotypes that you'd

821
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,039
expect. And so at the bottom kind of the

822
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,399
most striking phenotype is that the CCM2

823
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,720
and TRD1 cells have like stronger stress

824
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:59,279
fibers and uh right above that you see

825
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,960
that even with flow the wild type cells

826
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,760
will all align but the knockout cells

827
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,519
sort of retain this disorganized

828
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,360
pattern. And so we tested their five

829
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,960
protac and you know there is a

830
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,320
therapeutic range where you could take

831
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,440
the CKO or CCM2 knockout cells and they

832
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,279
will normalize KF2 expression whereas

833
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,519
wild type cells will have like a minimal

834
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,159
response to KF2 expression. So we found

835
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,720
this to sort of be a a possible targeted

836
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,200
therapy to the central mechanism that

837
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,519
that might be promising for CCM and we'd

838
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,960
like to expand that work. And so I'll

839
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,720
end by saying our you know we're just

840
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,960
kind of scratching the surface of how

841
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,799
nodal biology could affect one rare

842
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,440
disease and one common and multiple

843
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,360
common diseases but to go forward we

844
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,200
want to develop invivo perturbse seek

845
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,919
methods to identify the co-regulated

846
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,600
networks in a disease context um and

847
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,760
we're starting along those lines you

848
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,960
know uh with aavs that target

849
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,440
endothelial cells that were actually

850
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,519
made by the deman lab here we've been

851
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,000
able to get pretty good expression in a

852
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,080
crisper eye mouse we want to determine

853
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,559
the different invivo effects of CAD and

854
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,039
CCM associated mutations. We want to

855
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,960
test the efficacy of this first compound

856
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:12,000
for you know possible um lesion uh uh

857
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,440
resolution in mice that get CCM disease.

858
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,800
And then finally I didn't have time to

859
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,320
talk about this but we've we've

860
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,639
partnered with the foundation. So

861
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,720
there's a alliance to cure cavernous

862
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,960
malf formations that kind of enrolls all

863
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,639
the patients who have this disease and

864
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,200
we want to now that we have perturbed

865
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,720
seek data we could take all the genotype

866
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,599
negative families and see if they have

867
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,480
mutations in in related genes to this

868
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,760
this pathway and so with that I'll thank

869
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,919
the people who did the work Gavin

870
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,839
Schnitzer Helen Kang led the perturbse

871
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,919
and multiple members of our lab Jesse

872
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,760
Angry's lab u has been really

873
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:45,679
instrumental in almost all the work and

874
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,520
we uh always thank the families that

875
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,909
have contributed samples and their time

876
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,439
to this research. Thanks.

877
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:54,439
[Applause]

878
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,079
Thank you so much for this talk. I want

879
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,520
the two speakers maybe to join me up

880
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,040
here. Uh and we'll starting our Q&A

881
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,359
session. Just go and grab a microphone

882
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,119
if there's any

883
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:08,960
questions. If there's none for now, I'll

884
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,119
start. Um hold I have a question for

885
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,440
you. Um you kind of in the beginning

886
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,599
kind of presented that you know you have

887
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,359
a disease you have a gene you have the

888
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,720
mutations and then you tried with base

889
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,960
editing but they were offt targets

890
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,320
effect and then one maybe works the

891
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,160
other one didn't and then you went to

892
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,040
prime editing. Do you think that would

893
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,880
kind of be the pathway forward for you

894
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,960
know if I have a gene of interest then

895
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,280
that would be kind of the pathway that u

896
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,160
that everybody has to go through. Yeah,

897
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,160
I would say um and this happens quite

898
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,200
often in our lab where people will you

899
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,520
know see a mutation

900
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,119
and at least try base editing. It's

901
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,040
possible that you know even if it's like

902
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,079
two nucleotides away if the window is

903
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,200
just right you can get just on target

904
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,720
without any bystander. Um and that

905
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,320
sometimes surprises us too like

906
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,680
sometimes we'll make calls like oh

907
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,960
there's no way base editing will work

908
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,760
but let's just try it anyway. And

909
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,920
surprisingly it does. Um but yeah, I

910
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,079
would say given the additional maybe

911
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,839
experimental requirements and throughput

912
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:11,040
for prime editing, we usually put that

913
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:13,800
as a a second second choice. But let's

914
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,640
say prime editing will get more and more

915
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,880
efficient. Uh would that maybe overtake

916
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,960
the base editing? Yeah, that's that's a

917
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,800
that's an interesting question and we

918
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,520
certainly hope it will get there. I

919
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,320
think um now we're starting to see where

920
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,640
our most optimized uh prime edits can

921
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,880
start to hit the levels of like some of

922
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,280
the earlier base editors. We're still

923
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,920
the base editors are still just like

924
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,920
monsters at daminating DNA and actually

925
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,240
for those actually offtargets become

926
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,720
much more of a problem. Uh so prime

927
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,440
editing is much better uh due to sort of

928
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,119
the three successive DNA hybridization

929
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,280
events that have to happen in the

930
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,599
mechanism for offtarget limitations.

931
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,119
Yeah.

932
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,200
I had a question for Raj. I was

933
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,560
wondering if whether in the CCM patients

934
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,720
or the mice if you studied the arterial

935
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,640
endothelial cells, what phenotypes would

936
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,040
you see? Yeah, that's a great question.

937
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,480
So, um the the we're studying that in

938
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,720
the lab because that's like sort of the

939
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,440
best evidence that there's a different

940
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,680
protective effect and the short answer

941
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,480
is we see a protective effect in the CCM

942
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,960
hetererozygous mice. Homozygous CCM2

943
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,079
knockout mice don't survive in germline.

944
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,520
Uh inducible CCM2 knockout mice exist

945
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,359
and they can survive. We haven't studied

946
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,920
them, but we thought a hetererozygous

947
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:33,040
mice mimic the effect of like a modest

948
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,680
germline uh common mutation. And she

949
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,839
fang in my lab is is got really nice

950
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,839
data that they get less a less vascular

951
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:43,839
inflammation. Um so you do see that loss

952
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,040
of function, you know, modest loss of

953
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:50,040
function is having a protective effect.

954
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,040
Yeah.

955
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,359
Hi. Uh, I'm Ashley Connor at Microsoft

956
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,760
in the Broad. I really appreciated both

957
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,920
of your talks. I had a question about

958
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,400
the relationship that you drew between

959
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,800
identifying mechanisms that allow you to

960
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,800
draw parallels between rare and common

961
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,480
disease. Mhm. Have you thought about

962
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,560
ways or have you identified any patterns

963
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,240
that will allow us to help making those

964
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,400
relationships as we think about

965
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,800
therapeutic strategies that might allow

966
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,960
us to kind of shift between applications

967
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,640
in rare and common disease space? Yeah,

968
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,640
that's a that's a great question and

969
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,079
Anna Anna has like great experience with

970
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,640
this as well and I think we're all

971
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,520
trying to do this to some extent. Um,

972
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:33,760
our approach was like cellular genetics.

973
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:36,160
So perturb seek um identify pathways and

974
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,960
nodes you know using perturbation in a

975
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,280
relevant cell type and then you'll see

976
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,440
this convergence of genetic risk on

977
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,520
certain pathways and then the pathways

978
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,000
are probably already described from rare

979
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,760
disease. So that's like a more laborious

980
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,760
way of doing things. I think it requires

981
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,560
this sort of you know high throughput

982
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,920
cellular phenotyping. Um but we're just

983
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,760
talking about transcriptional pathways

984
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,079
there. What about like morphologic

985
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,640
pathways? Well, maybe like variant cell

986
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,599
editing and and microscopy could do

987
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,440
that. Um, and then uh you know, I think

988
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,920
you could harness the pleotropy of

989
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,760
varants, right? So, um, as more

990
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,200
sequencing becomes available, maybe you

991
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,680
could just find it from like lots of

992
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,280
sequencing of biioanks. UK bio bank's

993
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,920
not really powered yet for something

994
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,680
like CCM but we would expect that there

995
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,640
should be like convergence of certain

996
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,880
mutations on like hemorrhagic stroke and

997
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,119
CAD risk but it's just not powered yet

998
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,520
with only 500,000 but maybe at like a

999
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,520
million two million it would be. Thank

1000
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,520
you.

1001
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,880
Hi. So, I had a question about the

1002
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,359
efficacy between the um the hacksaw

1003
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,400
models that you were using and the mouse

1004
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,920
models. And I thought it was I mean I

1005
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,400
thought it was super exciting that the

1006
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,320
efficacy was so high in the mouse

1007
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,560
models. And I was wondering

1008
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,280
um I mean I was wondering what

1009
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,359
challenges there are like going forward

1010
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,359
with efficacy like on the mouse model

1011
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:10,000
side compared to the yeah compared to in

1012
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,160
in vitro. Yeah that's a that's a good

1013
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,839
question. It's always um you know a

1014
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,920
little bit disappointing when we do all

1015
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:18,720
this work in the hexel and then it just

1016
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,960
doesn't translate always. Um,

1017
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,800
fortunately we do have some approaches

1018
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,040
now that allow us to to elevate

1019
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,800
efficiency in more primary types. Um,

1020
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,880
but yeah, your your question about I

1021
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,800
guess translating from in vitro to

1022
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:37,200
invivo editing is is is a hard one and I

1023
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,839
would say that um for us we typically

1024
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,000
try to assess

1025
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,000
um in the most advanced system possible

1026
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,480
and as early as possible just to get a

1027
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,960
sense of what those challenges might be.

1028
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:53,040
Um and and whether um I guess there

1029
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,400
there are alternative editing strategies

1030
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,280
that you might want to pursue or

1031
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,280
prioritize. Yeah.

1032
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Question. Um so regarding the the prime

1033
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,560
editing um in vivo introduction of uh

1034
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,040
indelss even though it's a a fairly low

1035
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,000
number is this something that you're

1036
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,400
concerned with and is there anything um

1037
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,880
in the mechanism of how they get

1038
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,800
introduced that you could try to

1039
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,800
leverage as a way to minimize them?

1040
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,760
Yeah, that's a that's a a good question.

1041
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:30,599
So I think

1042
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:32,960
um so for one of the mouse models we had

1043
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,319
um I don't want to go too much into the

1044
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,079
detail about the the specific

1045
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,119
complexities of the prime editing system

1046
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:42,480
but um one of the mouse models had what

1047
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,119
we call like a PE3B nicking. So we have

1048
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:47,839
a second guide RNA that nicks the

1049
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,400
opposite strand to bias DNA repair. And

1050
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,720
in some cases that nick can be

1051
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,440
selectively introduced only after the

1052
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,200
edit has been introduced. And so when we

1053
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,680
use that type of strategy we typically

1054
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,760
see very low induls in vivo. Um but for

1055
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,839
the other mouse model where we didn't

1056
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,760
have you know that requirement that the

1057
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,000
mutation already be corrected followed

1058
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,599
by nicking and it just nicked elsewhere

1059
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,960
we actually observed much higher indul.

1060
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,160
So something that we're following up on

1061
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,480
that to to reduce uh the number uh that

1062
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,599
percentage is to you know modify the

1063
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:25,680
strategy to to have that second nick uh

1064
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,520
be concurrent. Um I will say that uh I

1065
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,920
guess it you know will certainly depend

1066
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,599
on your particular disease of interest

1067
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,440
whether uh I guess indel mediated say

1068
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,480
nonsense mediated decay might you know

1069
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,000
be relevant for your your particular um

1070
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,040
protein. Um, but at least I think as

1071
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,240
long as it's leading to

1072
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,960
non-functional variants that are just I

1073
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,520
guess truncated um that don't compete

1074
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,560
then that that might be okay depending

1075
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,160
on the disease as well.

1076
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,000
Okay. Well, I wanted to thank the

1077
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,760
speakers for two excellent talks and for

1078
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,720
all the work they do. Thanks for the

1079
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,720
discussion and we can move on.
