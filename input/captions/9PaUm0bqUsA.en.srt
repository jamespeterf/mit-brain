years

48
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:46,440
and Partnerships were built on a mutual

49
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,440
respect and common goals and became uh

50
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,239
Stronger since then uh our interests

51
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,360
have changed from time to time and

52
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,840
different research topics for example

53
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,360
inspection and measurement uh new

54
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,360
materials new devices and the new

55
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:08,879
semiconductors but then MTL covers a

56
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,000
wide range of research topics that is

57
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,560

knows soch is the largest manufacturer

112
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,880
of engineer

113
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:54,759
substrate uh we are a little bit younger

114
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:57,400
than uh MTL 34 years old uh or 33 um and

115
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,599
uh similarly we have started uh the

116
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,000
company is known for SOI manufacturer uh

117
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:07,039
we started with silicon but in the last

118
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,280
5 10 years we Diversified into new

119
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:15,080
materials Gan and uh ptic materials and

120
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,280
some other compounds um so in the in the

121
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,599
in the history uh we we had many

122
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:24,639
collaborations with MIT especially on so

123
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:28,560
SOI um and uh we decided recently uh

124
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,919
2023 uh to join MTL and already working

125
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,440
with couple of uh faculty members and

126
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,639
looking forward to expand to to more uh

127
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,280
more Technologies and more

128
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:41,120
opportunities uh one of the reason we uh

129
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,840
we decided to engage with MTL is uh

130
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,440
diversity of the research topics you you

131
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,120
have and this fits pretty well with our

132
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,080
strategy uh to to further develop and

133
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,000
Advance uh innov Innovative materials

134
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,790
thank you and congratulation for for the

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,720

[Applause]

137
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,400
and the next speaker is Jim Weiser from

138
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,400
Texas

139
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,280
instrument well first of all I'd like to

140
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,680
uh congratulate MTL in their 40 Years of

141
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,800
success and hopefully another 40 Years

142
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,879
of success in new technologies that have

143
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,919
come out from Texas ins standpoint uh

144
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,960
I've been involved primarily only about

145
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,080
10 years because I came across from

146
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,760
National stor acquisition but it's been

147
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,919
enlightening to work with MTL and the

148
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,599
one word I have to say for them is micro

149
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,080
system which is part of their name it's

150
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,159
spanning from devices through systems

151
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,440
and software and so forth that's one of

152
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,200
the attractions that we have for we've

153
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,040
gained benefit from looking at devices

154
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,480
our Gan technology which is now

155
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,240
commercialized had roots in MIT and MTL

156
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,760
and then the other aspect of it is the

157
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,000
ecosystem that we get access to from a

158
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,839
Technologies and research standpoint but

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,279
also from the other relationships that

160
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,600
MTL has and MIT has with other companies

161
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,120
that maybe are customers for us and had

162
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,279
three-way collaborations and research

163
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,760
which have been very useful from

164
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:21,959
anywhere from medical and in industrial

165
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,040
applications and so forth uh we look

166
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:27,480
forward to what MTL can do next we're

167
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,680
looking forward to the life sciences if

168
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,279
anybody was here yesterday and how that

169
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,320

his research is tackling the critical

211
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,560
challenges in Advanced Materials uh so

212
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,920
let's give a warm welcome to these

213
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,480
speakers uh as they share their

214
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,600
inspiring work let's start from gan

215
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,079
[Applause]

216
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,120
okay thank you so much for having me

217
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:38,959
here uh I am 10 years older than Mt so

218
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,320
so caliz me as a young faculty member

219
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:45,519
I'm I really appreciate that so and yeah

220
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,320
it's my 10th year in MIT and um today

221
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,959
I'd like to yeah so I'd like to

222
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,240
introduce our my La of you know activity

223
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:57,200
on material Innovation for Next gener 3D

224
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,760
integration so I put it uh the the title

225
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,880
as a simless wher free monel to 3D so

226
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,399
what I'm going to talk about today is

227
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,560
why material Innovation is so so so

228
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,639
important to to build three dimensional

229
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,079
chips okay so please have a look at this

230
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:16,399
uh 3dh so you know if you're um the

231
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:18,079
member of MTL you must you know you

232
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,240
should be very familiar with this you

233
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:24,440
know uh right now we don't have the uh

234
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,120
you know uh space for for for um

235
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,720
integrating the memory and logic anymore

236
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,600
and we try to go go vertically also for

237
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,480
efficient communication between logic

238
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,240
and memory you know instead of going

239
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,120
laterally we want to go vertically so to

240
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,279
do so conventional way to

241
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,480
um should I do

242
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,480
this okay so I better do

243
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:53,720
this okay so conventional way to uh

244
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:55,760
integrate the chips vertically is all

245
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,680
most of cases will be done by tsv

246
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,680
through silicon VR process right the

247
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,920
reason is that first in order for you to

248
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,120
have high quality high performance

249
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,160
devices you would need to have single

250
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,480
crystalling devices in order for you to

251
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,839
have a single cryst devices you need to

252
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,560
have single cry wafer so wafer is

253
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,600
necessary building block for for for uh

254
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,680
having the high quality logic and memory

255
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,680
materials on it after that you really

256
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,120
want to vertically connect them each

257
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,800
other then you cannot help but dring the

258
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,639
hole through the wafer like like you can

259
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,720
see here here that is called the uh

260
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,000
where is my CER yeah called the uh you

261
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,560
know tsp process we utilize tsv process

262
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,720
through the whole through the wafer we

263
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,519
fill the Gap with the copper then by

264
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,760
doing so um it you know we are able to

265
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,079
stack the chip vertically but there's

266
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,279
ton of ton of

267
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:52,040
limitation especially there's a

268
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,839
limitation alignment because you finish

269
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,920
the chip already you finish the chip

270
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,600
already then you would need to align

271
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,959
each chip area each device so alignment

272
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,399
problem Sor not only that stacking the

273
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:07,120
chip during the hold through the wafer

274
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:10,000
is is not is is not trivial task so we

275
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,399
already know this is really problematic

276
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,759
process but there there's no other way

277
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,279
to do so but you know the architect

278
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,519
architecture Community they have been

279
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:24,399
calculating what's going to happen if we

280
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,480
connect the chip without having any rfer

281
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,000
what if we make some sub Micron you know

282
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,440
pitch interconnect among the among the

283
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,440
devices then what they found is that

284
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,279
they could substantially reduce the

285
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,880
power others are made to lower and they

286
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,560
could boost the performance others

287
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,199
augmented to higher so that has been

288
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,320
calculated already that has been

289
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:49,120
simulated already but the

290
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,519
community you know do not have the much

291
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,160
option to do this wafer free mon 3

292
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,120
integration when I say mon 3D

293
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,959
integration that means you do the 3D

294
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,079
integration without having any wafer

295
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:03,680
okay so there's option for you know mon

296
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:06,639
3D integration but it's not easy so in

297
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:09,000
order for us to do the W for free thre

298
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,480
Dimension integration you know this

299
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,279
could be done by two different method

300
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,279
again you really want to do the monor 3D

301
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,120
of a single Crystal material to make a

302
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,759
advanced logic transistor okay to do so

303
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,880
you need to grow you would you may be

304
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,279
able to grow single crystalline Channel

305
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,880
material on the amers on the back end of

306
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:34,040
the line finish it wafer or you may want

307
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,120
to transfer single crystalling device

308
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:40,079
material from other wafer to the another

309
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,800
wafer and and in this case you peel off

310
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,920
the active device layer for from one one

311
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,800
other wafer to the finished electron

312
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,839
circuitry what is so special about this

313
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,040
here's the thing monol the integration

314
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,519
you provide the material first on the

315
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,319
circuit Tre that's a key you provide the

316
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:00,920
material first on the circuit Tre then

317
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:03,560
you can align your devices towards the

318
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:07,560
underlying circuitry compared to tsv

319
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:10,839
technique this could

320
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,560
enable fine featured interconnect up to

321
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:16,519
the hundreds of nanometer which is

322
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,519
amazing but big challenges material

323
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:22,279
first how can you grow single Crystal

324
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:26,079
material on back end of the line finish

325
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:29,480
wafer the surface of B wafer V fin wafer

326
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:32,480
is composed of Amo Force insulate

327
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,959
and poly chring metal interconnect how

328
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,440
can you grow inry material on it right

329
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,240
that is a big question also how can you

330
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,120
grow single cryst material at the

331
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,079
temperature lower than

332
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,839
400° where the copper inter interconnect

333
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,199
could survive

334
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:52,120
right so this already you know sounds

335
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:55,160
like really really tough task then then

336
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,600
okay then you may want to peel off the

337
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,519
circuit Tre or peel off the material

338
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,959
then transfer onto circuit

339
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,120
this sounds little easier than grow okay

340
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,480
so here's a strategy that we do in in

341
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,000
microed MIT right

342
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,520
so on the left hand side I demonstrate

343
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,079
the our you know schematics about the

344
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,760
growth based monity 3D integration

345
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:22,520
meaning that if you control the kinetics

346
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,480
and thermodynamics during the growth you

347
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,640
can really grow single cryst material on

348
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,799
armorers here here's a very reap idea if

349
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,039
you comine the nucleation in very narrow

350
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,400
small area selectively that you can

351
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,840
comine the nuclei inside this this

352
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,039
trench okay so you have a single nuclear

353
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,120
in one trench then this trench is small

354
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,880
enough that you can just do a little bit

355
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,039
of lateral growth then you could do the

356
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,640
grand boundary free perfect single Mater

357
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:53,080
onop this is the first demonstration of

358
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,440
of growing single cryst oners at a

359
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:59,200
temperature lower than 400° C like I

360
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,799
mentioned if we secure this technology

361
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,280
you could do the really growth based mon

362
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:06,280
3 integration meaning that you can stack

363
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:07,679
the chip by the growth you don't have to

364
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,960
bond you don't have to drill the hole

365
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,840
through the wafer another way to do so

366
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,600
is you grow perfect s material on the

367
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,320
substrate that you can peel them off it

368
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:21,559
can transfer as you just have seen it if

369
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:23,039
you have graphing Cod is sub straight

370
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,760
then you can still do the epex by

371
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,280
following the underlying softs Crystal

372
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,280
information this is what it is so even

373
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,840
if there's a monin you can still do the

374
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,840
epital growth on graphine on the

375
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,600
substrate then why B you do this if you

376
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,280
once you grow perfect s material on

377
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,360
graphine you can peel them off okay this

378
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:45,080
technique has been uh you know

379
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,280
discovered in in 2015 MIT then uh we

380
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,600
found the way to utilize it for the mon

381
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,400
integration as you can see we grow

382
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:56,360
single material on graphine then we peel

383
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:00,120
them off this sing material could be gum

384
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:03,159
Mar IND Force any 35 any3 nitrate gum

385
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,600
nitrate alumium nitrate and complex

386
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,880
oxide lithium lithium niobate or or or

387
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,159
lithium tantalite all sorts of compound

388
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,919
material could be grown grapping and

389
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:17,559
paed off okay then here the uh you know

390
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:21,400
impact area of this this our unique mon

391
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:23,840
3D technique so by utilizing this

392
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,080
confined growth technique and remote app

393
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,880
technique you could make the 3D logic

394
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,600
and memory by The Grow now by the tsp

395
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,960
also you could do the AI Hardware

396
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,360
Advanced AI Hardware by stacking by

397
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,880
stacking the uh you know memory and

398
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,640
logic in very in in in close Manner and

399
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,039
you can can revolutionize display

400
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,240
technology as well because you could do

401
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,600
the RGB stacking so then you can do the

402
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:53,559
arv kind of micity system and also you

403
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,159
can produce ultra thin single membrane

404
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,159
that can you can wear that Ultra

405
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,080
membrane on your body or you can

406
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,159
Revolution photonics and sensing so I'm

407
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,080
going to briefly touch upon all of this

408
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,640
technology we have developed so far or

409
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,440
this six different areas based on our

410
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,120
monolitic 3D integration scheme which is

411
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:14,280
completely based on Material Science

412
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:17,520
okay so here you're looking at the first

413
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,960
demonstration of vertical seos done by

414
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,200
the grow not by the stacking the wafer

415
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,919
you're looking at the uh you know MOS

416
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,200
pimos single CST underneath by the grow

417
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,159
on on half oxide cor silicon wafer then

418
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,799
we fin

419
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:35,200
the integration of pimos pimos on it

420
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,120
then we we encapsulate this with the

421
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,360
oxide then we grow perfect single

422
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:46,039
crystalline OS again on top okay this

423
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,679
integration was done just simply by the

424
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:51,039
growth at the temperature L 400 Dees is

425
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:54,320
all the circuit is survived so then we

426
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,679
are able to demonstrate foros OS pimos

427
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,120
you can already tell by utilizing this

428
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,320
you can double the denser of the

429
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,760
transistor right so this is just

430
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,080
beginning of you know showing the impact

431
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,159
of this growth based monolith 3

432
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,400
integration so what could happen in the

433
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,400
future you could you could build the

434
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,159
threedimensional memory right so like

435
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,120
hbm currently to to construct hbm what

436
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,679
needs to happen is that you would need

437
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,840
to thin down the wafer after the

438
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,480
integration Dam on Silicon wafer you

439
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,760
drill the ho through the wafer you you

440
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,799
do the copper interconnect and

441
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,120
bonding tsp process still problematic

442
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:34,760
maximum Stacks that you can make is 12

443
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,600
stack that was recently done by SK heix

444
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:40,480
but still is not enough for AI operation

445
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,840
okay so for that for that if you can

446
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,360
utilize this technique mon 3D by the

447
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,799
growth you can just have a DM stack by

448
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,520
the grow by The Grow then how could you

449
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:52,559
make this kind DM stack conventional DM

450
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:56,159
stack you cannot do conventional DM St

451
00:21:52,559 --> 00:22:00,200
all you got to do is to replace

452
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:03,240
our high electric with Ferro electric

453
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:07,520
High K di electrics that way you can

454
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,200
convert convert this transistor in onto

455
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,000
onto pH electric memory then you can

456
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,960
construct Chamis DRM out of it then you

457
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,480
can consecu speack them out by the grow

458
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,960
not by the transfer not by the tsv also

459
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,760
you could do the same process to have

460
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,919
the logic transistor vertically on and

461
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,200
on not by the transfer by The Grow okay

462
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:31,520
but here one thing that you you could

463
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,240
consider is a hit spreader right here's

464
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,480
the thing logic transistor generate a

465
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,360
ton of hit but if you only work with a

466
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,480
membranes you can put the heat spreader

467
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,559
right next to the membrane so that you

468
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,240
can effectively you know dissipate the

469
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,760
heat out of it so you may be able to

470
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,080
stack the logic consecutively that is

471
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,960
kind of exciting feature that we are

472
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:58,880
developing right now also AI solution so

473
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:01,640
in the industry in order to um

474
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,679
enhance the performance of AI chip what

475
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:07,720
they're trying to do is to put the logic

476
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:10,440
and memory close each other just keeping

477
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,640
the vman Computing method they just try

478
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:16,039
to put them together and closure each

479
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,320
other which is called the pin processing

480
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:20,080
in memory when they tape out the chip

481
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,799
when they tape out the logic transistor

482
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,960
no no when they tap the tape out the dam

483
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,440
they take out some portion of DRM then

484
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,159
replace that portion with the logic

485
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,799
transistor so then you can physically

486
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,200
put them together but you have to

487
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:35,200
sacrifice the area what this could be

488
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,840
done by the our method you can do memory

489
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,799
logic memory logic alteration by the

490
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:42,640
growth all right so that can be done

491
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:46,120
also our collaborator Pro s Li in

492
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:49,400
Georgia calculated even before the data

493
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:52,480
going out of the Asam if you can stack

494
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,880
Asam and logic together then you may not

495
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,919
need you may not need Advanced node

496
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,039
transistor for AI chip so here's a very

497
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,799
simple Ben Benchmark here you know um by

498
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,440
utiliz advanc no transist if you

499
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,840
construct AI chip which is mvidia Chip

500
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,840
it's uh band with is one t per second

501
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,120
but by utilizing this concept SRAM and

502
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,159
logic vertically stack that you could do

503
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,520
you could you could have a water made to

504
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:21,200
higher bandwidth even utilizing Lego

505
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,480
transistor that is the beauty of

506
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,640
exploring monolitic 3 integration okay

507
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,520
so that's my point also my lab is

508
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,960
working on you know non-conventional you

509
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,240
know for non noral Computing method

510
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,240
where we utilize a synapsis to do some

511
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,360
you know NE Computing task you know I

512
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,440
list up here if you hear about neic

513
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:45,039
Computing Computing memory in memory

514
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,679
Computing physical unit they're all same

515
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,919
time at least to us and the device for

516
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:52,960
this is nonvolatile memory or memory

517
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:56,799
sech or rram that's kind of like a

518
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,159
devices so here uh what we do is you so

519
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,960
far we've been developing Advan memoris

520
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:04,240
devices to to have the actual inference

521
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,360
task but so far because of these three

522
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,799
problems we have we are not able to

523
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,960
build the actual inference machine the

524
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,760
thing is that this switching mechanism

525
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,279
of nonb time memory is based on

526
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,600
stochastic you know Behavior so it's

527
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,760
very hard to have the uh you know

528
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,480
reliable switching operation also by

529
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,440
because of that there's a reduced

530
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,799
accuracy also the weight that you

531
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,960
register on the artificial synapsis

532
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:32,159
easily Decay because that's the nature

533
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,360
of the material so recently we try to

534
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,640
not utilize this you know memory

535
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,440
resource or RM or other number time

536
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,240
memory for this so so we thinking back

537
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,039
we think back you know why do we need to

538
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,960
program the arrays to do the inference

539
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,240
task what's the meaning of inference

540
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,399
task inference task means you already

541
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,399
know the

542
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:57,480
information information so you can

543
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:59,360
already register the wave value in

544
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,960
existing geometry you don't have to

545
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:07,880
program it if you utilize this kind of a

546
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:10,279
um register at the crossbar then you can

547
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,840
have super accurate stable inference

548
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:16,679
test we already demonstrate 8bit

549
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:18,799
operation of this AI Hardware that is

550
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:23,039
the best performance that has been ever

551
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,039
shown so so we point is that if you

552
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,399
point that you do not need to program

553
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,159
the race you can just pre-register the

554
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:31,640
pro program register then you can do the

555
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,399
inference test with very very high

556
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,279
accuracy that's kind of like air harder

557
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:38,799
that we are doing my le MIT next is

558
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:42,880
display based on mon3 integration like

559
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:45,200
like I mentioned current micro display

560
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,399
technology uh for especially for the

561
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,559
weable like arvr application you would

562
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:54,880
need to have 5,000

563
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:57,760
PPI display pixel density PPI 5,000 ppi

564
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,760
is needed but conventional L arrangement

565
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,799
of the chip chip RGB chip doesn't work

566
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:06,120
because of the you know um accuracy

567
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:09,440
alignment accuracy also manufactur

568
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,559
ability my lab try to utilize our remote

569
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,360
epex concept to do the monity 3D

570
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:17,520
integration by the transfer as you can

571
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,039
see Here We Grow red green blue LEDs on

572
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,960
graphing and peel them off we simply

573
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:26,480
stack them up first we transfer red LED

574
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,559
material that we integrate then we align

575
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,960
them each other by using mon inte ation

576
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,640
so with this we are able to

577
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,159
um based on that we are able to you know

578
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:40,440
collect all the pis in in MIT not only

579
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,399
for the micro LEDs but also for the QD

580
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,200
LEDs and and so on we recently launched

581
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:48,480
the MIT program on small display so I

582
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,519
hope you get an attention on this okay

583
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,480
so these are the sort of like um you

584
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:54,919
know area that we can visit by utilizing

585
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,880
this mon 3D integration lastly I'd like

586
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,600
to emphasize that by having this single

587
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,840
free membrane you can also revolutionize

588
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,880
the wear of electronics because you can

589
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,760
have perfect synch and Chip you can wear

590
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,600
that chip on the body impact is huge so

591
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,320
here I try to you know demonstrate the

592
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,760
impact of this free sending membrane by

593
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,159
the remote thexy impact of confined

594
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,440
growth to the mon through the

595
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:22,000
integration by the growth okay these are

596
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,360
my team at MIT my lab and they are

597
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,120
working hard to make this progress and

598
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:29,640
we have the uh three spin off one is for

599
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,159
the gum nital free membrane and the

600
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,480
other is this monity 3D integration by

601
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,960

to J Juan uh after the session and then

620
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,080
uh a lot of interesting discussions

621
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:34,799
thank

622
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,799
you so our next speaker is Kevin

623
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,640
O'Brien um so I'm really excited to be

624
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,279
here at at the MTL 40th anniversary to

625
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,120
talk about the research in my group the

626
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:49,519
uh Quantum coherent Electronics

627
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,919
group so uh you may have gone to the the

628
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:55,399
quantum track earlier and uh seen um

629
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,120
will Oliver's really nice analogy for

630
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:59,960
the state at which Quantum Computing is

631
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,760
at where um we're essentially at the

632
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:05,840
stage where um right after the first uh

633
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,760
right flyer is taking flight and uh the

634
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,399
industry is progressing the community is

635
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,320
progressing towards um useful commercial

636
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,559
Quantum computation but we're you know

637
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,880
closer to the to the right flyer than to

638
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:20,000
the the jumbo jet um so the question is

639
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,679
what fundamental science and engineering

640
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,120
advances do we need to to get there and

641
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,679
and that's what is um of interest in my

642
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,159
group particular um I'm really

643
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,840
interested in what are the fundamental

644
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,519
limits on device performance imposed by

645
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,240
the rules of quantum mechanics and how

646
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:37,760
can we actually not just know what these

647
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,039
limits are but how can we actually

648
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,960
engineer devices fabricate them measure

649
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:44,640
them to reach these limits and then can

650
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,600
those limits be surpassed are those

651
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,880
actually the real the real limits can

652
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:52,840
you figure out uh better ways to to um

653
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:56,000
surpass these um and I want to give a

654
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:59,039
couple examples um so for example can

655
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,799
Cubit readout be 10 times faster

656
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,559
um making Cubit read out fast is is

657
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:06,120
really important because right now

658
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:08,080
cubits are very lossy they decohere they

659
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,840
interact with their environment so to

660
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,519
realize a large scale error corrected

661
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,159
quantum computer you need to measure

662
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,840
these cubits and then perform

663
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:16,320
Corrections on them and the time it

664
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,000
takes to measure is a time in which

665
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,240
you're not doing this error correction

666
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,720
so it's it's important to measure them

667
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,360
very fast so the way you measure cubits

668
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,919
right now um I won't go into like all

669
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,960
all the all the physics of it but you B

670
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,519
basically have your Cubit you couple it

671
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,360
to a resonator for example with a

672
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,799
capacitor and the resonator will change

673
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,840
frequency depending on the state of the

674
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,600
Cubit then you send in a microwave pulse

675
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,799
or a microwave signal and measure the

676
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,919
phase associated with that resonator and

677
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,639
then that tells you the Cubit State and

678
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:47,600
right now this takes around 50 NCS which

679
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:50,080
is pretty good but not not where we want

680
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,320
to be so if you look at how the SNR of

681
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,320
this process scales it scales both with

682
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,399
the Decay rate of the resonator so how

683
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,480
large the resonator's linewidth is then

684
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,880
you can use a faster pulse and also with

685
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,519
the nonlinearity of this system meaning

686
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,760
like how much your cubit's response

687
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:09,240
changes in response to uh um additional

688
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,039
photons and the way if you look at the

689
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,279
different parameters of this scaling um

690
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:16,240
you might want to try making Cubit

691
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:18,200
readout Faster by just just driving it

692
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,000
harder using a stronger tone but that

693
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,320
excites your Cubit into some spous

694
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,240
states which isn't a good uh way of of

695
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,880
of doing it but if you increase the

696
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,440
nonlinearity and increase the the uh

697
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,519
Decay rate of your resonance

698
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,360
then you can increase your readout speed

699
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:36,159
in an unbounded way so this is what

700
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,200
we're interested in in doing and the way

701
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,519
that we've uh proposed uh to do this is

702
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,440
we develop kind of a cool type of uh

703
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,799
circuit called a a a Corton a purely

704
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,440
nonlinear coupler this is essentially if

705
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,720
you have a spring and a mass two masses

706
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,000
instead of putting a spring in the

707
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,080
middle just a normal spring we put this

708
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
this nonlinear spring which acts like

709
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,399
something that has infinite inductance

710
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,320
but it still gives you that type of

711
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,120
coupling you need for Cubit readout and

712
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,039
and this breaks the the trade-off that

713
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,880
you normally have in increasing this the

714
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,880
strength of this nonlinearity so we

715
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,840
proposed this device and we recently

716
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,200
experimentally demonstrated this and it

717
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,880
has the strongest nonlinearity the

718
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,720
strongest nonlinear light matter uh

719
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,159
interactions that's ever been measured

720
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,960
in any system including superconductors

721
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,639
and and you know all the all the other

722
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,240
systems uh which we think is really

723
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:28,679
exciting and now we're working towards

724
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,480
um using this for cubit readout to

725
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,399
instead of couple together two cubits to

726
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,200
couple together a cubit and a resonator

727
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:37,840
and use this to um uh realize 10x faster

728
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,320
than state-of-the-art readout which you

729
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,360
could check out our paper if you're

730
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:45,320
interested in um another problem that's

731
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,440
uh of of quite a lot of interest to

732
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,679
myself and my group is how well can you

733
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,799
amplify how well can you measure uh

734
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,760
Quantum signals using this super

735
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,440
conducting cubic platform and can we

736
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,039
reach the ultimate limits imposed by

737
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,559
quantum mechanics and it turns out that

738
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,039
indeed we can um and the the trick and

739
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,799
doing this over a broad bandwidth and

740
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:09,119
the trick is really matching the modes

741
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,399
of the free space to the modes of your

742
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,119
amplifier and using something called

743
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:16,000
flate Theory and this allows us to make

744
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:18,040
uh amplifiers that have near zero

745
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,480
dissipation and extremely high Quantum

746
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,119
efficiency uh these were fabricated at

747
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,280
MIT lincol laboratory in their sill

748
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,960
Foundry and when we characterize them we

749
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,599
find that uh intrinsic Quantum

750
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,200
efficiency of these amp amplifiers is is

751
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,679
around

752
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:38,040
98% now we also want to build these in

753
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,359
mit. Nano uh for a couple reasons one uh

754
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,960
shipping it out to a Foundry is is is

755
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:44,079
good especially if The Foundry is really

756
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,879
good like MIT lincol laboratory but it's

757
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,399
also good to have students involved in

758
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:49,520
the process to train the future

759
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,200
Workforce and it and just something

760
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,919
magical happens when you unleash

761
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,000
students on a problem and they can

762
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:57,040
really figure out tune all the knobs and

763
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,480
and and and figure out what's going on

764
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,400
so we developing in collaboration with

765
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,760
Will Oliver's group a 6 and 8 in uh

766
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,599
superc conducting Cubit process in mit.

767
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,119
Nano um we're using a lot of

768
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,240
state-of-the-art process Metrology

769
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,760
similar to what one does in the seos

770
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,480
industry uh for example uh we'll make

771
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,560
test Wafers of of of 80 40,000 880,000

772
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,200
Justice injunctions room temperature

773
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,119
probing of all of these and we're able

774
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,960
to get 100% yield in um for some of the

775
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,800
design parameters and then um we can get

776
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,599
less than 1% % Junction relative

777
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,440
standard deviation uniformity this is

778
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,280
important for precise targeting of

779
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:39,160
cubits and precise targeting of of of

780
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,640
amplifiers reducing their um Ripple um

781
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,119
so as a function of the different

782
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,359
Junction areas we can get these

783
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:48,640
state-of-the-art numbers in in mit. Nano

784
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,599
um you can also uh fabricate devices uh

785
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,240
for example this is an amplifier showing

786
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:56,520
over 20 DB gain um near Quantum limited

787
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:59,599
noise performance fabricated in in mit.

788
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,240
Nano um um one and you know we were

789
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,760
asked to kind of give our our our vision

790
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,240
and and philosophy so I want to one

791
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,680
thing that

792
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,280
um as when I'm teaching electrical

793
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,200
engineering one thing that I always find

794
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,920
challenging is the kind of high barrier

795
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,640
to entry I think um people find this a

796
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,280
lot in Hardware Fields where you know in

797
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,440
software students can just go download a

798
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,480
GitHub repo and be doing

799
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,520
state-of-the-art machine learning but in

800
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,119
you know Hardware it's often more

801
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,720
expensive uh more challenging so I find

802
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,200
that in research as well I think that

803
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,880
developing open- Source uh Eda for

804
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,000
Quantum is is very important um and you

805
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,520
know this isn't something just thought

806
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,640
by me a lot of companies like uh IBM has

807
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,640
kis kit kis kit metal uh other company

808
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,200
um other groups have thing tools like SC

809
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,079
cubits um I think this is very important

810
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,920
for increasing the accessibility of

811
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,040
quantum and allowing rapid Innovation um

812
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,200
in that in that field so one of our

813
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,680
contributions to this was developing an

814
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,359
open- Source um uh harmonic balance

815
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,280
Simulator for uh parametric processes

816
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:04,480
and superc conducting circuits which is

817
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,880
10,000 times faster than the uh

818
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,319
typically used open source software uh

819
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,599
it's used by MIT Google NIS reik and

820
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:13,839
others and we also you know I'm not

821
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,720
against commercial Eda vendors by any

822
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:19,720
means we collaborate with um uh with

823
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,400
kyite to uh improve their Eda tools and

824
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:25,359
and compare them and and really build a

825
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,079
powerful uh uh ecosystem for um

826
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:31,480
simulating Quantum systems

827
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,280
um so with that I want to um acknowledge

828
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,920
my my research group acknowledge the

829
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,640
funders and also um you know thank the

830
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,800
audience and and hopefully have time for

831
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,800
a couple questions thank

832
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,160
you so a few questions for

833
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,319
Kevin no questions okay that's thank Uh

834
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:55,520
Kevin

835
00:37:53,319 --> 00:38:00,160
again thank

836
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,520
you our next speaker is Chima hi

837
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,440
everyone thanks for having me so my

838
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,119
group works on F electric

839
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,400
micronics where we try to re reimagine

840
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,640
or redesign integrated circuit building

841
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,240
blocks towards more energy efficient and

842
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,599
energy autonomous microelectronics so by

843
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,079
integrated circuit building blocks we

844
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,920
mean things like transistors capacitors

845
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,480
diodes things of that nature so the

846
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,680
motivation behind my group's work is

847
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,319
trying to address Energy Grand

848
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,400
challenges but from a microelectronics

849
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:27,760
perspective so one way we could think

850
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,079
about that is looking at the energ

851
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,720
demands from Computing over the years

852
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,280
and we see that Computing right now is

853
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,720
somewhere between 5 and 10% of the

854
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,599
global energy or electricity demand but

855
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,040
the concerning trend is is Computing is

856
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,359
exponentially Rising while our worldwide

857
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,160
energy production is only linearly

858
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,599
increasing so we'll obviously come at an

859
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,599
impass pretty soon which calls for the

860
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,599
need for new paradigms of

861
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,920
computing and the way we typically think

862
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,440
about that is mors law as we make

863
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,880
transistors smaller and smaller we make

864
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,920
them more energy efficient and now we

865
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,800
could have more energy efficient

866
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,240
Computing but there's a certain limit to

867
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,200
how much device miniaturization we could

868
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,480
do so

869
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,440
here we're going to I'm going to show a

870
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,880
brief result later on on how F electrics

871
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,960
could be inserted into the transistor

872
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,079
and have us have help us have a lot more

873
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,359
energy efficient transistor

874
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:11,079
operation and this is towards a broader

875
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,200
goal of getting an adual switch or just

876
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:16,599
as low power switch as possible another

877
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,960
aspect of where this concerning trend of

878
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:19,880
exponential rise in energy consumption

879
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,240
from microelectronics comes from is

880
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,640
actually from the fact that our

881
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:28,160
Computing demand from AI has been

882
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,480
outpacing our increase in in normal

883
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,040
transistor Energy Efficiency operation

884
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,640
so if we're requiring a lot more

885
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,240
Computing than our Energy Efficiency is

886
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,839
rising uh that's where this kind of

887
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,319
increased energy consumption comes from

888
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,880
so we're ALS we're also going to want to

889
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:44,240
kind of develop new forms of AI Hardware

890
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,240
which is nicely summarized by these

891
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,319
papers here AI Hardware has this energy

892
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,240
problem because we're trying to use

893
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:51,560
classical transistors so can we

894
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,079
design new analog neural network

895
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,400
Hardware or other types of designs that

896
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,560
allow us to compute better for these

897
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,640
neural networks

898
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,480
and another maybe underrepresented

899
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,880
aspect of where this energy demand comes

900
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,200
from is the fact that we have all these

901
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,640
Internet of Things devices between

902
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,760
smartphones smart watches Etc and we're

903
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,560
eventually going to want them all to be

904
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,880
self-powered if possible so that means

905
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,920
we're going to need to have sensing

906
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,839
energy storage energy harvesting all

907
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,640
integrated on chip and the way we

908
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:18,079
typically people think about energy

909
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,400
storage on chip is micro super

910
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,119
capacitors or micro batteries but those

911
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,119
have a lot of integration challenges and

912
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,079
it turns out that we could have

913
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,040
electrostatic capacitors that actually

914
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:29,000
could compete with lithium ion micro

915
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,920
batteries iies and other commercial

916
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,400
Technologies so all of these examples

917
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,440
are go into how F electrics could help

918
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,960
um improve the performance of those

919
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,040
incumbent Technologies so first I just

920
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,880
wanted to show like kind of the big

921
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,079
vision of our group which on the left

922
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,760
I'm just highlighting all of the

923
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,839
different ways in which faral electrics

924
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,359
could be integrated into different

925
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:49,839
devices and give you more energy

926
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:51,480
efficient operation so I'll show one

927
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,720
example of for logic we could integrate

928
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,599
the fact that we could scale down F

929
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,400
electrics to the atomic scale thickness

930
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,359
and induce a effect known as a negative

931
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,119
capacitance effect again really energy

932
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:01,680
efficient transistor operation we'll be

933
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:04,280
showing some results on how we could

934
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,240
build a really highly scalable analog AI

935
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,280
Hardware based on F electrics by

936
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,200
leveraging their intrinsic diode effect

937
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,640
and um as Professor Kim mentioned

938
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,079
there's a lot of other exciting

939
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,319
opportunities for integrating fer

940
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,520
electrics with logic and having these

941
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,560
stacked high band withd memories or

942
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,480
compute near memory rather than Compu in

943
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,240
memory and then on the other side of the

944
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,839
coin we have all of these different

945
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,880
Energy Technologies or quote unquote

946
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:29,920
more than

947
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,800
paradigms we could leverage with ferric

948
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,480
so again ferric is a really really

949
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,079
versatile phenomena I'm not getting into

950
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,599
the specifics but basically in a ferric

951
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:38,319
you could apply an electric field and

952
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,960
tune an intrinsic dipole in your unit

953
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,880
cell up and down so it's really

954
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,520
promising for any charge based device so

955
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,560
it could respond to touch for through

956
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,960
the p Electric effect it could respond

957
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,040
to temperature through the py electric

958
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,319
effect it could convert waste heat into

959
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,280
energy which then could cool down your

960
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:54,440
ship through the electrocaloric effect

961
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,839
and it could even respond to light

962
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:59,040
through the bulk fot of the take effect

963
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,480
intrinsic to fer Electrics so again fire

964
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,880
electric is such a versatile phenomenon

965
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,359
and it gives you there's probably no

966
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,359
other material system that I could think

967
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,960
of that can enable all of these

968
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:09,640
different Technologies from the same

969
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,960
material class or material system so

970
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,839
because of that and another key aspect

971
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,160
of what we do is we integrate everything

972
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,000
with low temperature Atomic layer

973
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,280
deposition so Professor Kim was just

974
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,640
mentioning how important it is that

975
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,160
everything we do if we want to be

976
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,960
relevant for microelectronics and 3D

977
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,680
integration we need to be working at low

978
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,640
temperatures at the wafer scale and also

979
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,680
the nice aspect of Atomic layer

980
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:32,319
deposition is 3D conformal so now you

981
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,000
could imagine filling 3D shapes or gate

982
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,480
allaround transistors

983
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,440
Etc and that's again inspired by

984
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,960
Professor Kim's Vision of 3D uh

985
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,599
monolithic integration we could also

986
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,960
Imagine a future where a lot of these

987
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,400
different aspects are improved with fer

988
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,800
electric so it's very complimentary to

989
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,280
all the work done in the semiconductor

990
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,640
space we're just engineering the

991
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,880
dialectric which could then fit in with

992
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,079
whatever backend of the line

993
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,040
semiconductor that's being developed

994
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:57,160
whether it be 2D materials or oxides or

995
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,960
Gan we can inte integrate these f

996
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,319
electrics for either you know high

997
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,319
frequency performance memory logic AI

998
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:05,359
Hardware even these Energy

999
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:07,680
Technologies so the key aspect of our

1000
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:10,319
group we're we're really specializing or

1001
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,359
focusing on Al halfs of chum monoxide

1002
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,559
fire electric in films why is that

1003
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:15,359
because that's the dialectric already

1004
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,520
used in today's logic transistors and

1005
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,000
Dam capacitors so nothing has to change

1006
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,720
from a Foundry process so this is what

1007
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,520
allows us to whatever research result we

1008
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,240
achieve we could quickly translate it to

1009
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,319
either MIT Lincoln Laboratories or a

1010
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:31,119
Foundry and um see the you know high

1011
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,720
volume manufacturing

1012
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,079
benefits

1013
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,079
so for today's talk I'm just going to

1014
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:39,440
briefly briefly introduce um how we

1015
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,960
could replace the conventional

1016
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,960
dialectric using all of these integrated

1017
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,880
circuit building blocks with a fer

1018
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,359
electric and show how you get improved

1019
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,800
performance so I'll first start off with

1020
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:49,400
the transistor where we replace the

1021
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,599
conventional High K dialectric apum

1022
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:53,480
oxide with a quote unquote negative K or

1023
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:55,480
negative permitivity ferroelectric and

1024
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,440
see ultra low power logic transistor

1025
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,440
operation then I'll briefly touch on a

1026
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,280
recent result where we go from the

1027
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,839
classic again whenever when anyone

1028
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,040
thinks about energy storage they usually

1029
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:05,839
thinking about electrochemistry in the

1030
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,280
form of micro batteries or super

1031
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,000
capacitors can we go from

1032
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,880
electrochemical to electrostatic

1033
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,359
paradigms for energy storage and not

1034
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,839
only have ultra high energy density but

1035
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,079
have ultra high power density because

1036
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:17,800
electrostatic capacitors could be

1037
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:20,480
charged and discharged much

1038
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,079
faster in terms of the memorist I'll be

1039
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,599
showing that the conventional technology

1040
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:25,559
that's used in rram and a lot of two

1041
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,319
terminal devices today are based on are

1042
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:30,000
based on defective switch or defective

1043
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,240
filamentary formation can we instead

1044
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,880
have a collective phenomena inherent to

1045
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,319
your unit cell that won't have the same

1046
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:38,160
variability issues as R and then the

1047
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:40,640
last result is a recent results from our

1048
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,440
group where we could see we have really

1049
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,240
high not just onoff ratio but also

1050
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:47,200
rectification and rectification is an

1051
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,200
often underreported aspect of developing

1052
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,800
these non-volatile memories for computer

1053
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:53,000
memory arrays and that allows us to have

1054
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,079
the most array scalable AI Hardware so

1055
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,720
in each of these cases you could think

1056
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,240
of we're we're transforming from an old

1057
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,839
Paradigm and we're just making a very

1058
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,079
very minor change to get a new one we're

1059
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:02,520
either going from high K dialectric to

1060
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,720
Nega k f electrics from Collective from

1061
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,559
defective to Collective switching

1062
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,319
phenomena but again it's all in the same

1063
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:08,720
material this was already half monoxide

1064
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:10,319
based this was already half new monoxide

1065
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,200
based

1066
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:14,079
Etc so I'll first start off with the

1067
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,280
transistor example um just in the

1068
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,319
interest of time I won't really explain

1069
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,400
the kind of materials and physics behind

1070
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:22,400
it but just know that it is actually

1071
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,440
possible to put one material on top of

1072
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,000
another so typically on top of S2 we

1073
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,880
always have this native oxide on top of

1074
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,359
silicon we also have this native S2

1075
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,640
which depending on your process is

1076
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,240
around 8 ANM thickness we can actually

1077
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,240
add our halfs or corium oxide material

1078
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,839
on top of it and have larger capacitance

1079
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,200
than we started with so this is what we

1080
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:41,960
refer to as a negative capacitance

1081
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,200
effect and because of this we're not

1082
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,680
changing the physical thickness than

1083
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,760
what's in today's Capac in today's

1084
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,800
transistor gate stack so we see no

1085
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,000
Mobility leakage or reliability

1086
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,319
degradation compared to what the

1087
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,480
incumbent technology is while getting

1088
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,240
all the benefits of having higher

1089
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,440
capacitance which namely is you're

1090
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,640
allowed to operate your transistor at

1091
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,599
lower lower

1092
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:02,400
power so here's just comparing our haum

1093
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,599
zonum oxide based gate stack compared to

1094
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,040
Conventional technology today um and you

1095
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,160
can see that our leakage is the same

1096
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,680
because we're not changing the physical

1097
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,800
thickness so we have the same tunneling

1098
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,559
and because of that we're able to

1099
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,000
achieve this the same leakage current

1100
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:15,920
but at much lower eot and the same

1101
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,040
Mobility at much lower eot without

1102
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,720
having the typical transport

1103
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,040
degradations that others see when they

1104
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,480
try to thin down their

1105
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,559
S2 um we've integrated this into MIT

1106
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,559
Lincoln laboratory because again we're

1107
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:26,800
using the same materials the same atomic

1108
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:29,000
layer deposition technique that's used

1109
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,760
to today so even though Lincoln MIT

1110
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,160
Lincoln lab goes down to 90 NM gate

1111
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,880
length transistors we're able to match

1112
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,599
the transconductance scene in much more

1113
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,599
advanced transistor Technologies so

1114
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:38,880
we're actually going to be working with

1115
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,480
these foundaries now to integrate our

1116
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,040
material into these more advanced gate

1117
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,119
lengths to actually see these record

1118
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,400
setting trans conductance values so

1119
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:46,520
again this is all derived from the fact

1120
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,760
that we're getting this capacitance

1121
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,319
boost without having any transport

1122
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,520
degradation so our carrier velocity is

1123
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:55,000
not degraded so GM is a nice metric for

1124
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,559
us to look at we also could compare the

1125
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,839
I on ey off Behavior again at very very

1126
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:00,880
more you know Legacy nodes compared to

1127
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,240
the more advanced nodes these aren't

1128
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,040
even the advanced nodes but just as a

1129
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,720
comparison we're getting a multiple node

1130
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:08,240
technology boost integrating our gate di

1131
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:11,240
electric material compared to tsmc IBM

1132
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,680
and other foundaries so this again shows

1133
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,079
and again these Lincoln laboratory

1134
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,760
transistors don't even have the strain

1135
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,160
silicon or rour strain or the other

1136
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,160
bells and whistles that give you

1137
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,599
improved eye on eye off performance but

1138
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,000
just from purely the gate stack changing

1139
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:24,319
it from this high K to negative K

1140
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,480
dialectric we get all these performance

1141
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,880
benefits and in terms of the impact we

1142
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,720
made in foundaries like I mentioned

1143
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,839
we've been integrated into MIT Lincoln

1144
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,760
Laboratories prototyping Foundry Samsung

1145
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:35,760
Electronics integrated this exact same

1146
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,839
Gat stack into their finfet process and

1147
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,000
show that they're getting the limit of

1148
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:41,200
60 MTS per decade subdural swing um and

1149
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,559
we've been highlighted in a recent

1150
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,839
review from Intel on the uh 75th

1151
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:47,040
anniversary of the transistor as this is

1152
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:48,680
the future for uh more energy efficient

1153
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,720
transistor performance and we'll be

1154
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,240
working with more foundaries to

1155
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,160
integrate these into more advanced

1156
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,680
transistor geometries so the nice thing

1157
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,880
about this skate dialectric is it's very

1158
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,880
flexible platform in the sense that no

1159
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,200
matter where technology goes in the

1160
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,640
future where whether we have planer

1161
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,520
transistors finfets Nano sheets stack

1162
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,040
Nanos sheets or we go from Silicon to 2D

1163
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,280
every transistor will need a dialectric

1164
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,160
so we could still use this negative

1165
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,119
capacitance effect to increase the

1166
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:14,359
capacitance and have lower power

1167
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:16,640
operation and then just a quick quick

1168
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:18,319
result on the capacitor I'll just all I

1169
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,680
want to say is that we did a lot of

1170
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,240
material science engineering to increase

1171
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,680
um the performance of these capacitors

1172
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,760
the main thing we overcame like in the

1173
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,599
last case we overcame the leakage eot

1174
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,280
tradeoff and dialectric materials here

1175
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,200
we overcame the fact that primitivity

1176
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,160
and breakdown strength tend to fall on

1177
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,520
this uh empirical line where your

1178
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,000
breakdown strength is proportional to

1179
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,720
the permitivity to the minus one half

1180
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,760
power but if you think of the energy

1181
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:41,839
storage as 1 half CV squar pretty much

1182
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,319
all di electrics will cancel out but if

1183
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,720
we could actually boost the permitivity

1184
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:46,520
or the capacitance of our materials

1185
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,800
without sacrificing the breakdown we

1186
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,680
could actually have breakthrough energy

1187
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,599
storage performance and it turns out we

1188
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,880
do we actually have you know orders of

1189
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,079
magnitude higher energy storage and

1190
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,000
power density than any other

1191
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,359
electrostatic Paradigm and we're 100

1192
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,400
million times faster than a commercial

1193
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:01,760
lithium microbattery while just being

1194
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,960
one order of magnitude away in energy

1195
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,359
density so we're starting to close the

1196
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,599
gap on a commercial lithium microbattery

1197
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,720
so now you can imagine a phone that

1198
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:11,240
charges in a microsecond or a nanc the

1199
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,119
only issue is it'll you'll have to

1200
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,119
recharge it a little more often than a

1201
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:16,680
commercial lithium ion so we're still

1202
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,520
looking at how to close this Gap and how

1203
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:20,880
to scale up so with that I'll I'll stop

1204
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,000
right here but I just wanted to mention

1205
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,280
that again we could reimagine all these

1206
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,599
different integrated circuit Elements by

1207
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,119
replacing the dialectric with the fer

1208
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:31,400
electric um um there's a result on a mem

1209
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,839
we have a result on the F electric diode

1210
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:35,000
um that also gives kind of breakthrough

1211
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:37,440
results in terms of rectifying ratio and

1212
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,359
array scalability for computer memory

1213
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,920
arrays and um with that I'll stop here

1214
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,680
it just allows us now to really build

1215
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,559
this 3D integrated Ship by integrating

1216
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,280
our fer electrics with different

1217
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:48,839
semiconductors by working with all the

1218
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,400
great groups on campus here at MIT

1219
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:52,319
working on semiconductors and we could

1220
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,520
achieve all these different

1221
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:57,520
functionalities with fer electrics

1222
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,520
thanks

1223
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:06,400
thank you for sharing all the exciting

1224
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,400
results um do we have any question for

1225
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:14,520
S okay if you have any question please

1226
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:19,960
talk to him thank you uh our last

1227
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:19,960
speaker of this session is uh Joel

1228
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:27,240
kaso do you have a slide thank you

1229
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,280
okay hi everyone so I'm very happy to be

1230
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,960
here today to talk to you about what we

1231
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,359
think are some of the needed Innovations

1232
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,240
for material syntheses and devices in

1233
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:45,440
the case of nitride semiconductors and

1234
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,960
all the Technologies we think we can

1235
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,079
impact so as we know in Innovation

1236
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,559
continues we know that today a lot of

1237
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,359
the uh transitions deviate just from

1238
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,960
lateral scaling in Mo's law and as we

1239
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:58,760
look towards actually chiplet

1240
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,240
diversification and 3dh I think this

1241
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,240
actually is a really good opportunity

1242
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,079
for new materials integration where you

1243
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,160
where you can now not have to consider

1244
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,280
well I have to invent my new materials

1245
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,359
on the latest node we can design each

1246
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:11,960
node based on a certain functionality so

1247
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:13,960
hopefully this is what I think could be

1248
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,960
a self-fulfilling prophecy so I always

1249
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,720
viewed that new materials can lead to

1250
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,760
new circuits so hopefully this is a time

1251
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,040
where we can actually be complimentary

1252
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,599
in materials

1253
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,319
design one of so the general tricks we

1254
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:27,760
have our at our disposal from a direct

1255
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:29,920
growth both perspectives some of them

1256
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,440
are outlined here right so the case a is

1257
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,880
kind of home up a taxi where everything

1258
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,119
works out well you have the same last

1259
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,000
parameter that usually doesn't happen

1260
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,559
case b is when the atoms are strained a

1261
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,599
little bit but the interface is still

1262
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:43,359
pristine this is usually what happens a

1263
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:44,640
lot Case C is an exaggerated case where

1264
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,520
you know you don't have the right

1265
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,079
crystal or lattice Arrangement so you

1266
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,880
break bonds at these interface and

1267
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,520
you'll form the threading defects so

1268
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,559
from a sythesis perspective we always

1269
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,319
want to try to either eliminate this

1270
00:51:53,559 --> 00:51:57,240
case or basically constrain the

1271
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:59,040
thickness the other one is

1272
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,000
an area that Professor Kim mentioned

1273
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,200
where you can use a mask and and lateral

1274
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,079
laterally overgrow from a selected area

1275
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,920
so we're hoping from a new materials

1276
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:09,480
perspective what we need to do is be

1277
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:11,319
able to suppress these dislocations and

1278
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,319
be able to grow thicknesses let's say 2

1279
00:52:11,319 --> 00:52:16,000
nanometers to two microns be able to

1280
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:17,280
control buffer layer thicknesses and

1281
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,079
also be able to do this in ways where

1282
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,920
you can control doping at low

1283
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:24,760
temperatures which is generally hard to

1284
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:27,280
do with in the nitride semiconductor

1285
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,640
ecosystem so if we can if we can solve

1286
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,079
this there's a lot of Technologies you

1287
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,960
think we can impact and here here are

1288
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:34,240
some examples that that I'll describe

1289
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:36,119
where we're talking about Gan devices so

1290
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,119
Gans a wonderful material as everybody

1291
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:40,200
knows where you have applications

1292
00:52:38,119 --> 00:52:43,040
ranging from 10 kilovolts down to 10

1293
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:45,839
volts as you look at 3dh and different

1294
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,960
system designs right uh on on chip

1295
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:49,280
voltage voltage regulation heat

1296
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,359
management right High thermal

1297
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,960
conductivity of Gan is important a lot

1298
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,760
of the limitations we have are by

1299
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,799
conventional epitaxy techniques like

1300
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,000
mocvd you're going to form a lot of

1301
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:01,160
threading dislocations at this interface

1302
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,240
and that sets a thickness limit for your

1303
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,920
buffer layer that you before the actual

1304
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,799
Crystal will crack and relieve stress

1305
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,359
these dislocations are also a source of

1306
00:53:07,799 --> 00:53:11,920
leakage current in your in your high

1307
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,319
voltage diodes this is also an example

1308
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:15,920
of work that's come out of Intel where

1309
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:19,880
they're using layer transfer to again

1310
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:21,839
grow Gan at 900 C or above by mocvd and

1311
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,680
so that that changes their integration

1312
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:26,079
schemes so it' be great if we could have

1313
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,640
the same epot taxi material deposited a

1314
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:30,720
400

1315
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:32,440
C okay one one aspect we're really

1316
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,480
exciting and things I worked on during

1317
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:37,040
my PhD as well was sort of the the front

1318
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,440
end modules right so this is Gan for Gan

1319
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,359
based hemps for the high power let's say

1320
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,920
w band 94 GHz and higher frequencies

1321
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:45,480
right so this is your monolithic

1322
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,680
microwave integrated circuit for the

1323
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:49,880
base station applications where these

1324
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,640
new materials and this is the case of

1325
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,440
sorry this is the case of aluminum

1326
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:55,839
Scandium nitride where we're adding

1327
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,000
alloing Scandium to aln you have a

1328
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,640
really new design space of band Gap and

1329
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,559
lattice parameter it's really important

1330
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,079
for photonics that you haven't had in

1331
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:05,480
the traditional nitride family because

1332
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:07,680
of the difference now you have new

1333
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,480
material properties you have a change in

1334
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,359
spontaneous and pzo electric

1335
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,799
polarization you're actually changing

1336
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:16,040
the charge density in your channel right

1337
00:54:13,799 --> 00:54:18,000
so this is a new way to engineer devices

1338
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,799
compared to the commercial aluminum

1339
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,440
Gallum nitride barrier layers that are

1340
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:25,720
used in lateral devices and the biggest

1341
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,960
thing that this buys you other than in

1342
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,720
potentially inreased reliability from

1343
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:32,160
from strain engineering is the fact that

1344
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:33,760
you can overcome potential limits which

1345
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,480
has been hypothesized in this paper is

1346
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,160
that you can overcome the Bode Fano

1347
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,040
limit because you can use this higher

1348
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:41,520
current density you can draw your load

1349
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:42,960
line differently and so it's projected

1350
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:45,079
that we're not even near the material

1351
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,200
limits yet and that using new materials

1352
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:49,640
like aluminum Scandium nitride in the

1353
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:51,760
existing metal polar device geometries

1354
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,400
can actually even outperform all the

1355
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:57,880
great work that's being done on the N

1356
00:54:53,400 --> 00:55:00,000
poar hemp at 94 GHz currently

1357
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,280
the other is thinking about just new

1358
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,799
device designed right so we have new

1359
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,359
materials that we're working on in our

1360
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,920
group in addition to actually new

1361
00:55:04,359 --> 00:55:08,400
functionalities enabled by the new

1362
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:10,520
properties so building on what Professor

1363
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,559
Chima said before is that we have now

1364
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:14,160
Fair electricity and also the nitrides

1365
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,400
that's a relatively new phenomenon in

1366
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,520
nitride semiconductors so what we can

1367
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,799
see here is Guided by simulation this is

1368
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,440
where you forming your electron Channel

1369
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:24,119
you can utilize this new material so

1370
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,319
this is aluminum scum nitrite in the

1371
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:28,200
barrier layer of the lateral hemp you

1372
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,079
you're getting up to 3.5 amps per

1373
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,119
millimeter 4 amps per millim on current

1374
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:34,280
densities and these devices are are are

1375
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:36,520
not passivated either so there's a lot

1376
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,960
of room for improvement as well and with

1377
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,640
these new material properties you start

1378
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:41,920
seeing some memory Windows some

1379
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:44,319
threshold voltage tunability uh you

1380
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,640
actually you're also seeing sub 60 molt

1381
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:48,079
per decade sub threshold slopes at room

1382
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,880
temperature so we believe there's a lot

1383
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,039
of nice opportunities in the ferel

1384
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:54,000
electric ecosystem here where you can

1385
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:55,720
really just rethink electrostatics

1386
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,880
generally right and actually maybe even

1387
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,640
ways that can combat short Channel

1388
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:01,240
effects that are known in nitride

1389
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:04,680
semiconductors where you get the

1390
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:06,440
electron uh saturation velocity rollof

1391
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,400
we also think that utilizing these new

1392
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,520
materials is a way to actually have

1393
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,079
improve your gain at high frequency

1394
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,039
Beyond just the uh device scaling and

1395
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:16,599
the tricks that we play to enhance trans

1396
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,000
conductance so we're really excited

1397
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:20,680
about this new type of device we coined

1398
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,039
the the Ferro

1399
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:24,280
hemp the other area that I'm really

1400
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,400
excited about is actually the new

1401
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,319
materials new deposition schemes for

1402
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,599
silicon photonics right we know there's

1403
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:32,440
a there's a big demand for high-speed

1404
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:35,160
data transmission right so whether it's

1405
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,160
Optical interconnects wave guides so the

1406
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:39,200
current state-ofthe-art is thin foam

1407
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:41,599
lithium Nate and while there's been a

1408
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,760
lot of revolutionary advances in the

1409
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,000
technology over time lithium nabate

1410
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,960
itself is not without its challenges

1411
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,359
right it's generally an ion implantation

1412
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:52,200
a smart cut process which Li which

1413
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:54,359
limits your thickness and your

1414
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:56,760
wavelength range right it's not easy to

1415
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:58,960
integrate on Silicon directly so we have

1416
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,520
materials like aluminum Scandium nitride

1417
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,480
where they they have even higher band

1418
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,720
Gap than lithium nabate and we can grow

1419
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:06,119
them directly on Silicon so we believe

1420
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,599
that this is really a platform that

1421
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:10,559
could revelage nonlinear Optics right

1422
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:12,720
these are some measurements here that

1423
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:15,280
were done by collaboration of far and

1424
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,599
R's group at Cornell that's showing you

1425
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,359
can get really large enhancement in the

1426
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:21,319
nonlinear Optical coefficient compared

1427
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,960
to aluminum nitrite so other groups are

1428
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:25,079
seeing this we think this is a big

1429
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,839
opportunity this is a very uh exciting

1430
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:29,520
area right now

1431
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:31,240
the other the other aspect to at the

1432
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,480
other end of the RF front modules right

1433
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,760
so the Acoustics and integration on RFS

1434
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:38,079
SOI is looking at new materials for the

1435
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,640
space what was maybe not as known at the

1436
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,319
time was a lot of a lot of the

1437
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,720
Innovations Came From A Material Science

1438
00:57:41,319 --> 00:57:45,200
perspective people were looking for

1439
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:47,079
elements to increase the bandwidth right

1440
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,880
by increasing this is your material

1441
00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:51,319
figure Merit roughly ignoring the

1442
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,119
quality Factor right this is KT s so it

1443
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:55,079
gives you larger bandwidth and more and

1444
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:57,160
better outof band rejection in your

1445
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:59,680
resonator so people showed is you had a

1446
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:01,720
large increase in the Paso Electric

1447
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,079
coefficient boost which was interesting

1448
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:05,119
because one of the plots that we made

1449
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:06,720
was to try to show well fundamentally

1450
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,720
what materials do you need right you

1451
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,079
want a more compliant bond which is more

1452
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,200
pzo electric but that also hurts your

1453
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:15,559
stiffness right for a resonator you want

1454
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,720
it to be very stiff analogy someone gave

1455
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:19,160
me is that you're stretching a tarp over

1456
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,400
the length of the football field and

1457
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,880
that cannot bend more than a millimeter

1458
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,160
was was that was the analogy someone

1459
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,960
gave me so we believe if you think

1460
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,520
aluminum scum nit was great for

1461
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,440
resonators which it is it's already

1462
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,839
commercialized we have ideas for new

1463
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:34,200
nitrides that are going to do even

1464
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:36,480
better than aluminum scanning

1465
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,799
nitride so how so how are we going to do

1466
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,640
this and the answer sounds uh simple in

1467
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:42,119
pract simple in practice but it's hard

1468
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:44,000
sorry simple in theory but it's hard in

1469
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:46,920
practice is actually utilizing the

1470
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,640
periodic table so nitrides revolutionary

1471
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,400
progress in the last 30 years but we

1472
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,480
believe there's a lot of legs left by

1473
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,480
expanding the elements that we have at

1474
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,760
our disposal right for the last 30 years

1475
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,160
we're mostly here as we expand into new

1476
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,599
elements and even new Crystal

1477
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,839
chemistries we believe this is going to

1478
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,839
be very fertile ground for the

1479
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:05,119
combination of Material Science and Rich

1480
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:07,599
physics where we can integrate new

1481
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,559
materials even such as nitride perides

1482
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,799
and we can make the nitrides look like

1483
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:14,160
oxides in a

1484
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:15,680
way so these are these are just some

1485
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,359
examples showing about how we're going

1486
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,280
about this or how we how we going about

1487
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:21,200
the epaxial growth at low temperatures

1488
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,079
with these new chemistries so this is an

1489
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:26,119
example of a project IED where we're

1490
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:28,000
actually using magnetron sputter epitaxy

1491
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:29,680
to grow aluminum boron nitride this is a

1492
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,319
semiconductor material with a greater

1493
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:35,039
than 5.5 EV band Gap and we did this at

1494
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:37,440
only 300C so you getting Crystal quality

1495
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,799
comparable ToBD at much lower

1496
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,720
temperatures and we can overcome the

1497
00:59:39,799 --> 00:59:43,480
traditional limits associated with

1498
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,920
growth for nitride semiconductors where

1499
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:48,200
we can get breakdown voltages in excess

1500
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,240
of 8 megga volts per centimeter and

1501
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,520
pristine surface morphology right this

1502
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,440
is something that you can't do

1503
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,799
commercially with with Mo cvd on

1504
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:58,520
it another aspect ECT is just thinking

1505
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,720
outside the box for new material

1506
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:03,039
synthesis this is an example where we

1507
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,200
actually used uh ther thermal epitaxy

1508
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:07,440
this is MBE we grew a nitride

1509
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,160
semiconductor with no plasma just

1510
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,319
nitrogen gas this is the first time it's

1511
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:13,000
ever been done we're actually showing

1512
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:15,359
that depending on our synthesis we can

1513
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,599
actually catalyze nitrogen Bond so a lot

1514
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:18,039
of new opportunities here to think

1515
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:20,839
outside the box and how do we just

1516
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:22,440
engineer micr structure in new compounds

1517
01:00:20,839 --> 01:00:26,079
so we're so we're really excited about

1518
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,640
the about the possibilities here

1519
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:30,359
the other is actually looking forward

1520
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:33,119
into Al there old saying if if it can be

1521
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:35,000
done by Al it will be done by Al so

1522
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,480
we're actually looking at um can we

1523
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,240
actually change the form factor for

1524
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:41,039
nitride devices right can we put these

1525
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,520
polarization induced channels anywhere

1526
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:44,359
right and then can you for acoustic

1527
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,880
devices can you integrate multiple

1528
01:00:44,359 --> 01:00:48,799
frequency bands on the same chip so this

1529
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,880
is an example of work that we've done in

1530
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:55,680
MIT Nano where this is truly cais

1531
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:57,599
oriented Gan grown at only 250° C and

1532
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,520
this case this was on Sapphire so we

1533
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,119
believe that this is actually a

1534
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,480
promising First Step again for lower

1535
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,880
temperature

1536
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,640
deposition so the one thing I wanted to

1537
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,319
say and I'll leave you with is I believe

1538
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,000
that the future involves answering the

1539
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:13,440
hard problems of how do we change our

1540
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:15,400
thinking and our thought process of

1541
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,240
direct growth and I think a lot of this

1542
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,280
comes down to how do we better

1543
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:21,480
understand the plasma physics like this

1544
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,920
is an example of magnetron sputtering

1545
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,480
you're looking at the recombination

1546
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,760
event in the plasma there and so can we

1547
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,599
look to the the past to enable future

1548
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,000
Innovations this plot on the right

1549
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,720
there's a lot's a lot of information

1550
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,039
this is a sputter Zone diagram that was

1551
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:37,640
developed for Metals this first plot was

1552
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:39,039
made about 55 years ago and actually

1553
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,000
understanding this plot led to some of

1554
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:43,280
the Innovations in for the passive

1555
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,960
components in integrated circuits and in

1556
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,680
summary what this plot on the right is

1557
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,640
showing you is that there's multiple

1558
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:51,000
ways to reconsider effective temperature

1559
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:53,359
when you're doing your deposition right

1560
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:55,119
so we think of temperature as the only

1561
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:57,599
means to increase surface add and

1562
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,799
Mobility in header structure what I'm

1563
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,839
what I'm saying what the community is

1564
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:01,760
starting to realize is that there are

1565
01:01:59,839 --> 01:02:04,039
other ways as well to consider as a

1566
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,200
different knob so if we can utilize this

1567
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:08,799
to devel to develop new electronic grade

1568
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:10,200
materials at low temperatures we we will

1569
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:12,359
have we will have the new performance

1570
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:15,520
devices in the circuits of the future

1571
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:15,520
thank you
