00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,120
Hello everyone, my name is Somaya and

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,920
welcome to a case study of using the

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,639
genomics to proteins portal, a resource

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,440
and discovery platform for investigating

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,920
genetic screening outputs to protein

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,320
sequence and structure.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,800
Before starting the case study, a few

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,960
info that might be helpful. If the

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,359
portal is useful for your research,

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,920
please site our publication.

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,239
We have a series of tutorials that are

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,719
posted in the G2P portal's YouTube

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,040
channel. If you don't want to miss a new

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,719
case study, then please go ahead and

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,280
subscribe.

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,680
Finally, do you have feedback for us?

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,320
Want to partner with us for a specific

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,280
analysis or collaboration? Then reach

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,320
out to us via the feedback form on the

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,879
homepage of the portal. So with that

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,840
let's start today's case study which

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,399
will focus on analyzing the protein or

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,080
molecular level effect of a clinically

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,720
identified variant in KIF2A

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,799
with significance level listed as

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,439
uncertain significance in cleanvar

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,080
database which means that with the

28
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,479
current set of evidence the variant

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,320
cannot be classified as benign or

30
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,640
pathogenic

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,280
but what's the effect of this mutation

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,920
on protein. That's what we will try to

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,720
answer in this use case. A little

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,119
spoiler, we will also see that this

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,400
particular variant is annotated on a

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,119
non-anonical transcript and we will see

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,159
how you can use the genomics to proteins

38
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,600
portal to analyze the protein effect of

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:47,680
a non-anonical transcript variant by

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,280
mapping it onto the canonical protein.

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,520
All right. So let's go to the portal and

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,759
we will use resource module for this

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,680
case study.

44
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:03,600
And now we will type the gene name to

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,920
load the gene page. And here the first

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,239
tab that is open is the protein sequence

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,440
annotation with the protein feature

48
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,879
viewer where you have a suite of protein

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,599
sequence structural and interaction and

50
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,720
also functional features that you can

51
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,720
display at the amino acid level

52
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,400
and then we will go to variant to

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,560
protein sequence tab to find the target

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,640
variant of interest for this particular

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,120
tutorial.

56
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,360
So after you load this tab you will see

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,519
that by default we have a protein

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,800
isoform selected which is a

59
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,200
non-cononical protein isoform. So we

60
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,239
will first select the canonical protein

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,120
isoform uniro database which is marked

62
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,239
with this asteric here

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,360
and then we will scroll down to identify

64
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,840
cleanvar variant. However, the portal

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,120
will display now that all clean bar

66
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,720
variant for this particular gene

67
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,040
are annotated on a different transcript

68
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,599
which is not the transcript that is

69
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,640
associated with the canonical protein

70
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,200
isoform. So we will use this particular

71
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,519
feature offered by the portal and we

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,800
will align variant from another

73
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,640
transcript. So we'll click here and we

74
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,680
will identify this particular transcript

75
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,239
that ends with 18 which is this one.

76
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,840
This is the canonical transcript but not

77
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,360
matched with the canonical protein

78
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,319
isopform.

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,959
So we'll select this one. And now you

80
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,480
will see that clean var variants are

81
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,360
mapped onto the protein sequence. But by

82
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,840
default we show only the pathogenic

83
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,959
variants. But remember this particular

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,040
target variant of interest is um a

85
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,480
variant of uncertain significance. So we

86
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,480
will click here to bring in all the voss

87
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,080
and map them onto the protein. So our um

88
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,400
variant

89
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,680
was this particular uh glycine to um

90
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,920
arginine mutation that is located on to

91
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,799
uh the 478

92
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,479
position of the protein sequence. So we

93
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,359
will zoom in

94
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:23,120
And we will identify that position which

95
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:26,160
is this one. And now on the platform you

96
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,280
can click on this orange sphere to open

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,280
the details of this variant and also the

98
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,160
protein feature of the reference amino

99
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,199
acid

100
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,040
as the card information. So um in this

101
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,280
variant information card you can

102
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,160
identify this particular uh mutation

103
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,040
that we are currently analyzing listed

104
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,840
as a VUS uh along with the phenotype

105
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,000
information. And now let's look at the

106
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,919
protein feature card to understand the

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,520
protein level effect of this particular

108
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,000
mutation glycine to arginine. Uh so at

109
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,320
the amino acid level the uh impact is

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,320
substantial because the glycine and

111
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,520
arginine are two very different amino

112
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,880
acids and also uh uh according to the

113
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,039
structural feature um uh according to

114
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,960
multiple structural features um this

115
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,440
particular mutation is located on a

116
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,479
helical structure uh pretty much in the

117
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,720
core uh of the protein and also has a

118
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,880
very high confidence level per alpha

119
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,960
fold which demonstrate that this

120
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,680
particular mutation will have an effect

121
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,479
on structural features of the protein.

122
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,560
Um and additionally this mutation seems

123
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,400
to a mutation seems to impact the

124
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,320
protein protein interaction as well

125
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,000
according to this experimentally solved

126
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,520
structure 6BN. So it breaks a hydrogen

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,759
bond

128
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,919
um and also um this particular mutation

129
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,880
is located on the protein domain as

130
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,400
well. So because we uh understood now

131
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,120
the protein structure uh that uh have an

132
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,800
effect uh by this mutation on the

133
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,560
interaction site. Let's try to

134
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,520
investigate this protein structure and

135
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,800
find out where exactly this mutation uh

136
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,880
is on the structure. So for that we will

137
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,080
go to the next tab variant to protein

138
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:16,319
structure and we will click on this uh

139
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,800
uh experimental structure 6BN.

140
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,720
So after uh the page loads we will do

141
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,280
the similar exercise to map the

142
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,240
non-cononical variant uh to canonical

143
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,120
protein isoform first. So we'll use the

144
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,120
align uh variant feature and we will

145
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:37,440
bring in this particular transcript and

146
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,560
we will select all the vss to bring our

147
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,479
target variant um onto the protein uh

148
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,840
sequence.

149
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:49,680
So I believe this is the particular um

150
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,520
variant at the position 478. And now

151
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,199
let's look at the structure. So this

152
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,520
color

153
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,800
structure is the structure of the

154
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,800
protein encoded by this gene. Now to see

155
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,880
the mutation on this structure, what we

156
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,400
will do is we will uh click on this row

157
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,440
header on the sequence viewer and that

158
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,080
will map all the mutation as orange

159
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,960
spheres on the structure.

160
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,840
So now when you hover over the mutation

161
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,080
position on the sequence, it will

162
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,639
actually show that where this mutation

163
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,960
is on the structure. Now it highlights

164
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,880
it and it will also display the disease

165
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,319
annotations and protein consequences

166
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,240
from the clean bar. So now with that we

167
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,199
now know that this is the position of

168
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,759
the mutation

169
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,759
this particular sphere. Um now let's

170
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,160
also map a protein feature onto the

171
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,800
structure. So for that we will hit this

172
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,960
domain um and that will highlight the

173
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,240
part of the protein that is that

174
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,400
particular domain. But our target um

175
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,479
variant of interest is this particular

176
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,360
position. Um and by mapping it on the

177
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,919
structure now we can clearly see that

178
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,000
this particular variant is at the

179
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,319
protein protein interface interacting

180
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
with this particular protein and it is

181
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:14,080
on a helical structure um um and it is

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,680
very likely that it will have an impact

183
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,240
on uh protein structure and function. So

184
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,199
I hope this uh tutorial has been useful.

185
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,560
Um come back again for a new tutorial.

186
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,560
Uh thank you.
