1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,199
okay good

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,720
afternoon here we

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,720
are March 19 lecture

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,640
13

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:33,840
we are still in the process of studying

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,840
mixtures the one wonderful word of

7
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:41,200
mixtures and so let me just uh

8
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,199
briefly see where we

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:49,280
are you remember that we discussed

10
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:50,000
um the properties of isobaric mixing

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,399
which

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,399
are uh measurable properties that allow

13
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,559
us to

14
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:05,920
infer uh the chemical potentials

15
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,920
thanks to this uh expression

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,960
here we

17
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,920
[Music]

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,920
discussed the intermolecular forces

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,920
between

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,600
molecules and for example the fact that

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,240
in the gas or ideal gas

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,520
regime

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,720
molecules spend most most of their time

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,200
far away from each other in spite of

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,560
having an enormous amount of collisions

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,560
per

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:49,159
second during which they do get

28
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,080
close but the time they spend close is

29
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,520
small with respect

30
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,000
[Music]

31
00:01:52,520 --> 00:02:01,399
to uh the average and

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,000
so since the properties are determined

33
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:04,000
uh by the

34
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,400
average the effect of when of the

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,959
intermolecular reaction

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,599
interactions uh is

37
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,640
relatively

38
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:24,360
negligible and that's the ideal gas for

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,440
regime we will see more about

40
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,680
that uh

41
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,760
today uh from another point of view

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,760
which which uh we will see in a

43
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:46,239
moment we introduced a first ideal

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:50,120
Behavior Uh model based on this idea of

45
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,120
uh particles not

46
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,599
interacting which is the ideal Gibs

47
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,760
Dalton mixture

48
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,959
model in which as you remember the idea

49
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,319
is that that we uh represent the the

50
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,200
properties of the

51
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,599
mixture as

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,560
equivalent to the properties of a

53
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,239
composite system in

54
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,680
which the various components are

55
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,640
separate they occupy the same volum they

56
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,640
are the same temperature and they are at

57
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,640
the partial

58
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,480
pressure according to this uh model if

59
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,319
we

60
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,319
if each of the substances

61
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:40,200
behaves as an ideal gas so obeys the

62
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:43,799
ideal gas PV equals RT

63
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,840
um equation of

64
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,760
State we found that the partial

65
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:55,680
properties add up to the pressure of the

66
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:58,280
mixture that's D dton law this

67
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,360
here and the partial pressures are given

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,200
by the pressure of the mixture times the

69
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,319
mole

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,760
fraction plus the chemical potential of

71
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,879
the components in the mixture of each

72
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,799
component is equal

73
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:16,440
to this important expression that gives

74
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,479
the that is the sum of the chemical

75
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,519
potential of the pure component at the

76
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,440
same temperature and pressure of the

77
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,440
mixture plus RT the log of a mole

78
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,440
fraction

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,280
we

80
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,840
then um proved also the amagat low

81
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,840
additive

82
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:52,199
volumes uh whereby an ideal gas mixture

83
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:56,120
is such that uh you can also view

84
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,639
it as a composite of separate uh pure

85
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,960
gases

86
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,320
each all at the same temperature

87
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:07,479
pressure but each occupying the

88
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,479
the uh so-called proper

89
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,880
volume which is given but the volume

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,520
that the they would occupy at the uh

91
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:24,479
when pure in the same amount uh at the

92
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,479
same temperature and

93
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,639
pressure then we discussed mixing

94
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,280
spontaneous

95
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,759
mixing what happens when we have

96
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,319
separate

97
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,840
gases kept separate by partitions that

98
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,160
are movable so they are all at the same

99
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,400
temperature and

100
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,080
pressure and without any external effect

101
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,520
you see the weight is at the same level

102
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,479
you just let them mix if you take the

103
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:59,199
partitions away and let them

104
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:00,319
mix we found that the mixing under these

105
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,120
conditions

106
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,080
yields the final temperature and the

107
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,319
final pressure equal to the initial

108
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,840
ones and the

109
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:14,080
entropy increases by the so-called uh

110
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,720
entropy of mixing which is given by this

111
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,560
term

112
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,560
minus the number of particles total

113
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,840
number of particles the gas constant and

114
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,560
the sum

115
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:29,160
of Y log y

116
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,560
so the mole fractions time the logarithm

117
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,560
of the mole

118
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:40,720
fractions we also noticed

119
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:43,240
that we could have done that mixing in a

120
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,319
better way better from the thermodynamic

121
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,800
point of view in other words

122
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:54,520
reversibly in a weight process and we

123
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:57,879
computed how much work we could uh oh so

124
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:03,440
that for how much weight lifting we

125
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:07,039
could get if we did that uh uh indeed

126
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,039
reversibly and here's the

127
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,520
formula and the last thing we discussed

128
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,039
was a

129
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,280
pictorial idea

130
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,400
of how

131
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,360
that extraction of thetic availability

132
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:32,520
could uh could be done if we

133
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:36,759
have uh semi- perable

134
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:41,160
membranes so here we picture first of

135
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:46,000
all the idea is that when we have a a

136
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:47,879
gas um confined in a volume by a

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,120
partition and on the other side of the

138
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,479
partition there is volume I mean there

139
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,360
is

140
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:58,639
vacuum um the pressure of

141
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,840
the molecules here on the Piston will

142
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,759
tend to push it

143
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:08,680
uh uh so as to increase uh the

144
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,280
volume and that will lift the weight if

145
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,520
properly

146
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:17,680
connected similarly the black

147
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:22,680
particles now the idea here is that in

148
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:25,479
ideal G Gibs Dalton mixture Behavior the

149
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,520
particles essentially even in the

150
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:31,680
mixture ignore each other they don't

151
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:34,399
they live in the entire volume even as

152
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,479
if the others weren't

153
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,959
there so for the gray particles to

154
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:46,160
expand to to here whether there is a the

155
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:48,040
black particles or not isn't really

156
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,760
difference

157
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:57,279
so that is the idea that we can

158
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:00,040
achieve with these semi-permeable

159
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,279
membranes this one

160
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,440
allows the black particles to go through

161
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:08,720
but not the gray so the gray will push

162
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,720
it to the right and pull up this weight

163
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,279
this other membrane is

164
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,440
permeable to the gray particles but not

165
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:20,640
the black so the black will push it

166
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,640
leftward and pull up this other

167
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,200
way

168
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,600
okay you asked uh do we have membranes

169
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,480
in

170
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,480
reality uh and yes we

171
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:47,040
do we have uh we can manufacture them we

172
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:49,680
make we make we engineer uh

173
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,560
materials these are some YouTube videos

174
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,120
that you may want to to go and watch I'm

175
00:09:52,560 --> 00:10:00,760
not doing it

176
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:03,760
here and uh so you you can essentially

177
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,560
have a wall of uh

178
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:11,079
materials with holes and if the holes

179
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,720
are the proper size they can allow the

180
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:16,120
passage of some particles and prevent

181
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,560
the particles the the other particles to

182
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:21,839
to pass so that is the way we achieve a

183
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,920
semi perable uh

184
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:31,320
membrane in nature also in

185
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:31,320
biology this is very important on the uh

186
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,279
on the surface of

187
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:41,160
cells where you may have uh not you you

188
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,279
may have active and passive

189
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,880
transport active transport is a

190
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:52,120
different story because it requires some

191
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:55,200
energy uh for the um particles to

192
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,480
move but also there is uh passive

193
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,639
transport and the fact that membranes

194
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,560
can be changed

195
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:06,440
uh by the the cell uh depending on its

196
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,959
need so for example if the cell needs to

197
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:14,000
eat so to speak it could open little

198
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:19,000
holes so that the say oxygen comes

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,279
in uh if the cell needs to uh discharge

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
maybe CO2 then it needs to open a little

201
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,839
bigger holes so that the molecules these

202
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,839
molecules can go out

203
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,440
uh I'll have another reference about U

204
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,560
biological structures uh but I don't

205
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,519
want to talk about them because I'm not

206
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,160
at

207
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,160
all expert on

208
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,279
this but so the world is is full of

209
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,519
membranes and we will see more in in a

210
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,519
few

211
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:03,079
moments now there is one uh historical

212
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,000
topic that is maybe interesting just fun

213
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,000
to uh

214
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,360
discuss it's called the Gibs

215
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,199
Paradox and we have the tools to Now

216
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,720
understand what it means and essentially

217
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:22,600
to resolve

218
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:26,279
it the idea is this we just

219
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:29,720
uh mentioned what happens when we have

220
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:32,560
uh particles that mix so here suppose we

221
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,800
are just a binary mixture only two types

222
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,880
of particles the gray and the black and

223
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,120
the spontaneous

224
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,680
mixing occurs this

225
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,560
way and if you compute the entropy of

226
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:50,240
mixing this summation when you have only

227
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:53,480
two uh types of particles becomes a some

228
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,720
of just two terms and of course the mole

229
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,800
fractions when you have two particles

230
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:03,440
are not independent because one because

231
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:07,160
they might they must add up to one so

232
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,880
the mole fraction of the second type

233
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,440
must be equal to one minus the mole

234
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,560
fraction of the first type of

235
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,199
particles in the particular case in

236
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:21,480
which you have 50% of one and 50% of the

237
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:24,519
other so the more fractions are 50% or 1

238
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,040
half this entropy of

239
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,600
mixing

240
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:32,560
becomes

241
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,560
uh n R log of

242
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:40,279
two now if we consider for example a

243
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,720
case in which I

244
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,720
have one

245
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:52,320
particle okay if we express one particle

246
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,320
in terms of

247
00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:01,519
moles uh that's one

248
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,519
over the avado Ross

249
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,079
number

250
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:12,040
mole because in one mole you have these

251
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:15,079
many particles

252
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,440
6022 * 10

253
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:20,800
23rd

254
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:25,680
okay so

255
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:29,759
NR in that case is equal to R

256
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:33,639
over the avocados number

257
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,639
and this is called the boltzman

258
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:44,399
constant which is one of the physical

259
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,399
constants so if we uh suppose

260
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,880
here uh we have

261
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,800
uh

262
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,800
just one particle on one side and one

263
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,800
particle on the other

264
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:04,440
side so the total n is

265
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,680
two it's it's actually two divided by

266
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,279
av's

267
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,600
number

268
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:18,519
so that entropy of mixing is uh

269
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,519
twice BS one constant log of

270
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,639
two okay

271
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,720
so what is the the Gibs

272
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:38,360
Paradox the Gibs Paradox runs as follows

273
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,480
uh

274
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:46,240
um there is a saying uh that

275
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:52,079
uh I know it in

276
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,079
uh in Latin NATA

277
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,399
non

278
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,120
fit

279
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:05,399
salum it means nature doesn't make

280
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:08,399
jumps and this is a I think it goes back

281
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,440
to Aristotle or maybe Li NS I mean

282
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:17,040
everybody every every

283
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:17,040
philosopher uh has uh touched on these

284
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,720
idea so what what Gibbs I think the Gibs

285
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,519
they call it I really don't know maybe

286
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,920
when we should look it up about the

287
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,880
history of these things is is

288
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,880
interesting is a chapter in itself so

289
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,319
I'm not an expert in that in that either

290
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:39,959
but suppose that it was Gibbs who

291
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:45,560
realized that all right suppose

292
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:50,839
I I have um I'm coloring these

293
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,839
particles with a d and so

294
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,399
suppose the amount of

295
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,360
uh

296
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:04,000
distance in color is measured by this

297
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:07,559
parameter Lambda so I say zero means the

298
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,799
particles are the same color Lambda

299
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:13,439
greater than zero it means that the

300
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:13,439
particles are different

301
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,439
color all right so regardless of the

302
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,720
color here we see that the result this

303
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,280
result the entropy of mixing is the same

304
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,839
regardless of how different the

305
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,839
particles

306
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,720
are there is no detail about what the

307
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,320
particles or the mass is it's just how

308
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:40,039
many they

309
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:45,559
are so the entropy of mixing is always

310
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:48,160
given by this amount and are uh log of

311
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,160
two

312
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,440
say

313
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,760
except and so you would you say right as

314
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,480
Lambda goes to zero I would

315
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,120
expect that to also go

316
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,679
uh continuously instead as you go to

317
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:08,080
zero that jumps to

318
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,200
zero

319
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,039
because

320
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,120
we if we think in terms of the simple

321
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:21,159
system model you remember

322
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:23,559
that uh when we have a a pure substance

323
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,919
putting a partition or removing it

324
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:29,440
doesn't change the properties so that's

325
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:33,200
one quick way since we have seen

326
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,000
uh a lot before to show that if the

327
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,000
particles are

328
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,880
identical there will be removing the

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,760
partition will not change any of the

330
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,760
properties including

331
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,840
entropy so there is no entropy of mixing

332
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,039
in this case if you

333
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,919
mix the same substance there is no

334
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:59,280
entropy of mixing as soon as they become

335
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:00,720
different there is entropy of mixing and

336
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,200
it is

337
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,960
discontinuous so that's why the

338
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,960
philosophers didn't like this

339
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,280
idea but in

340
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:22,000
fact it all has to do with the fact that

341
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,000
we are doing modeling of

342
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:26,760
reality

343
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:31,600
so

344
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,600
nature is the way we model

345
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:39,000
it so if we have a possibility to

346
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,520
distinguish the particles and

347
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,400
therefore they are different for us

348
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,440
then there is

349
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:53,039
mixing and if there is entropy of mixing

350
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:57,320
there is also the possibility to do

351
00:19:53,039 --> 00:20:01,000
work as we've seen we can we can do this

352
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:04,559
work this U mixing uh properly and

353
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,520
extract some work

354
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:11,880
but if we don't have uh the possibility

355
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,960
to recognize to identify to distinguish

356
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,679
the

357
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,360
particles that work is impossible for us

358
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:24,720
so it has to do with the the way we

359
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:27,640
model it or if you really want to go

360
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,640
nature if the particles are truly

361
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
indistinguishable

362
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,679
in the sense quantum mechanics

363
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,880
distinguishable

364
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,240
indistinguishable fermion bosons and

365
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,919
that kind of

366
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,720
discussion

367
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:50,120
then there is no way you can distinguish

368
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:55,880
there is no way you can uh extract any

369
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:59,080
work uh if the particles are

370
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:04,520
distinguishable then it all depends

371
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:08,919
on your model namely on your kind of

372
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,919
tool that you are considering in your

373
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:21,080
model so so that's essentially the

374
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:25,240
resolution of the Paradox there's no

375
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:27,679
Paradox it's it's it's through like this

376
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,559
and the this continuity going from here

377
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:34,080
to there

378
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:36,480
is essentially embedded in uh in the our

379
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,799
modeling or from the Practical point of

380
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,559
view our ability to control the

381
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,960
differences in

382
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:49,600
particles because if the particles are

383
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:52,440
different but we have no ways to uh

384
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,480
control their differences and

385
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:59,440
therefore uh

386
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,760
build semi-permeable membranes

387
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,679
that can

388
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:08,760
select then obtaining that

389
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,760
work is out of our

390
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:16,000
reach

391
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,000
okay so that's the Gibs

392
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,320
Paradox and since we are at it I want to

393
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,880
take a little DET tour today

394
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:35,880
uh uh also on some other topics that

395
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:39,279
are important in statistics in

396
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:42,200
information Theory and also in Quantum

397
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,200
uh

398
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,960
Theory so again look at this um box with

399
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,960
particles different

400
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:59,799
particles and suppose you make an

401
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:02,440
experiment by having a little um

402
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:06,880
window someplace like a control volume

403
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,880
somewhere in that in that U uh

404
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,080
container where you can look if there is

405
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,799
a particle in there there can be only

406
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,559
one at a time it's a small control

407
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:20,159
volume

408
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:23,000
you you write it down in your

409
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:27,000
experimental uh uh

410
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,200
notebook I say oh yeah I saw a molecule

411
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,200
of nitrogen or I saw a molecule of

412
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:38,080
oxygen or I saw a molecule of

413
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,400
argon or I saw a molecule of

414
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,279
CO2 if that's

415
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,360
air this

416
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:48,120
is uh the

417
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,120
idea and if you are in a stable in a

418
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,120
stable equilibrium

419
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:59,159
State um and

420
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,679
therefore the probabilities

421
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:05,679
that you find that you observe one of

422
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,400
these molecules is

423
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,320
proportional to the fraction of

424
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,640
particles overall so it's the mole

425
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,840
fraction so the mole fraction which by

426
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,320
the way is a number like probability now

427
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,760
it's a number between zero and one and

428
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,120
it adds up to

429
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:27,279
one so the mo fraction is the

430
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:30,279
probability to get the particle of that

431
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,279
type

432
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,960
okay so there is

433
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:47,000
a a measure if so if

434
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,240
you if you are facing this situation

435
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,240
with

436
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,080
probabilities you are in an

437
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,760
uncertainty

438
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,840
situation you are uncertain uncertain

439
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,440
about

440
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,640
what will be the outcome of the next

441
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:09,320
observation you cannot

442
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:12,799
predict the next time that's what I will

443
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:15,919
get but you can predict because you know

444
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:20,760
the mo fractions with what frequency you

445
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,760
will get these results upon repeated

446
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:28,840
measurement but when you are facing uh

447
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,960
the next observation and uh you a big

448
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,000
question mark in your in your mind and

449
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,559
asking all right what will be the next

450
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,760
outcome you are in a state of

451
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:42,120
uncertainty and the the

452
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:47,320
uncertainty can be

453
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:49,279
measured by this measure of

454
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,360
information is called the Shannon

455
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:57,799
information entropy Shannon

456
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,640
1948 uh said well if I uh look at the

457
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:04,240
situation described by probabilities

458
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:09,240
like these events and I want to find uh

459
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:12,240
the most uh uh logical

460
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,399
uh mathematical expression or or

461
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:19,240
function of these probabilities that

462
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:19,240
expresses my state of

463
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,640
uncertainty he set up some postulates

464
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:29,200
some desiderata about this measurement

465
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,960
uh um

466
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,240
function of

467
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,919
probabilities and uh the only function

468
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,919
that satisfies those criteria is this

469
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,360
one for

470
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,279
example see if you are that is equal to

471
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:54,799
zero if you have certainty so if if the

472
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:56,760
probabilities are all zeros except one

473
00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:00,159
event that is equal to

474
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:04,000
one so you have certainty so particles

475
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:09,720
of only one Type M fraction is

476
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:12,720
one okay uh well log of

477
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:18,480
one is

478
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:21,840
zero and X log X for those that are zero

479
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,520
is again zero because you remember that

480
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:30,600
this functions uh P log

481
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:32,919
P look this way between zero and one

482
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:37,279
this is the

483
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:39,679
function uh X log

484
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,799
X

485
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:47,080
okay so in that case of complete

486
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,080
certainty the information entropy is

487
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:55,679
zero or on the opposite side if all

488
00:27:52,080 --> 00:28:00,240
particles have equal

489
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:02,080
probability so all the uh Mo fractions

490
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,799
are

491
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:10,000
equal and in that case uh the

492
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,840
entropy is equal to

493
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:18,159
uh

494
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:20,320
log of n of uh the number of of log of R

495
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,760
in this case it's it's the number of

496
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,760
different

497
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,720
particles you can work it out you

498
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,000
substitute each probability is one

499
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,919
over

500
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,919
R and that this summation gives a um log

501
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,960
of

502
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:43,120
R that's the maximum the most uncertain

503
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,159
situation when they're all

504
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,120
alike if you have instead a situation

505
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:52,640
like uh for the molecules of

506
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,640
air it's not

507
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:59,000
even and therefore some are more uh

508
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:03,320
frequent than others so you could get

509
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,679
you could guess some uh um some better

510
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,679
than if everything was just

511
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,279
50% you can also

512
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:18,159
view this is interesting also for us for

513
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:20,760
the next step in the next definition

514
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:24,159
of ideal

515
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,600
solution you can also view this as a

516
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,600
weighted

517
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:35,159
sum weight on the mole

518
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:37,640
fractions see I can view this as the

519
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:41,480
summation the mole

520
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:45,000
fraction times

521
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,000
minus log of

522
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:52,039
Y now this term in parenthesis we

523
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:54,919
could call it the

524
00:29:52,039 --> 00:30:00,039
surprise the

525
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:00,039
surprise the surprise is a measure

526
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,799
uh it's high for the least probable

527
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:15,440
ones so if I get H I could say that if I

528
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:18,840
get a if I see a molecule of CO2

529
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,519
there and I know that there are only 500

530
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:25,039
ppms part per million so there is very

531
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:29,039
low probability so if I see that one I'm

532
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:31,159
kind of more surprised than if I see

533
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:35,360
nitrogen or an

534
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:37,679
oxygen argon also is a bit of a surprise

535
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,799
because argon is less than

536
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:45,200
1% so I need

537
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:46,600
to uh do 100 trials to have on average

538
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:52,240
one

539
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:56,679
argon and uh here I need the uh

540
00:30:52,240 --> 00:31:01,000
2,000 trials to get one

541
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,000
CO2 okay so that's the

542
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:09,159
surprise now in information Theory there

543
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:11,919
is also this problem that is also

544
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:16,120
relevant for uh

545
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,120
measurements for example suppose that

546
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:23,600
you uh your device that finds the

547
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,960
particle uh and characterizes the

548
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,039
particle by uh the

549
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,840
mass so when the when the particle is in

550
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:33,960
your

551
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,519
window your

552
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,639
device uh maybe a spectrometer or

553
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:42,639
whatever it tells you okay it was a mass

554
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:42,639
a particle with this

555
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:51,919
Mass so in the end when you do a

556
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,639
measurement like a repeated uh

557
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,799
measurement procedure in the end you

558
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:59,399
will

559
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:01,120
find uh the average or the

560
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:03,519
mean

561
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,000
mass that shows

562
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:10,039
up and suppose that that's all that you

563
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,039
can measure of your

564
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:16,000
substance so all you can measure is the

565
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,000
average value of the

566
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:25,279
mass if that's the only information I

567
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:28,279
have about my system could I make an

568
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,080
educated guess of what the probability

569
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,880
uh distribution so therefore what the

570
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,880
mole fractions

571
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:41,279
are and here

572
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:44,639
comes U information Theory and again

573
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:48,600
based on Shannon information

574
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:48,600
entropy you say all

575
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,840
right in order to make the educated

576
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:59,039
guess I should uh

577
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:02,440
avoid any bias that is not contained in

578
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,600
the information I have about the system

579
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,760
so I should

580
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,360
use the information I have the measured

581
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:15,720
values but not extra

582
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:19,279
stuff so I want to make the least biased

583
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:22,240
guess and the least guy bias guess is is

584
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,279
obtained by saying all right what is the

585
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,880
probability

586
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:28,679
distribution that maximizes the shown

587
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,799
information

588
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,880
in other words it leaves me with the

589
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:38,159
highest possible uncertainty compatible

590
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:42,440
with that mean value that I I have

591
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:45,799
observed in this way if uh I have not

592
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,080
built in uh the probability distribution

593
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:51,080
any extra

594
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,080
information

595
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,399
uh and so mathematically this means you

596
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,639
have to

597
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,519
maximize the on

598
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:06,840
entropy subject to the constraint that

599
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:10,159
your mean value be the non or measured

600
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:12,320
value of course you also have to put the

601
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,720
uh auxiliary constraint that

602
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,119
probabilities must add up to

603
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:21,359
one and if you solve

604
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,119
this uh problem with the method of

605
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,800
lrange

606
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,119
multipliers I'm don't want to just go

607
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,520
over that today but maybe later on on WE

608
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:36,399
since we uh we we will uh will we'll

609
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:40,960
review it uh uh in any case I presume

610
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:44,560
that you have seen it somewhere else uh

611
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,040
so the method simply says all right if

612
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,440
you have a constraint maximization you

613
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,639
must assign to each of the constraints a

614
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,079
lrange multip a multiplier and under

615
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,079
term in the

616
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:02,480
multiplier uh then

617
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,040
do an unconstrained maximization of the

618
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,160
optimizing

619
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:10,680
function uh minus the constraints

620
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:13,400
multiplied by these

621
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,680
multipliers and then once you obtain the

622
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,400
solution of the unconstrained maximum in

623
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,480
terms of these multipliers you will

624
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,320
substitute back into the constraints and

625
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,599
uh get the values for the multipliers

626
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,800
all right that's

627
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:29,839
a quick so I don't expect you to have

628
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,520
learned it from from these words but in

629
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:34,960
any case if you do the job here's the

630
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,280
probability distribution that you

631
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,240
get and

632
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,960
uh if you

633
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,720
substitute this probability back into

634
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,480
the

635
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,119
constraint this one that gives you the

636
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:52,480
average

637
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:55,920
M it uh gives you a

638
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:59,359
relation between the Lambda M which is

639
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,960
the lrange multiplier and the mean value

640
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:05,440
so you get that the lrange multiplier

641
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:08,000
depends on that mean value of the

642
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:12,359
mass so this is the

643
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,640
best or at least the least biased

644
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:21,079
assignment of M fractions that you can

645
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,079
do upon a measurement of only the

646
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:31,680
mass we will see in a while that uh this

647
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,400
probability

648
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,880
distribution is very similar to what you

649
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:42,000
obtain uh what you have for the

650
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:45,599
description of stable equilibrium States

651
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,920
within statistical mechanics and quantum

652
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,720
theory it's called the canonical

653
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:55,240
distribution If instead of mass you put

654
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:58,119
energy and that allows or

655
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,599
allowed uh

656
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,800
researchers like uh

657
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:07,839
James it's a big

658
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:11,160
name who made uh

659
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:14,760
these very neat connections between

660
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,760
information Theory and statistical

661
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:24,319
mechanics or also uh if

662
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:27,720
you if you if you still go to the

663
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:31,240
library here at MIT there is a wonderful

664
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:34,079
um set of video

665
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:40,280
lectures by Professor myON

666
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:40,280
tribus back in I think the 60s or the

667
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:47,440
70s uh where he does uh the information

668
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,240
Theory point of view of thermodynamics

669
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,839
so he develops the entire thermodynamics

670
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,520
just by building up on uh information

671
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:58,599
Theory

672
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:01,720
concept and indeed

673
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:04,960
there is uh a ground for doing it

674
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:08,920
because the molecular view that we are

675
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:13,200
discussing here and the tools developed

676
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:13,200
by Shannon do pro do provide that

677
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:24,400
possibility so I said that I wanted to

678
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,839
make a little uh degression today

679
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,440
so here is a degression in the

680
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:29,440
degression

681
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,720
and

682
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,720
uh it has to

683
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,720
do with the

684
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,200
treatment of a

685
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:45,200
particle in a

686
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:59,920
box okay so we take a

687
00:38:52,960 --> 00:39:00,680
box of uh sides L1 L2 and L3 in the

688
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,440
three

689
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,359
directions and we consider only one

690
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,920
particle inside this

691
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,920
box that's the

692
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:19,280
idea of uh of this little uh survey of

693
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:22,440
uh with some equations that are borrowed

694
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,440
from quantum

695
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:29,359
mechanics

696
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:33,880
uh which you may be familiar or not but

697
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:36,000
uh uh even if you are not it's okay this

698
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,079
is a just a quick

699
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,480
view that tells you how all these things

700
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:48,400
are related so it might might be

701
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:50,560
interesting um I will not ask for this

702
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,040
in in

703
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:58,040
the oral exam of course and actually one

704
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:01,359
day I will let you know

705
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:07,680
which are of the many things that we

706
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:10,000
cover the uh slides that uh are to be um

707
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,720
I me are going to be part of the exam so

708
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,720
that you can focus and because otherwise

709
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:21,640
it's too much I I perfectly realize all

710
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:26,160
right so uh the idea in quantum

711
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:28,119
mechanics is that um in order to uh

712
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,000
describe uh

713
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:34,319
molecule like that or even

714
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,359
simpler if you have a molecule on a

715
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:39,359
one-dimensional box that we already

716
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:39,359
mentioned

717
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,200
uh so suppose we have just

718
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,960
onedimensional

719
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:52,720
box in classical mechanics the particle

720
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:58,319
is here and it goes uh back and forth

721
00:40:52,720 --> 00:41:01,880
It's Perfectly uh uh situated somewhere

722
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:04,800
at every instant of time in uh quantum

723
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:08,400
mechanics the story is different

724
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:11,119
particle cannot be is not I mean the the

725
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,440
idea of viewing the particle as

726
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:17,280
localized is wrong it gives you some

727
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:20,760
results that that are

728
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:24,359
wrong so the idea of quantum mechanics

729
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:28,359
is that you start from you have

730
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:28,359
to uh

731
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,520
find a

732
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:37,760
probability

733
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:41,280
distribution which uh can be obtained by

734
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,280
a function let's say

735
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,839
Fe

736
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:52,280
okay and this

737
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:57,839
function uh is the uh

738
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:57,839
solution of U an igen value problem

739
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,480
and uh for

740
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:08,960
example first of all this function can

741
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:12,200
be also written as uh the

742
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:16,800
factors so it's a product of a function

743
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:21,720
of X and the function of uh

744
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:24,240
time and the function of time uh

745
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:29,200
remember uh it's

746
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:32,480
minus uh H bar times the

747
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,480
energy times time

748
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,480
over

749
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:47,319
something it will it will come up uh

750
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,319
somewhere uh over M

751
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:58,079
probably not sure okay so the idea is

752
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,319
that this function here the one that

753
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,240
depends on

754
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:09,440
X is the solution of an igen value uh

755
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:11,839
problem uh

756
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:16,440
and these

757
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,440
functions are you can plot them as

758
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:28,839
follows as we as we know uh um actually

759
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:31,800
I think we have we have the expression

760
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:33,720
it's something like square root of

761
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,839
uh

762
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:41,160
um 2 over

763
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:43,359
L where L is the side so this is from

764
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,359
zero to

765
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,359
L

766
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:58,680
times s of uh some

767
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:58,680
J some maybe X

768
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:08,319
and there are some other constants here

769
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:13,480
that I now slips uh my uh

770
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:21,119
memory and it's maybe

771
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:21,119
uh maybe uh H over 2 m or something like

772
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:29,040
that or maybe also an

773
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,040
L uh there is also an L here

774
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:38,119
okay so the idea is that this

775
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:42,079
J is the integer

776
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:45,000
numbers so there are many possible uh

777
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:48,359
contributions each one of these for each

778
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,599
J corresponds to a

779
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:52,000
solution uh and to that solution

780
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:56,480
corresponds

781
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,079
also a uh an energy level so for example

782
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,119
the the low lowest energy level

783
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:06,119
corresponding to J is equal to

784
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:06,119
1 is a function like

785
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,520
this then you may have the second energy

786
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:20,160
level uh in

787
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:24,040
which the

788
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,040
function is something like

789
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:33,079
this and then J equal to uh

790
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,720
3 right and so

791
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:49,559
on corresponding to each of these

792
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,079
JS there are

793
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:57,240
energies or actually on the slide I'm

794
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,240
calling them uh Epsilon J

795
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:04,640
okay and these energies are

796
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:10,640
H squar over 2

797
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,640
m multiplied by J 2 over L

798
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,200
2 maybe there's a pi

799
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:24,280
here because it needs to go to to to

800
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:28,920
zero at zero and at L

801
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,920
so okay so that means

802
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:36,079
that if this Epsilon one is the lowest

803
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,079
energy

804
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:42,359
level Epsilon

805
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:46,040
2 is equal

806
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:51,280
to uh it corresponds to J equals 2 so

807
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:51,280
it's equals to j s is four times Epsilon

808
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,480
1 and Epsilon 3

809
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:06,040
is 3 to the 2 so it's 9 * Epsilon

810
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,040
1 and so on

811
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:14,599
okay so already this gives you the

812
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:18,200
energy

813
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:22,599
levels now in an in an experiment that

814
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:25,440
you do for example with uh

815
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:28,079
spectroscopy on the

816
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,400
particle uh you can measure the energy

817
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,400
of the

818
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,000
particle and it and you're facing a

819
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:39,040
situation like the one that we just done

820
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,359
with the uh the mass of the particles

821
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:44,200
that you don't know which one uh okay

822
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:49,160
here it's a similar situation you do a

823
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:50,000
measurement of energy and you don't know

824
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:54,240
which

825
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,839
one of the energies possible energies

826
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,720
you get because the particle is not the

827
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:01,960
definitely on this not always I mean

828
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:05,319
most of the times it's in a

829
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:08,200
superposition of energy levels so each

830
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:12,079
one of them has a

831
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:14,400
probability and the energy of uh of the

832
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,040
particle is the weighted sum of these

833
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,000
probabilities with with these

834
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:20,000
probabilities of these energy

835
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:29,680
levels so the state

836
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:32,960
of the particle is represented by a

837
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:36,079
probability distribution which

838
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:40,400
uh at least in the stable equilibrium

839
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:44,920
States can be viewed as the uh

840
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:47,520
probability of finding the energy levels

841
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,520
among these

842
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,000
possibilities that is for the particle

843
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:56,559
in one uh dimensional box if you have a

844
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,799
three dimensional box each Direction has

845
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:01,640
a it

846
00:48:57,799 --> 00:49:04,000
own contribution and actually this

847
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:06,079
functions

848
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,640
Factor so the

849
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,799
three uh orthogonal translational

850
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:15,359
degrees of freedom of the

851
00:49:11,799 --> 00:49:19,319
particle super superposed to in each

852
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:24,280
other so it's like uh uh having three

853
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:27,359
kind of uh of of of sub particles like

854
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,559
in a perfect gas that uh sort of don't

855
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:33,520
that ignore each other each each degree

856
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:37,200
of Freedom lives by itself occupies uh

857
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:39,880
its uh directional modes by itself

858
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:44,920
without interacting with the other

859
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:49,160
modes that's why this is such a simple

860
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:54,040
uh uh extension of that just multiply so

861
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,040
to speak or the the various uh

862
00:49:54,599 --> 00:50:00,599
functions not only but

863
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:03,240
from this one from these results you can

864
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:07,079
also obtain the

865
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:08,480
probability of finding um the prob

866
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:11,200
probability

867
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:14,799
density of

868
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:17,440
finding this uh uh particle if you make

869
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:20,359
a position measurement finding it

870
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,839
between X X and X Plus

871
00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:29,280
DX that's the PDF the probability

872
00:50:22,839 --> 00:50:29,280
density function it's given by the is

873
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:36,599
s the modulus of this one or also that

874
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,599
one

875
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:43,680
and I think there is an I here that I am

876
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:47,880
missing because this is supposed to be

877
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:51,680
uh I is the square root of minus one

878
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:54,000
okay so that means that when I do uh the

879
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:57,720
complex conjugate of this one that be

880
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:03,240
that I becomes minus I

881
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:07,240
and so the modulus uh of V is equal to

882
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:10,960
this one cancels and you're left

883
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,960
with uh

884
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:19,400
this which is the modulus of uh s

885
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:21,839
squared and that is the probability

886
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,319
density function so if you want to know

887
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:28,559
how much is the probability in that

888
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:28,559
interval you multiply by DX

889
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:36,200
and if you want to know um the

890
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,799
probability to go from to be from uh say

891
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:43,599
from here to there you just do the

892
00:51:38,799 --> 00:51:45,880
integral from uh whatever X say X1 to X2

893
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:49,200
to get to get the overall

894
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:53,240
distribution so these

895
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,240
functions are these ones that I

896
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:00,480
plotted I wish I had more space okay

897
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,480
let's do this

898
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,880
way so the

899
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:15,079
probabilities are the

900
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:18,240
square of these functions see this the

901
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:21,280
way functions can go negative but the

902
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:26,119
probability is essentially the

903
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:28,920
square so take the square of this sign

904
00:52:26,119 --> 00:52:33,240
and become something like

905
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:38,200
this the square of this other uh sign

906
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:38,200
with it becomes something like

907
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,359
this and so

908
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,440
on and so on

909
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:59,760
okay when the particle is in a given

910
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:05,920
State uh it is not typically in just one

911
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,359
of these energy

912
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,319
levels it is in a probability

913
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:16,359
distribution so each one of

914
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:19,000
these um distributions in space is is

915
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:22,559
weighted by a probability distribution

916
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:27,359
so there will be a P1 it will be a P2 a

917
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,480
P3 and so on so you have

918
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:31,599
a weighted

919
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,960
sum of these probabilities with which

920
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,760
you can compute for

921
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,559
example uh the

922
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:42,680
um probability that your particles is

923
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:42,680
between X and X Plus

924
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,240
DX it's this area times

925
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:58,079
P1 plus this area time

926
00:53:52,520 --> 00:54:01,400
P2 plus that area time P3 up to to

927
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:04,559
Infinity because you have to go up this

928
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,559
J goes up to

929
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:12,640
infinity and that's how you

930
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,640
compute the actual stable equilibrium

931
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,640
State probability

932
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:20,839
distribution this is already we already

933
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:24,000
mentioned the fact that when you do this

934
00:54:20,839 --> 00:54:27,240
job and you can compute therefore

935
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,640
the uh the probability density

936
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:34,079
for every for every X you will find that

937
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:37,960
it will always go to zero uh at the

938
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:40,440
edges because at the edges no matter how

939
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:42,240
you weight it it's always zero so the

940
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:45,839
sum of zero is

941
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:51,680
zero whereas in the

942
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:51,680
center uh it you'll have some

943
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:57,040
Wiggles

944
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:00,079
especially if the

945
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:04,400
low energy levels are important as you

946
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:08,720
go upwards this becomes so uh you may

947
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:13,160
have if the quantum number goes um as it

948
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:16,359
goes higher these Wiggles become more uh

949
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:19,400
intense and then they add up and so the

950
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:22,079
one cancels the others and so the zero

951
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:26,359
you'll get only zero at the walls but

952
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,359
not in the middle not in the bulk

953
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:34,640
okay so these are the energy

954
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:38,880
levels here is the name for the

955
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:41,920
probabilities that we simplified

956
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,079
here in three dimensions you have three

957
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,319
labels because you have one quantum

958
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,319
number per

959
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:53,000
Direction and the typical

960
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,960
problem that you face if you do energy

961
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:03,319
measure measurements

962
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:06,440
is well how do I what's my best guess

963
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:06,440
for this probability

964
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:12,240
distribution that's the information

965
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,240
Theory point of

966
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:21,559
view uh the thermodynamics point of view

967
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:26,559
is all right probabilities if we accept

968
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:29,839
that probabilities represent the state

969
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:32,640
and if we accept that

970
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:34,880
entropy uh is measured by a function

971
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,880
like

972
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:41,359
this then we can use the maximum entropy

973
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:45,000
principle which

974
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:45,000
says for a given

975
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:53,680
energy my

976
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,680
system uh has

977
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:01,280
um see of have an energy and an entropy

978
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:05,119
an entropy

979
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,119
diagram and for a given

980
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:11,880
energy I may have many different

981
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,880
states but if I'm looking for the stable

982
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:18,160
equilibrium State I know that it has to

983
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,760
have the maximum entropy for that given

984
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,960
energy so that's precisely the same

985
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:26,160
problem that we've seen before maximize

986
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,920
entropy and provided you accept that for

987
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:31,760
fora for the entropy of the Quantum of

988
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:31,760
the quantum

989
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:41,160
particle then the mathematics of uh

990
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,160
maximization is the same use lrange

991
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:47,000
multipliers now see since we know

992
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:49,280
already the

993
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:52,640
answer instead of call calling the

994
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:54,880
lrange multiplier Lambda e

995
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,839
which

996
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,880
um uh

997
00:57:56,839 --> 00:58:00,799
since later on WE recognize that that

998
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,240
Lambda is the inverse of the temperature

999
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:08,000
divided by the boltman constant we we

1000
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,000
already call it 1 /

1001
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:13,799
KT and so you find this

1002
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:16,079
distribution so the

1003
00:58:13,799 --> 00:58:18,559
probabilities are given by e to the

1004
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:21,920
minus the

1005
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:25,480
energy is energy

1006
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,680
values divided by or multiplied by the

1007
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:32,720
lrange multi

1008
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:35,440
mullier divided by this Q you can view

1009
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:38,160
it as a normalization factor it's

1010
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,400
essentially the summation of all these

1011
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:43,640
things at the

1012
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,640
numerator this

1013
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:53,760
q a also see that since the energies the

1014
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:57,200
energy I values add

1015
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:59,839
up uh the exponential of sum is equal to

1016
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:03,640
the product of the exponentials so these

1017
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:06,160
probability distributions

1018
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:09,039
factor

1019
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:12,960
into separate probability distributions

1020
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:17,440
for each of the directions of the

1021
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:21,039
box so so you can view the problem also

1022
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,559
just as you can solve it in One

1023
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:27,280
Direction per time and then simply

1024
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:27,280
multiply the results

1025
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:35,480
these denominators or denominator for

1026
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:35,480
the overall is called the partition

1027
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,839
function and uh it is yes it plays the

1028
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:44,680
role

1029
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:47,400
of the normalization factor so that

1030
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:48,720
uh uh when you sum the probabilities

1031
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,720
they add up to

1032
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:54,839
one but it also plays an interesting

1033
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:57,799
interesting role because uh uh uh

1034
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:59,520
essentially all you you you can extract

1035
00:59:57,799 --> 01:00:02,440
everything if you know this partition

1036
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:05,400
function if you know this

1037
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,119
summation by playing with it in terms of

1038
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:11,520
taking some

1039
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:14,039
derivatives you can get uh everything of

1040
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,599
the distribution including the the

1041
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:18,880
probabilities

1042
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:22,680
themselves so if you take the the

1043
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:26,440
partial derivative of the logarithm of

1044
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:28,480
the partition function as written here

1045
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,680
and take the derivative with respect to

1046
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,480
the energy

1047
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:38,319
level you get the probability and

1048
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:41,799
multiply by KT and minus you get the

1049
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:44,480
probability of that energy of observing

1050
01:00:41,799 --> 01:00:44,480
that energy

1051
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:51,240
level

1052
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:54,359
or you take this other derivative you

1053
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:58,319
take the derivative of Q respect to

1054
01:00:54,359 --> 01:01:01,559
temperature because yes in a moment will

1055
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:01,559
recognize that

1056
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:09,240
U this

1057
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:12,559
T is also this lrange

1058
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:14,839
multiplier satisfies our definition of

1059
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,319
temperature is the partial of s e with

1060
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:20,720
respect to

1061
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:24,280
S and so you identify it with the

1062
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:27,240
temperature uh so you take the log the

1063
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:31,039
partial of log Q respect respect to

1064
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:34,880
t uh you get the

1065
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:37,119
energy the mean energy the mean energy

1066
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,559
is the average value of the energy it's

1067
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:43,079
so it's the weighted sum of these energy

1068
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:46,200
levels weighted on the probability that

1069
01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:46,200
represents that

1070
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:51,680
state and also uh the

1071
01:01:52,359 --> 01:01:56,359
entropy also the entropy because the

1072
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:59,200
probabilties

1073
01:01:56,359 --> 01:02:01,279
Factor the entropies add because the

1074
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:05,960
logarithm you remember the logarithm of

1075
01:02:01,279 --> 01:02:08,920
the product is equal to the sum of the

1076
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:12,000
logarithms so you can write the overall

1077
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:15,160
entropy and split it in the entropies of

1078
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:19,119
the three directions of the

1079
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:22,799
box and each one of them can be obtained

1080
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:25,480
as a proper derivative of

1081
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:28,359
Q or if you already taken the derivative

1082
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:31,680
that give the energy you can write S as

1083
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:34,480
e/ t

1084
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,279
plus bman constant time times the

1085
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:41,319
logarithm of the partition

1086
01:02:36,279 --> 01:02:44,559
function this is somehow uh close to

1087
01:02:41,319 --> 01:02:49,000
the as close as you can get to the oiler

1088
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:49,000
free free energy or the free energy

1089
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:57,599
because in fact some people call it call

1090
01:02:54,200 --> 01:03:07,000
I mean you could also rewrite that as

1091
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:09,240
EI minus t SI I is equal to uh KB t log

1092
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,240
of

1093
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:15,240
Q probabbly with the minus sign

1094
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:23,160
yeah okay

1095
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,680
okay

1096
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:41,079
so now going

1097
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:41,079
back to these

1098
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,880
probabilities this probability

1099
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,880
distribution is the one that

1100
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:53,119
characterizes the stable equilibrium

1101
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:57,720
state it characterizes this

1102
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,720
state how about these other ones

1103
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,200
okay

1104
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:11,000
okay

1105
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:14,680
so this canonical distribution the one

1106
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:17,200
maximum entropy one looks like

1107
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:20,000
this here for

1108
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:22,720
Simplicity I have drawn a system which

1109
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:27,240
doesn't have a

1110
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:29,640
uh this I value structure but it has

1111
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:33,680
energy levels that are equally spaced

1112
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:38,599
and there is only seven of them the

1113
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:41,799
lowest one one two 3 four five six seven

1114
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:41,799
okay equally

1115
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:47,640
spaced we have

1116
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,760
already uh mentioned that they that for

1117
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:57,559
a system with an upper bound to the uh

1118
01:04:53,760 --> 01:05:01,119
energy Spectrum this is an R

1119
01:04:57,559 --> 01:05:01,119
here that would be

1120
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:08,839
Spectrum the the ersus diagram doesn't

1121
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:13,400
go up indefinitely but it bends and

1122
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:13,400
returns so that's that's the

1123
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:20,400
case so we have only seven energy levels

1124
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:23,760
and we can uh picture these

1125
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:26,039
probabilities by an instogram

1126
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,319
histogram so this is the max maximum

1127
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:31,640
entropy the canonical

1128
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:34,760
distribution for example this is a zero

1129
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:37,640
entropy a zero entropy state in what is

1130
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:41,079
one in which you are

1131
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:43,079
certain remember the the the entropy in

1132
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:45,880
in terms of probabilities represents

1133
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:48,599
your state of uncertainty well if I know

1134
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:51,920
that every time I measure I always find

1135
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:55,160
the particle in that energy level uh I

1136
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:59,680
have no uncertainty the entropy is zero

1137
01:05:55,160 --> 01:06:03,240
and that is when uh I have zeros for

1138
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:06,000
all um Poss probabilities except one

1139
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:06,000
which is equal to

1140
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:13,799
one a point like

1141
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:17,559
here is one that has an intermediate

1142
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:17,559
probability between zero and the

1143
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:24,960
maximum you can

1144
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:27,000
concoct uh an infinite number of

1145
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:31,520
possibilities

1146
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:34,520
of different probabilities probability

1147
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:36,119
distributions that have the same entropy

1148
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:39,440
and of course the same

1149
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:42,440
energy here are the

1150
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,440
ones

1151
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:49,279
okay uh why is that

1152
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:55,599
important okay when

1153
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:57,760
we when we are interested in describing

1154
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:00,960
non-equilibrium

1155
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:05,200
States what is important is

1156
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:08,520
to uh be able to understand or

1157
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:10,000
model how these states or these

1158
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:14,079
probability

1159
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:16,200
distributions evolve towards equilibrium

1160
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:18,839
because

1161
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:24,319
nature F salum

1162
01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:27,520
but uh nature usually likes to go

1163
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:27,520
towards equilibrium

1164
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:33,960
and so there is a spontaneous uh

1165
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:42,200
tendency so there is a natural law that

1166
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:42,200
pushes a Pro system to uh even out or

1167
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:48,079
redistribute the energy load you can

1168
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:51,400
interpret these u in

1169
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:54,240
histograms as uh the probabilities you

1170
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,960
see is written here measure the degree

1171
01:07:54,240 --> 01:08:00,720
of involvement

1172
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:03,000
of level of level EJ in sharing the mean

1173
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:08,520
energy

1174
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:11,359
load you give some energy to the

1175
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:15,960
particle and the

1176
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:19,799
particle has to decide where to put it

1177
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:21,839
it can put it um in in translational

1178
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:24,560
mode but as we've seen here if the

1179
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:27,600
particle is confined the translational

1180
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,480
modes have this kind of energy levels so

1181
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,759
how much energy do I put in this mode

1182
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:36,920
and how much in that and how much in

1183
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:41,359
that if the particle also has a internal

1184
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:44,319
structure uh so for example it could uh

1185
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:45,600
vibrate or if it if it has a structure

1186
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:50,000
so that it can

1187
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:52,960
rotate can put also you get additional

1188
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,719
modes uh rotational

1189
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:59,239
modes uh and then you have electron iic

1190
01:08:55,719 --> 01:09:00,199
modes all right so the particle uh has

1191
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:04,799
to

1192
01:09:00,199 --> 01:09:06,759
decide how to distribute and uh uh

1193
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:11,359
distribute

1194
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:11,359
evenly so if it is

1195
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:19,359
unconstrained the the most even

1196
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,880
distribution is the maximum

1197
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:24,359
entropy the equilibrium one at

1198
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:26,319
equilibrium it will have distributed

1199
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:30,640
things so as to Max maximize the entropy

1200
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:32,759
so entropy also measures the uh degree

1201
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,759
of

1202
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:42,480
sharing the highest degree of sharing is

1203
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:46,520
achieved here and the natural phenomena

1204
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:49,799
are in common have in common the idea

1205
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:53,960
that there is a spontaneous tendency to

1206
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:55,960
uh uh share uh the energy as evenly

1207
01:09:53,960 --> 01:10:00,600
possible as possible

1208
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:00,600
uh among the uh available energy

1209
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,760
levels

1210
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:11,000
so the question about Dynamics is how do

1211
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:13,600
this thing evolve in time and here I

1212
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,280
have a slide with a

1213
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:18,880
some uh animation hopefully it should

1214
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,880
work let's

1215
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:29,400
see yeah okay so for example I started

1216
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:33,400
from very close to uh zero entropy and

1217
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:36,440
this is a smooth transition in which uh

1218
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:39,840
the particle while keeping the energy

1219
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:43,040
constant redistributes the probabilities

1220
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:47,239
until it eventually achieves the stable

1221
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:47,239
equilibrium canonical

1222
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:53,600
distribution

1223
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:56,159
okay and also this one is another

1224
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:59,239
example

1225
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:00,920
started from an intermediate state with

1226
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:06,280
two

1227
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:10,400
initially uh full um energy levels and

1228
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:10,400
the the other ones get

1229
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:16,040
filled until in the end you get to the

1230
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:16,040
same

1231
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:26,360
state I rescued

1232
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:29,199
these view graphs from U

1233
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,199
work that I had

1234
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,760
done for my PhD thesis

1235
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:37,320
here

1236
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:45,159
1981 to devise a an equation of motion

1237
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:48,239
that would take any probability

1238
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:52,880
distribution of this sort and

1239
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:55,480
evolves uh it smoothly towards a stable

1240
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:59,199
equilibrium

1241
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:04,040
and that's developed in the subject that

1242
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:07,840
um u i Now call it steepest entropy

1243
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:10,280
asent but also has to do with what I

1244
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:14,199
like to call the forlow of

1245
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:17,320
thermodynamics because essentially this

1246
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:18,719
kind of uh dynamical description of

1247
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:23,480
non-e equilibrium

1248
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:26,320
States is uh is is common of a large

1249
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:29,639
number of theories of on

1250
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:31,159
equilibrium there are some

1251
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:34,000
features

1252
01:12:31,159 --> 01:12:36,719
uh and

1253
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:39,960
uh and there are some aspects some

1254
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:42,920
general aspects of this modeling

1255
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:48,080
uh

1256
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:50,360
ideas uh that are so uh common in spite

1257
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,280
of the different fields in which you

1258
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:56,560
find

1259
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:57,880
them uh uh that you can say that perhaps

1260
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,159
they

1261
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:06,320
represent uh another law

1262
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:10,280
of shouldn't say of nature but in our

1263
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:14,120
law another law of uh modeling nature

1264
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:17,400
correctly like the second law we have uh

1265
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:19,560
described as something that uh your

1266
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:23,480
model should not violate otherwise it is

1267
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:27,880
a bad model okay also the forth flow

1268
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:31,000
will be something that is similarly to

1269
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:32,840
be uh satisfied if your model has to

1270
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,199
provide a

1271
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:38,760
compatible description of how States

1272
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:41,520
evolve towards equilibrium uh in

1273
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:46,280
compatible with all we know

1274
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,280
about evidence of of physical

1275
01:13:48,679 --> 01:13:55,480
reality well little more because we

1276
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:58,360
haven't done we haven't finished the yet

1277
01:13:55,480 --> 01:14:01,360
with the particle in the

1278
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:01,360
Box

1279
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:13,199
um let me uh take it um start again from

1280
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:17,080
the partition function

1281
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:17,080
Q of the onedimensional

1282
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:25,159
case which is therefore this summation

1283
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:28,159
of e to the uh the energy levels over KT

1284
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:31,480
and here are the energy levels uh

1285
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:33,800
substituted directly so you see now in

1286
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:35,480
this expression what are the fixed the

1287
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:39,639
parameters I mean some are physical

1288
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:43,800
constants plank constant H uh bman

1289
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:47,440
constant KB m is the mass of your

1290
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:49,600
particle J is just the dummy variable in

1291
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:52,360
this summation there are only two

1292
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:55,639
parameters in this formula T which is

1293
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:59,920
the temperature and L which which is the

1294
01:14:55,639 --> 01:15:02,280
side the size of of the box or the side

1295
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,280
of the

1296
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:10,600
box so Q is a function of two variables

1297
01:15:08,199 --> 01:15:13,920
that means that as we like to do when we

1298
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:15,719
have functions we take the

1299
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,920
differentials so if I take the

1300
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:20,600
differential of the logarithm of this

1301
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:24,639
summation logar of

1302
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:28,199
q and u it takes a little while but uh

1303
01:15:24,639 --> 01:15:29,960
you can do it that's just uh you can

1304
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:33,600
check

1305
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:37,880
um it can be written this

1306
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:41,480
way so of course it has a DT and a DL

1307
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,480
because the two variables are T and

1308
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:50,520
L uh so once you have done it you may

1309
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:54,080
say um that the coefficient that

1310
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:57,760
multiplies DT is equal to the derivative

1311
01:15:54,080 --> 01:16:01,560
of what you of of of the log of

1312
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:03,679
Q with respect to T and so you obtain

1313
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:06,760
this

1314
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:11,480
relation and this other one is equal to

1315
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:13,800
the derivative of uh uh log of Q with

1316
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:17,040
respect to

1317
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:20,159
L actually notice that if since it's DL

1318
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:22,400
over L this is also you the derivative

1319
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:24,920
of the log of

1320
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:30,520
L so we can so we obtain that the

1321
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:33,360
derivative of log of Q over uh log of L

1322
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:36,639
is equal to e subi over

1323
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:36,639
KT now

1324
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,440
isab

1325
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:48,480
um I don't find it in this slide but it

1326
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:56,719
is is a

1327
01:16:52,920 --> 01:17:00,280
by if you go a couple of slides earlier

1328
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:03,280
you find it and you should correct me if

1329
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:03,280
I'm writing it

1330
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:10,840
wrong isi should be the weighted sum on

1331
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:14,480
the

1332
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:18,880
probabilities of the energy

1333
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:22,159
levels of the single uh

1334
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,159
um uh

1335
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:28,920
Direction so essentially

1336
01:17:25,239 --> 01:17:31,120
it's the uh it's the partial energy see

1337
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:33,400
the the the overall

1338
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:35,800
energy is equal to the sum of the

1339
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:37,960
energies that the particle has in the

1340
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:41,159
three

1341
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:45,800
directions it's like

1342
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:48,199
additive they are independent

1343
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,639
modes independent lives that the

1344
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:53,280
particle has in the three Direction okay

1345
01:17:50,639 --> 01:17:56,159
so here we're watching it just Just One

1346
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:59,080
Direction

1347
01:17:56,159 --> 01:18:04,120
okay then another formula that we

1348
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:07,639
had couple of slides ago is this

1349
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:10,280
one the one that I also wrote uh here

1350
01:18:07,639 --> 01:18:10,280
for the free

1351
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:16,400
energy so if I take the differential of

1352
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:19,239
this

1353
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:21,960
one here is what I

1354
01:18:19,239 --> 01:18:24,920
get again it takes a little bit of doing

1355
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:27,600
because I have to substit I have to take

1356
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:31,360
the differential of log of q but the

1357
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,360
differential of log of Q we just take

1358
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:39,199
it we just took it and so here it is we

1359
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:41,840
substitute it there this one cancels

1360
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:44,320
with one of of the minus one / t^ s that

1361
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:49,520
comes from the derivative of this and so

1362
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:52,360
here is what I'm left with Ds 1 / TDE

1363
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,360
plus something

1364
01:18:53,159 --> 01:18:57,760
DL this is an ropy form of the

1365
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,320
fundamental relation for the stable

1366
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,320
equilibrium

1367
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:06,000
state so this is the Gibbs relation you

1368
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:09,520
like to put it in energy form you just

1369
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:11,239
solve for de and here is it it's de is

1370
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:15,120
minus

1371
01:19:11,239 --> 01:19:15,120
TDS minus something

1372
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:20,880
DL now if

1373
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:29,800
you if you remember

1374
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:33,800
when we have a a sing a substance in the

1375
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:39,440
simple system model

1376
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:41,800
limit uh the Gibbs relation is that de

1377
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:43,320
is TDS minus

1378
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:47,440
pdv

1379
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:49,520
pdv okay volume is the parameter and

1380
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:53,520
pressure is the coefficient in the

1381
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:55,719
differential that measures uh the the

1382
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:59,480
partial of the energy with respect to

1383
01:19:55,719 --> 01:20:02,920
volume at constant s all right so that

1384
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:04,840
prompts Us by just looking at this here

1385
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:06,440
we don't have volume because the volume

1386
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,600
there's no volume for this particle it

1387
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:12,719
is only the length of the Box the size

1388
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:15,000
of the box is the equivalent of the

1389
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:19,239
volume so we can

1390
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,239
Define the equivalent of a

1391
01:20:19,719 --> 01:20:24,719
pressure I will call it don't know what

1392
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,280
name to to give but I will call it

1393
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:27,280
directional

1394
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:31,480
pressure it has dimensions of

1395
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:38,239
pressure and I

1396
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:39,719
say and I Define it uh as the partial

1397
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:42,760
the negative of the partial of the

1398
01:20:39,719 --> 01:20:45,159
energy with respect to

1399
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:49,320
volume but

1400
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:49,320
done while changing

1401
01:20:49,639 --> 01:20:55,360
only the One

1402
01:20:53,239 --> 01:20:58,639
Direction so you see see since I have a

1403
01:20:55,360 --> 01:21:01,000
box now this size this

1404
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:03,360
shape there are three different ways in

1405
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:08,440
which I can change the

1406
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:11,400
volume one is to uh keep L2 and L3 fixed

1407
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:14,040
and make L1

1408
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:17,840
longer and then there are the other

1409
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:19,199
two okay so I'm changing the volume just

1410
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,679
by changing

1411
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:25,679
L1 that's the

1412
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:28,480
pressure assigned to Direction one

1413
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:31,679
how much how much the energy changes in

1414
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:35,840
the stable equilibrium at fixed s fixed

1415
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,840
L2 and L3 when I change

1416
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,880
L1 okay so you can also rewrite it this

1417
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:48,440
way and if you rewrite it this way

1418
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:51,520
because the volume I mean yeah I'll let

1419
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:55,320
you think about this this very

1420
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:58,400
simple um all right so the partial of e

1421
01:21:55,320 --> 01:22:01,400
with respect to the the the logarithm of

1422
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:04,040
L1 is obtained

1423
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:06,159
here because from this

1424
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:09,120
differential this

1425
01:22:06,159 --> 01:22:12,080
coefficient minus 2

1426
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:14,440
e is exactly the partial of e with

1427
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:17,199
respect to the logarithm d l over L is

1428
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:22,280
the logarithm of

1429
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:27,639
L okay so here what we find is that uh

1430
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:27,639
that pressure is two e over

1431
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:38,400
V that is the closest we can get for the

1432
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:40,000
moment without additional assumption so

1433
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:42,560
we found that

1434
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,040
P or

1435
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:48,760
Pi say

1436
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:50,960
one times the

1437
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:58,280
volume is that the

1438
01:22:50,960 --> 01:23:01,520
volume yeah is equal to 2 e

1439
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,520
i Pi

1440
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:12,360
I in a

1441
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:16,840
moment if you add the information that

1442
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:18,840
uh eventually we will have that e subi

1443
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:22,080
is equal to

1444
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,080
one2 of

1445
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:29,080
KT and you substitute up

1446
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:35,880
there you find

1447
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:41,800
that Pi V equals the two cancels equals

1448
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:46,480
KT K remember is the gas constant n r so

1449
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:46,480
you found that Pi V equals

1450
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:54,440
nrt that's the ideal gas equation of

1451
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:57,480
state it requires though this step which

1452
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:59,560
we didn't we don't get yet and it's not

1453
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:03,560
always but but at this stage without

1454
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:04,639
assumptions about uh uh how large the

1455
01:24:03,560 --> 01:24:07,880
temperature

1456
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:11,320
is which is something that we we require

1457
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:14,480
to discuss to get to this result we have

1458
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:18,159
obtained essentially the equivalent the

1459
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:21,520
the equation of state and of course you

1460
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:23,320
have one such uh equation of State for

1461
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:26,440
each

1462
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:29,760
Direction you have you may have energy

1463
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:32,679
in uh in the X Y and Z Direction and so

1464
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:36,639
you have these directional pressures so

1465
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:36,639
you have three such relations

1466
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:54,960
here you also find that the since the

1467
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:57,119
energy sums I mean is additive

1468
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:59,320
the energy of the three directions adds

1469
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:02,080
up to the overall energy of your

1470
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:04,800
particle this relation between energy

1471
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:09,639
and pressures so you can also be written

1472
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,639
as the sum of these three uh

1473
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,639
pressures times V

1474
01:25:17,159 --> 01:25:24,360
/2

1475
01:25:19,719 --> 01:25:26,560
and from the fact that the energy sums I

1476
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,560
can

1477
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:32,400
also uh take the if I take the

1478
01:25:29,639 --> 01:25:32,400
differential of

1479
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:39,679
these so de is equal to the sum of the

1480
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:44,679
DI de I but the expressions for the de I

1481
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:48,719
is is here so the Gibs uh relations for

1482
01:25:44,679 --> 01:25:50,960
the various directions are here I can

1483
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:54,800
sum them up to get the overall Gibs

1484
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:56,960
relation for my particle in the Box and

1485
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:59,360
so I have the equal

1486
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:01,960
TDS and instead of

1487
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:04,159
pdv we have three contributions one for

1488
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,159
each

1489
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:15,320
Direction so this is in general the

1490
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:18,840
gives a relation for the particle in the

1491
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:21,840
box and it has it requires three

1492
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,840
pressures

1493
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:30,560
now we can uh uh make an observation

1494
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:30,560
that

1495
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:35,239
uh the partition

1496
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:41,960
function that we now recognized the the

1497
01:26:39,639 --> 01:26:44,719
role

1498
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:48,520
uh is a

1499
01:26:44,719 --> 01:26:52,920
summation okay so is a

1500
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:56,560
summation of various terms you can

1501
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:56,560
uh think think

1502
01:26:56,840 --> 01:27:00,080
of a

1503
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:03,159
summation

1504
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:10,840
as the various terms consider them as a

1505
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:14,159
the terms in a histogram and then the

1506
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:17,119
summation is the is the area so this is

1507
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:19,560
like the first term like from 0er to one

1508
01:27:17,119 --> 01:27:21,760
and from from here to two and three and

1509
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,760
so

1510
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:28,119
on and so the summation

1511
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:30,800
gives you is essentially the area uh and

1512
01:27:28,119 --> 01:27:32,400
this is the value of the element in the

1513
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:35,639
sum

1514
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:38,840
okay the idea here is that you sometimes

1515
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:42,360
can approximate this

1516
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:46,800
summation as the integral of a

1517
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:50,639
curve and that approximation is

1518
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:55,239
good when the error that you make these

1519
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:57,920
differences here become small

1520
01:27:55,239 --> 01:27:57,920
so this is the

1521
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:05,440
idea it

1522
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:10,239
requires that U this these things be

1523
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:14,280
small uh somehow and that condition is

1524
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:18,679
written here it means that this um

1525
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:21,199
combination of terms must be smaller

1526
01:28:18,679 --> 01:28:24,760
than one this is an

1527
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:29,360
dimensionless uh number which contains

1528
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:32,719
temperature and the square of the side

1529
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:35,360
and it has to be small if this is

1530
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:37,760
small you can approximate the summation

1531
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:40,679
with an integral and then this is a kind

1532
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:43,560
of integral that can be done because

1533
01:28:40,679 --> 01:28:47,199
it's an integral from 0 to

1534
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:47,199
infinity and here is the

1535
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:55,320
result and this is the partition

1536
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,520
function for One Direction if you

1537
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:59,960
multiply the partition functions for the

1538
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,960
various

1539
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:06,440
directions uh so you must multiply the

1540
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:08,520
three you get the partition function for

1541
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:12,000
the overall particle in the

1542
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:12,000
box and

1543
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:22,320
uh you see here I have L uh

1544
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:24,600
I it's

1545
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:27,280
squared uh but actually

1546
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:28,400
it's to the 1/2 so you can take it

1547
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,920
outside

1548
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:35,080
also and when you multiply the three of

1549
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:36,199
them it becomes L1 * L2 * L3 which is

1550
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:38,239
the

1551
01:29:36,199 --> 01:29:40,880
volume of the

1552
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:42,520
box and so the partition function also

1553
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:45,560
here is a q to the

1554
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:48,679
2/3 but it's to the three halfes so you

1555
01:29:45,560 --> 01:29:51,199
can take the V outside so essentially

1556
01:29:48,679 --> 01:29:56,040
this says that the overall partition

1557
01:29:51,199 --> 01:30:00,000
function depends on the volume

1558
01:29:56,040 --> 01:30:03,760
only essentially in this limit you are

1559
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:06,679
uh losing the um

1560
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:08,800
effect of the details of the shape of

1561
01:30:06,679 --> 01:30:12,520
the Box what

1562
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:14,960
counts is just the product of the three

1563
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:14,960
which is the

1564
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:24,520
volume uh in

1565
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:26,560
fact in that limit

1566
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:30,679
uh if you if you take the formulas we

1567
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:34,520
have up up here for say for the energy e

1568
01:30:30,679 --> 01:30:36,159
subi you have to take uh the log the

1569
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:40,560
partial of the logarithm with respect to

1570
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:42,880
T well here is Q take the

1571
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:47,199
logarithm with respect to

1572
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:50,600
T it's just 12 time

1573
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:50,600
KT that's the

1574
01:30:50,679 --> 01:30:57,000
result and

1575
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:59,880
therefore and is equal in all directions

1576
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:03,639
this is so-called equip

1577
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:05,360
partition theorem uh

1578
01:31:03,639 --> 01:31:10,159
the

1579
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:12,560
uh the particle has decided in this

1580
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:16,199
limit to

1581
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:19,400
distribute equally the energy in the

1582
01:31:16,199 --> 01:31:25,520
three translational

1583
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:25,520
modes and each one gets a half of KT

1584
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:30,000
meaning that since the energy of the

1585
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:33,400
particle is the sum of the energies of

1586
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:38,920
the three

1587
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:38,920
directions e is equal to three halves of

1588
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:47,520
KT this a structureless

1589
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:49,000
particle and the so the specific heat

1590
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,800
which is the partial of e with respect

1591
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:55,840
to T is

1592
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:55,840
three2 K of the bement constant

1593
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:05,239
also these pressures become all uh equal

1594
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,239
to one

1595
01:32:07,119 --> 01:32:15,440
another so if I take the Gibs relation

1596
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:20,880
and these pies are equal to one

1597
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:25,639
another uh I can write it this

1598
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:27,239
way and uh so I get uh uh so these three

1599
01:32:25,639 --> 01:32:31,920
terms becomes

1600
01:32:27,239 --> 01:32:35,639
KT which is here times the sum of the L

1601
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:37,520
over L this is the sum of the log of the

1602
01:32:35,639 --> 01:32:43,080
of the logarithms so the it's the

1603
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:47,719
derivative of uh the volume over the

1604
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:47,719
volume it's D of log of

1605
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:54,920
v and so we have the GI

1606
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:57,800
relation but now if if we take the G

1607
01:32:54,920 --> 01:33:01,159
relation and uh remember that what

1608
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:04,080
multiplies DV is what we call

1609
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:06,960
pressure here we find that therefore the

1610
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:11,840
pressure of the particle in the box is

1611
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:16,000
KT over V so we get PV is equal

1612
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:16,000
KT which is theal gas

1613
01:33:17,159 --> 01:33:23,119
law we also get of course the expression

1614
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:23,119
for the entropy

1615
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:27,719
which is a function of temperature which

1616
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:29,760
can be written as a function of

1617
01:33:27,719 --> 01:33:33,600
temperature and volume

1618
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:36,280
only so we lost uh the information about

1619
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:39,920
the need to uh know the details of the

1620
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:43,080
box so that means that in that limit and

1621
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:46,520
this limit uh this condition that this

1622
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:50,360
is small can also be uh written this

1623
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:52,520
way that the temperature if you fix the

1624
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:54,280
volume it means that the temperature

1625
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:56,440
must be

1626
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:59,119
big enough so

1627
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:01,639
that these constants divided by the

1628
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:01,639
volume to the

1629
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:09,639
2/3 uh so that the temperature is much

1630
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:09,639
greater than this

1631
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:17,760
number or you could also put it

1632
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:20,040
differently if you fix the temperature

1633
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:25,719
you need the volume to be big

1634
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:28,560
enough the system must be diluted enough

1635
01:34:25,719 --> 01:34:28,560
so in these

1636
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:35,800
limits

1637
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:38,679
um we find the ideal gas law and we find

1638
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:41,719
uh that

1639
01:34:38,679 --> 01:34:45,119
the box of the same

1640
01:34:41,719 --> 01:34:48,119
volume uh it could be very many

1641
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:51,280
different shapes have uh can have the

1642
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:55,600
same volume they all have the same

1643
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:55,600
properties that's why

1644
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:01,560
uh in most practical situations this uh

1645
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:06,040
uh since this is

1646
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:08,600
satisfied except when you go to very low

1647
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:10,119
temperatures that's why we typically use

1648
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:11,880
just the volume as

1649
01:35:10,119 --> 01:35:14,000
parameter because otherwise you would

1650
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:15,480
say all right you said the beginning you

1651
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,199
need to put the parameters in the

1652
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:19,199
fundamental relation but then you end up

1653
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:22,760
always putting only volume why well

1654
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:25,440
here's the reason because for most

1655
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:28,080
practical situation but not for small

1656
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:32,000
systems

1657
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:32,000
uh volume is all that

1658
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:40,719
counts

1659
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:43,480
okay so

1660
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:47,280
uh just a couple of

1661
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:51,000
minutes uh we are left uh I want to

1662
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:55,040
introduce this idea which is going to be

1663
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,040
our next step

1664
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:04,239
remember that we talked

1665
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:07,480
about the gas uh

1666
01:36:04,239 --> 01:36:09,639
State uh as one in which the particles

1667
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:14,920
spend most of their times distant from

1668
01:36:09,639 --> 01:36:14,920
one another in spite of their colliding

1669
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:20,320
okay

1670
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:26,080
uh so in

1671
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,320
the ideal

1672
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:30,760
gas Gibbs Dalton

1673
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:33,679
mixture of Ideal

1674
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:35,960
gases we found that essentially the

1675
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:39,960
particles live in the space without

1676
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:39,960
seeing each other except when they

1677
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:49,360
Collide and

1678
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:55,320
uh and that results to the

1679
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:55,320
fact that the entropy of mixing

1680
01:36:55,840 --> 01:37:02,080
is the only

1681
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:04,600
effect uh that results upon mixing you

1682
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:08,719
mix

1683
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:11,840
gases at given uh the spontaneous

1684
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:14,719
process the temperature doesn't change

1685
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:14,719
the pressure doesn't

1686
01:37:15,199 --> 01:37:23,199
change and the only thing that changes

1687
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,199
is the entropy is the mixing uh

1688
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:31,600
now we need

1689
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:35,480
to Define also an ideal behavior for

1690
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:38,000
liquid phase now in liquid phase the

1691
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:41,560
particles do see each other actually

1692
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:44,040
they live most of the times close to one

1693
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:49,960
another so close

1694
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:49,960
to uh where this um um

1695
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:59,400
intermolecular potential has a min

1696
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:59,400
so for them that is

1697
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:05,320
important

1698
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:09,679
however we're going to Define an ideal

1699
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:09,679
solution Behavior one in

1700
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:16,360
which uh the

1701
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:19,639
curves for the interaction

1702
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:24,239
between uh equal

1703
01:38:19,639 --> 01:38:26,159
particles or different particles are all

1704
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:29,920
very

1705
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:33,320
similar so if they are all very

1706
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:34,760
similar the particle doesn't care what

1707
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:37,760
the neighbor

1708
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:41,199
is okay in this

1709
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:45,280
limit again when you mix

1710
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:48,679
stuff the only effect you don't get any

1711
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:50,599
energy of mixing or enthalpy of mixing

1712
01:38:48,679 --> 01:38:53,760
you don't get any change of volume of

1713
01:38:50,599 --> 01:38:56,360
mixing because the particle doesn't want

1714
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:57,639
to change their preferred distances

1715
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:02,159
which would

1716
01:38:57,639 --> 01:39:04,599
imply enthalpy of mixing or uh volume of

1717
01:39:02,159 --> 01:39:05,960
mixing which would imply uh stay

1718
01:39:04,599 --> 01:39:10,360
changing the

1719
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:13,480
distance because essentially they

1720
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:17,000
uh they like each other in the same

1721
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:21,599
way uh the

1722
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:23,880
only effect upon mixing is the

1723
01:39:21,599 --> 01:39:25,800
randomness so the entropy

1724
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:29,480
mixing

1725
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:31,960
okay and therefore in this model that we

1726
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:34,880
Define uh we will assume that the

1727
01:39:31,960 --> 01:39:37,400
entropy of mixing of the single particle

1728
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:41,960
is related to the

1729
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:45,080
surprise uh and that is the only effect

1730
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:45,880
of this ideal situation that we're going

1731
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:47,560
to

1732
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:51,639
Define

1733
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:55,320
okay so with that we set the ground for

1734
01:39:51,639 --> 01:39:55,320
the next uh lecture
