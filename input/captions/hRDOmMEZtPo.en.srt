1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:19,119
okay can people hear in the back are we

2
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:21,400
good yeah thumbs up okay nice one so uh

3
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,160
you you've already seen uh a couple of

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,599
lectures on on number Theory now and uh

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,560
so we've already uh some of you have

6
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,279
been asking like why are we doing this

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,399
why is this in

8
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,800
61200 and uh today we're going to see

9
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,640
how gcds and modular arithmetic uh can

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,160
be very important for uh you know

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,239
something that you that you use every

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,120
day computer security uh so cryptography

13
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,640
has been uh uh you know very important

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,520
uh subject for you know uh for for daily

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:58,160
life for like the last 20 odd years uh

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,680
you know any time you uh do an online uh

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,680
like credit card transaction or anything

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,920
like that like that's using uh you know

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,760
modern

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,360
cryptography um we'll see some uh some

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,960
examples from history where it was quite

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,240
important uh it's it's you know very

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,799
much a computer science topic not uh not

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,640
just math and uh but but it does use all

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,119
sorts of uh exciting mathematics

26
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,880
including you know number Theory okay so

27
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:28,040
can anybody tell me you know just in a

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,040
nutshell very informally uh what is

29
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,920
cryptography anyone

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,600
yep okay secure information over an

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,680
insecure Channel yeah that's a that's a

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,840
pretty good

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,119
description uh so I I would say that

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,520
it's uh you know the art or science of

35
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,119
of you know dealing with with such uh

36
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,680
dealing with protecting

37
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,680
information

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,039
um so like the the basic idea right uh

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,320
well at least for for what we're going

40
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,640
to be looking at today is suppose you

41
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,760
have an insecure Channel and you want to

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,680
send some message to uh you know a

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,519
recipient but you don't want other

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,720
people who might be uh EES dropping on

45
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,239
your channel to to know what you're

46
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,800
doing okay so basically you're going to

47
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,440
want to garble a a message that you send

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,519
privately in such a way that only

49
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,920
certain parties can read it okay so

50
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,840
let's uh you know take a look at at uh

51
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,840
what we mean

52
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:41,560
okay so the art or science of protecting

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,040
information so our uh you know our setup

54
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,800
the convention right is that we're going

55
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,400
to have uh two parties Alis Kazam and

56
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,519
and

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,599
Bulbasaur and they're going to be trying

58
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,560
to communicate over this communication

59
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,599
Channel which you know may or may not be

60
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,800
secure okay so maybe Alis Kazam wants to

61
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,760
send a message it's it's Pi Day so she's

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,440
going to send a pi

63
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,680
uh over to Bulbasaur right so you know

64
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,840
maybe she puts it in an envelope uh pops

65
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,400
it in the post and you know Bulbasaur

66
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,720
receives it he can open up the envelope

67
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,040
and and get the message okay so does

68
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:20,080
that basic setup make sense to

69
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,440
people okay so nothing too fancy yet uh

70
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,239
but what could go

71
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,400
wrong can anybody uh tell me a problem

72
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,400
with

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
this yeah

74
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,080
yeah somebody could come and steal the

75
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,879
message right so like maybe we've got uh

76
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:42,040
some Eve stopper Eevee right and uh you

77
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,400
know Eevee wants to uh wants to Eve St

78
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,080
up on their conversation wants to figure

79
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,720
out what they're talking about okay so

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,360
it's it's quite possible that you know

81
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,079
maybe Alex Alex Kazam pops this in the

82
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,439
mail Eevee then opens the mail puts it

83
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,799
back in the mail sends it along to

84
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,480
bobasaur but now Eevee knows what the

85
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:03,680
message is okay so this is a problem

86
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,680
right what else could go wrong any other

87
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,799
ideas

88
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,720
yeah yeah like what if what if Eevee is

89
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,560
is not just an eavesdropper but like

90
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,280
some meddling adversary okay so you know

91
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,759
maybe maybe Bulbasaur now wants to say

92
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,280
thank you for the pie Bulbasaur you know

93
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:32,199
puts this in an envelope sends it over

94
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,320
to all gam but you know E's intercepted

95
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,400
along the way and so now when uh when

96
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,320
alexam gets it it's not quite the same

97
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,759
message as Bulbasaur sent okay so that's

98
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,039
also a problem we we'd also like to

99
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,840
prevent this

100
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:49,639
okay so what can we

101
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,800
do well if we think about you know the

102
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,360
actual Postal System we could uh you

103
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,120
know basically put a put a seal on it

104
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,120
like a an oldfashioned Wax Seal uh but

105
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,639
you know basically

106
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,479
Alice gazam and Bulbasaur are going to

107
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,720
share some some key okay

108
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,639
so they they have a a message that

109
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,919
they'd like to share it's supposed to be

110
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,080
secret so instead of just you know

111
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,280
putting the envelope in the post they're

112
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,319
going to put it in a locked box right

113
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,120
and alas exam will will lock it with her

114
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,199
key and now when she sends it over the

115
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,199
channel Eevee can't do anything with it

116
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,560
it's locked Eevee doesn't have the key

117
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,360
okay but Bulbasaur has the same key so

118
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,680
he can now remove the lock and open the

119
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,680
message and everything is awesome

120
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,479
okay so key Concepts in

121
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:46,840
cryptography oops that all

122
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:48,560
work okay so the the basic idea you know

123
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,080
we're we're trying to send private

124
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,319
messages right so we're going to want to

125
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,440
what we call encrypt a message so this

126
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,960
means just garbling it so it kind of

127
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,840
looks like random

128
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,120
noise uh so only parties who share your

129
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,800
secret key will be able to read

130
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,759
it

131
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,720
okay uh decryption is the reverse right

132
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:09,840
you're going to take one of these

133
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,000
garbled messages if you're the intended

134
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,039
recipient and hopefully you can Ungar it

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,520
to recover the uh the original message

136
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:21,240
but also you know hopefully nobody else

137
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,919
can do the same thing okay and in order

138
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,919
to do both of these things uh the the

139
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,319
two parties are going to share a secret

140
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,080
key which is some data that that only

141
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,520
they have nobody else should have it and

142
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,560
it should look random and it should be

143
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,720
hard for for somebody else to to derive

144
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,720
or guess

145
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,000
yeah that's a great question so like

146
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,240
that yeah they have to meet up and and

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,680
actually share a key uh but then that

148
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,759
allows them to you know share messages

149
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,120
uh over this insecure Channel later okay

150
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,919
but they they do have to establish a uh

151
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,759
you know a secure way of sharing the key

152
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,840
first uh so we won't be talking too much

153
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,840
about how you can actually do that

154
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,240
nowadays uh but it is in the notes if

155
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,199
you'd like to read it

156
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,199
okay

157
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:20,000
uh okay so a cryptographic scheme is

158
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,360
basically just you know these things

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,879
right it's a it's an encryption

160
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,160
algorithm paired with a decryption

161
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,360
algorithm and they should you know use

162
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,840
the same secret key to uh you know

163
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,840
invert each other

164
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,879
okay so can anybody give me examples

165
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,960
historical examples of cryptographic

166
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,240
schemes does anybody know what the first

167
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,240
one

168
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,400
was

169
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,800
yeah uh yeah the Caesar

170
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,800
Cipher so what was the Caesar

171
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,520
Cipher how do you encrypt a message yeah

172
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,479
okay so the answer was you offset every

173
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:07,720
message in the letter by you know n

174
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,720
letters after

175
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,240
it uh not quite you are thinking of

176
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,759
something very slightly different the

177
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,919
Caesar Cipher was specifically using

178
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:22,639
three not not like some some key n okay

179
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,120
so you take every letter shift it over

180
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:29,800
by three letters so like you know C

181
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,960
becomes D EF right uh and you know you

182
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,760
shift every letter uh individually and

183
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,959
then send the shifted message okay and

184
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,159
to decrypt it you do the reverse you you

185
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,640
kind of subtract three modul

186
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:45,399
26 okay does that make sense to

187
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,959
everybody now what you're thinking of is

188
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:51,680
the Caesar

189
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:53,360
shift which is slightly better right so

190
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,360
one problem with the Caesar Cipher right

191
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:00,079
is um you know you're not you don't

192
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,640
really have a key right like uh

193
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:05,839
it's kind of what we call cryptography

194
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,839
by obscurity so the only reason it might

195
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,200
be secure is if nobody else knows you're

196
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,880
doing

197
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:17,000
it uh unfortunately you know if uh you

198
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,040
know if you're a Roman Emperor Legion or

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,760
whatever using the Caesar

200
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,560
Cipher

201
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:27,079
uh you know it doesn't protect against

202
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,600
say maybe one of your generals defects

203
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:31,120
and uh now goes to the enemy and is like

204
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,760
hey they're using this cryptographic

205
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,560
scheme here's how you can break all

206
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,040
their messages right and so then from

207
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,760
that point forward you know nothing you

208
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,839
send is secure okay so one way we can

209
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,839
fix that is you know by as you said

210
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:49,279
introducing a key okay so the Caesar

211
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,040
shift is you know very similar but

212
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,760
instead of just shifting by three you

213
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,880
shift by you know some secret key K okay

214
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,320
modulo

215
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,320
26 okay does anybody see a problem with

216
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,320
this

217
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:12,200
MH yeah that it is

218
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,200
so oops let's not caps lock

219
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:21,160
that

220
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:25,519
uh okay so here is a um oh

221
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,519
that did not work what is going

222
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,399
on okay so here's uh an encrypted

223
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,560
message it's been encrypt encrypted

224
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,720
using the uh uh the Caesar Cipher sorry

225
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,720
Caesar

226
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,639
shift

227
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,639
uh as you said right it's fairly easy to

228
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,279
guess what the key is right so does

229
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,519
anybody have any guesses before I start

230
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,639
just you know putting in

231
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,560
values

232
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,560
yeah 13 why 13

233
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,320
yeah that's uh that's a very good

234
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,040
guess so yeah no knowing some

235
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,399
information about the message right like

236
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,760
this is probably in English right uh you

237
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,600
have a a standalone n in that first line

238
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,200
right that's probably an A or an I right

239
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,440
you you've already got lots of

240
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,880
information that you can use to narrow

241
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,480
down the key and even if you don't right

242
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,200
like if we just start putting in random

243
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,240
values here right like most of them are

244
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,240
going to look like garbage right

245
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,600
okay uh but like one of them is actually

246
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,279
going to make sense okay so when we try

247
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,360
all of the possible values we're going

248
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,920
to you know figure out something that uh

249
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,839
that is almost certainly going to be the

250
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:49,120
the correct key

251
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:52,320
okay so how can we avoid this

252
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,320
problem any

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
ideas yeah

254
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,040
change the encryption method based on

255
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,839
the index of the letter okay uh so what

256
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,760
you're describing is uh what we call the

257
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:13,839
onetime pad um that is a good idea we

258
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,839
will not be covering it just yet

259
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,600
yeah okay um similar idea uh let's let's

260
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,560
start by making a a smaller more

261
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,880
incremental change

262
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,160
yeah okay include

263
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,079
numbers uh

264
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,839
well the idea that I had in mind was to

265
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,600
just use a larger key

266
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,320
space uh use a permutation instead of

267
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,560
instead of just a shift okay so that

268
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,199
this is something that was done you know

269
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,199
in medieval times uh instead of Shifting

270
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:49,680
every letter over by the same amount

271
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:51,079
right you'd take a random permutation of

272
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,959
the letters and so you're kind of

273
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:56,560
Shifting each letter

274
00:12:52,959 --> 00:13:00,240
differently okay now can anybody think

275
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:03,680
of a way that you could attack this

276
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,680
oh why is this not

277
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:12,120
working

278
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,120
H sorry technical

279
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:20,440
difficulties oh well I guess it doesn't

280
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,279
matter too much uh I can describe what's

281
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,519
going on um so yeah uh what what your

282
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,720
classmate suggested was that you know

283
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,639
again we can use uh the known plain text

284
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,160
attack that that we described a moment

285
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:37,399
ago with the um uh with the Caesar shift

286
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,399
okay if we know something about uh about

287
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,240
our message right like uh for instance

288
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,360
if we know that it's it's probably

289
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,199
written in

290
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:51,079
English then we can count how many times

291
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:53,160
each letter appears and whichever letter

292
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:55,800
appears most frequently probably

293
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,040
decrypts to e because e is the uh most

294
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,399
common English letter or even if not

295
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,600
we've got a decent guess right like uh

296
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,120
you know it's probably not going to be

297
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,320
like X or Zed it might be S or t or

298
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,880
something like that uh but the point is

299
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,199
it's very easy to start narrowing down

300
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,839
the key

301
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,519
space and you know once we have a guess

302
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,079
we can then start building on it so

303
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,839
similarly to what your colleague did

304
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,240
earlier right like if you have e and you

305
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:25,120
see threel words you know ending with E

306
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,079
that might be the right so then you've

307
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,839
got two more letters okay does that make

308
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,639
sense to people so you can like knowing

309
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,600
a little bit of of information about

310
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,320
your key you can kind of incrementally

311
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,440
figure out the the rest of the key and

312
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,440
decrypt the message

313
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,160
yeah that's right so it is a permutation

314
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,720
so uh you know it's a it's a onetoone

315
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:58,360
map it's a

316
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,360
bje okay uh other questions

317
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,480
maybe I can just post this demo on the

318
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:08,720
website so you can uh play around with

319
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,839
it uh sorry it didn't

320
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,839
work

321
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
um

322
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:19,079
okay so the next example comes from

323
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,800
World War II has anybody uh heard of the

324
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:25,399
Enigma Cipher yeah few hands can anybody

325
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,399
tell me what it

326
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,959
did mhm

327
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,360
okay uh so the answer was it changed the

328
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,480
encryption method every day uh that's

329
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,519
not quite true it changed the key every

330
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,240
day it didn't change the algorithm that

331
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,240
they were using uh

332
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,040
yes yeah so it it basically oh so the

333
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,480
answer was it it changed the permutation

334
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,839
every letter uh so yes that's that's the

335
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,000
the basic idea behind uh

336
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:01,519
Enigma um it started with some you know

337
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,519
permutation of the letters and every

338
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,319
time you uh encrypted a letter it would

339
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,440
then you know apply some some uh change

340
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:11,519
to this permutation so that the next

341
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,360
letter would be encrypted differently so

342
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,519
that made it resistant to a frequency

343
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:21,120
analysis um but you know unfortunately

344
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:24,000
for the for the Germans it was still

345
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,440
viable to do a known plain text attack

346
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,399
right so basically the the way that the

347
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,480
Allies ended up breaking this uh

348
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,839
encryption scheme was you know they knew

349
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,759
something about uh about the messages

350
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,040
that were being sent every day right

351
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:39,800
like many of them were weather reports

352
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,279
or

353
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,800
something uh many of them had like you

354
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,199
know the phrase H Hitler or something

355
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,519
like that um but like if you know that

356
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:50,199
you're getting a weather report from a

357
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:52,000
certain location you know the weather in

358
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:54,040
that location like you've got a bunch of

359
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,800
information about what you know how this

360
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,959
message might start right and so this

361
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,199
you know similarly to to to a a

362
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:04,839
frequency analysis attack you can kind

363
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:07,400
of use this information to narrow down

364
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,199
your key space and uh figure out the

365
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,640
secret key and once you've got that you

366
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,039
can decrypt everything that's being sent

367
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,799
that day uh and so you know this is what

368
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:20,439
the Allies were were doing uh uh in

369
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:22,120
Bletchley Park to to win the war

370
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,919
okay

371
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:29,400
so Enigma kind

372
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:31,799
of uh Enigma was kind of the the last

373
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,919
uh major example of of what

374
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:39,080
we or what I call kind of um

375
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,480
cryptography by hubis uh like basically

376
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,520
the the security relied on on you know

377
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,679
some German engineer being you know

378
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,400
smarter than everybody else on the

379
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:50,640
planet right like you know he he came up

380
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,160
with this uh encryption scheme and was

381
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,480
like okay this looks uh this looks you

382
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,960
know weird and random I can't figure out

383
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,760
how to break it I bet nobody else can

384
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,440
either okay and so the the Germans kind

385
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,919
of worked with this assumption for the

386
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:10,679
uh duration of the war and it was wrong

387
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:13,360
right so nowadays we like to uh you know

388
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,559
try and you know prove Security based on

389
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,440
you know more reasonable assumptions

390
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,919
than

391
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,760
that so uh one example which is in the

392
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:24,000
notes that we won't be uh covering too

393
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,720
much today is uh called Diffy Helman uh

394
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,960
the one that we'll be focusing on though

395
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,000
is uh RSA

396
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,640
so RSA was uh you know it's it's a a

397
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,559
modern cryptographic scheme named after

398
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:42,120
its inventor Clifford

399
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:43,960
Cox um that's totally a lie uh so

400
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,400
Clifford Cox did you know in some sense

401
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,760
invent RSA but uh he made the rather

402
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,480
suspicious life choice of working for

403
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,159
the

404
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,400
government uh so his work was classified

405
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:56,720
for like 2025 years something like that

406
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,080
and in the meantime you know rsna came

407
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,559
along uh and you know Ed his same scheme

408
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,280
they did it here at

409
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:08,120
MIT uh so this was uh Ron reest Addie

410
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,360
Shir and Leonard Adelman uh they got all

411
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,360
the credit for it they won a cheering

412
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,039
award and you know poor Mr Cox uh was

413
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,200
kind of screwed um so more of the story

414
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,679
don't work for the government um just

415
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:25,720
kidding but uh yeah kind of sucked for

416
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:28,559
him uh but yeah let's uh why don't we um

417
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,559
why don't we get into uh to what RSA

418
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,799
actually actually does

419
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,280
okay so RSA is an example of what we

420
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,600
call a public key crypto

421
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,600
system

422
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,600
okay

423
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:02,720
so okay so before right I described uh

424
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,679
what we actually call a a a private key

425
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,480
crypto system right where both

426
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:12,039
encryption and decryption use the same

427
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,679
secret key okay in a public key crypto

428
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:17,360
system that's no longer the case so we

429
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,360
actually have two

430
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:29,880
keys so let's call them uh KP and

431
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:34,280
KS okay so KP is going to be a public

432
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:36,320
key which everybody can see okay and

433
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,400
then it's going to be paired with the

434
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:43,280
secret key KS which you know you keep to

435
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,360
yourself okay and now the encryption and

436
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,280
decryption

437
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:50,720
algorithms uh each of them uses a

438
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:53,720
different key Okay so we've got

439
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,720
uh

440
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,280
encryption okay so our encryption

441
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,240
algorithm

442
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,799
is going to be you know e of some

443
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,559
message and our public

444
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:09,760
key okay and this will output you know

445
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,760
some Cipher text

446
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,600
C okay and then we're going to have a

447
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,600
different decryption

448
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,760
algorithm D which will you know

449
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,880
hopefully take this Cipher text uh C and

450
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,919
this time the secret

451
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,559
key and it should output the original

452
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,279
plane text message

453
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:41,240
M

454
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:43,919
okay so slightly different from the uh

455
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,520
uh uh from the the crypto system that I

456
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,200
defined earlier right in that one these

457
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,480
two keys were the same and so you don't

458
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:54,159
you you can't publish uh you can't

459
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,080
publish KP okay so only people who share

460
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,240
the same secret key can actually

461
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:03,279
communicate here this allows you know

462
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:05,279
any body to uh to to send a message okay

463
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,400
so you can kind of think of this as you

464
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,880
know suppose Alex exam wants to send a

465
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,039
message to

466
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,279
Bulbasaur uh so she's going to use

467
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,600
Bulbasaur's public key to send him a

468
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,360
message you can think of this as

469
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,840
Bulbasaur's like Gmail address right

470
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,799
this is something that you know anybody

471
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,240
can

472
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,600
find uh but then Bulbasaur has his Gmail

473
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,159
password which he can then use to read

474
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,159
the message okay

475
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,320
okay

476
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:42,760
so now we are ready

477
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,760
to actually Define how RSA

478
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:53,000
works

479
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:57,120
okay so the basic idea behind

480
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,120
RSA is that uh the encryption and

481
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,679
decryption algorithm together

482
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,919
uh should basically make use of phos

483
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:07,120
little theorem to to make sure that we

484
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,559
get back to the same

485
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,320
message okay

486
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:20,480
so we're going to try and come up with

487
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:25,520
uh you know some e and d

488
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,520
right and some n such that if we you

489
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,520
know

490
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,400
exponentiate right first raised to the

491
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,559
power of of uh e then raise again to the

492
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,720
power of D we should get back to to

493
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:42,000
where we started okay so we're going to

494
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:44,240
want uh you know for any m m to the E

495
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,679
raised to the power of D should be

496
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,480
equivalent mod n to

497
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,600
n

498
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,440
okay so let let's just start with

499
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,320
correctness for now let's let's not

500
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,679
worry too much about security just yet

501
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:05,200
but uh how could we achieve

502
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:07,279
this how could we choose uh n and D such

503
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,679
that this will at least work even if

504
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,679
it's not

505
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,720
secure any

506
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,279
ideas so what what did FMA tell

507
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:41,279
us so phma tells

508
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:46,559
us right that uh m to

509
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:51,039
the uh you know P minus one is congruent

510
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,039
mod P to one

511
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:01,000
okay so how can we kind of massage this

512
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,000
into

513
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:19,120
this well first time might we choose

514
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,120
n

515
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,559
yeah

516
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,600
sorry

517
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:32,200
okay

518
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:35,360
so the idea was to you know let e and d

519
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:38,919
uh be factors of n so like e *

520
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,919
D sorry equals

521
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:41,919
n

522
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,399
okay uh does anybody see a problem with

523
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:48,399
this

524
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:55,159
yeah uh so that's not the problem right

525
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,640
so we uh remember the exponent here is p

526
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:00,279
minus one right so you know if you

527
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:04,520
multiply both Ides by m you get m to the

528
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:06,200
p is congruent mod P to M okay so that

529
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,760
that is actually what we

530
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,520
want what assumption did we have on

531
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,520
P

532
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,399
yeah P ISE yeah p is prime so we can't

533
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,399
do

534
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:20,399
this

535
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,640
okay it is close though

536
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:37,880
so maybe I should rewrite this as the

537
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,960
suggestion was e * D should be equal to

538
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:42,240
p

539
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,240
minus1 +

540
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,240
1

541
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,600
okay does that make it any more clear

542
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,600
what how we can uh iterate on this

543
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,720
what other things would work here

544
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,720
instead of P minus one +

545
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,159
one yeah

546
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:37,000
yeah uh yes that's right

547
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:40,320
sorry so the answer was we can multiply

548
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,880
this by whatever we want right like any

549
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:49,840
K here it'll still work right as long as

550
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:55,600
e * D is equivalent to 1 mod P minus one

551
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:58,640
so e d equivalent mod P minus one to 1

552
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,960
right as long as we satisfy this

553
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:06,039
right we get

554
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:09,440
this okay or sorry we get

555
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:09,440
this okay

556
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,679
yeah uh so the the the question was like

557
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,960
what are we multiplying by K we're

558
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:24,760
multiplying this P minus one right uh

559
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,760
yeah so the the reason right FLT says

560
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:30,640
that M the P minus one is congruent to

561
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,799
one so m to the K * P minus one is going

562
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,720
to be 1 to the K right so that's just

563
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:38,320
one okay so no matter what K we put here

564
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,919
this will still work now when you

565
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,240
multiply by m that's just adding one

566
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:47,640
onto the exponents okay so then you'll

567
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:49,480
have you know m to the uh K * P - 1 + 1

568
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,039
should be congruent to to

569
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:56,120
n

570
00:28:52,039 --> 00:29:00,039
okay does this setup make sense to

571
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:00,039
people yeah

572
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,720
question uh so the the question was why

573
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,600
are we adding one onto the end so the

574
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,720
answer was you know FLT tells us that

575
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,399
we're going to get one what we really

576
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,919
wanted was

577
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:18,679
n okay so you know what what we want is

578
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,960
uh you know m to the Ed is congruent to

579
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:26,000
m not congruent to one so that's why

580
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,720
okay so as long as we choose Ed

581
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,679
congruent mod P minus one to one

582
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,679
right we'll get

583
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:40,480
this okay so you know more practically

584
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,480
speaking how can we generate e and

585
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:01,640
D like how can I find uh a solution

586
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,640
to this uh

587
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,320
congruence

588
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,320
yeah

589
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,000
sorry okay so the answer was TR

590
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,330
different values of

591
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,159
K uh okay

592
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,320
[Music]

593
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:26,200
so we're going to want to be using very

594
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,120
large numbers here so that's going to be

595
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,360
intractable we want to be able to do

596
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,360
more

597
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,440
efficiently so recall from uh Tuesday

598
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:46,440
right this is saying that e and D are

599
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:51,240
modular inverses modu P minus

600
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:54,519
one okay how can we compute a modular

601
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:59,919
inverse well one way is to use the

602
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:59,919
pulverizer okay so if we choose e

603
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,360
randomly and then

604
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:18,399
pulverize this will give us

605
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:18,399
D

606
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,960
Okay Okay so we've got a way to generate

607
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,440
Keys we've got a way to encrypt we raise

608
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,039
m to the E we've got a way to decrypt we

609
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,279
raise C to the

610
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:35,760
D can anybody tell me a security

611
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:35,760
flow why is this

612
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:52,760
insecure so remember for public key

613
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,760
crypto system right everybody knows the

614
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:59,120
public

615
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,799
key right and we don't want anybody to

616
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,240
be able to figure out the private key

617
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,480
from

618
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:09,600
that so in this case our public key is

619
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:16,240
going to be you know KP is going to be

620
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:21,200
the pair uh P comma D oh

621
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:24,120
sorry P comma e and our secret key is

622
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,320
going to be the P the pair P comma

623
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,840
D okay so this is what we need in order

624
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,960
to encrypt this is what we need in order

625
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,960
to

626
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,440
decrypt I claim that this is

627
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,080
insecure

628
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,720
yeah yes so the answer was can't anybody

629
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:51,480
else do exactly what we did right we

630
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,840
started with the public

631
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,960
key and then use it to to derive our our

632
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,639
secret

633
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,440
key if we then share that public key

634
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:03,240
with everybody else everybody else can

635
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,480
do exactly the same thing okay so our

636
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,480
secret key isn't exactly

637
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,440
secret

638
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,480
okay so we would like to try and do

639
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,200
something similar to this but in a way

640
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,440
where other people can't you know repeat

641
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,440
our

642
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,200
computation can anybody think of how we

643
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:25,200
might do this

644
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,760
how can I make sure that nobody else can

645
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,760
do the same

646
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:45,279
pulverization

647
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:52,399
yeah okay so the answer was choose a

648
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:54,679
random D and then pulverize to find E I

649
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:58,440
claim that this is exactly the same

650
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:59,960
right it's it's the same process right

651
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,440
um

652
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:07,000
so you know like these two are basically

653
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,320
symmetric okay so like if I share one of

654
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,480
them then anybody else can can then find

655
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,480
the

656
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:30,760
other okay so the idea behind RSA right

657
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:33,159
is that this modulus here the the thing

658
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,599
that we're trying to pulverize with

659
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:38,960
right and

660
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,040
the modulus here the part of the key

661
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,440
that we're

662
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:47,520
sharing you know here they're off by

663
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:51,399
one but in some sense they don't have to

664
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,760
be okay so we'd like to find a way to

665
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:56,320
share

666
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:59,640
this but like not have this be so easily

667
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,640
uh so easily computable

668
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,839
okay how could we do

669
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,599
that well instead of using a single

670
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,599
Prime suppose we have two

671
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,280
primes so let's call them p and

672
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,960
Q

673
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,240
okay and

674
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:46,119
now uh our

675
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:48,200
n is going to be their product P * Q

676
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:50,640
okay so that's going to be what I want

677
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,640
to share

678
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:04,640
here okay

679
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,640
uh but now this no longer quite

680
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:14,440
works so instead of pulverizing with uh

681
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:18,079
n minus one we're going to pulverize

682
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:21,800
with you know uh sorry P

683
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:24,800
minus1 * Q

684
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,800
-1

685
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,560
okay why

686
00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:39,960
well suppose like you know suppose we we

687
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,680
we have done this already suppose

688
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:47,520
that

689
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:51,200
Ed is congruent mod uh let's call this

690
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,560
uh say m no M is for message let's call

691
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,560
it n

692
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,720
Prime congruent mod n Prime

693
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,720
to

694
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:09,440
one

695
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,160
okay what happens if we take M and raise

696
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,160
it to the Ed

697
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,480
power what is this equivalent to mod n

698
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:40,640
y okay so the answer was M yes

699
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,800
why don't

700
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,520
know fair enough I mean this is kind of

701
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,520
you know what we were aiming for so you

702
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:51,440
know very good educated

703
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,440
guess uh how could we prove

704
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,720
this

705
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,960
yeah uh so this is supposed to be an N

706
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,960
right so remember that uh you know when

707
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,760
we encrypt and decrypt those

708
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,680
computations are being done mod

709
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:12,400
n it's only the pulverizing that should

710
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:15,000
be done mod like using uh n Prime okay

711
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,280
so we're we're trying to so we're we're

712
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,079
assuming that Ed is congruent mod n

713
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:24,200
Prime to one right and so we find that

714
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:25,640
by pulverizing with with the N Prime but

715
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,640
you know after that we can forget about

716
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,599
NP Prime right we don't need nime

717
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,280
anymore we're just going to do all of

718
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:32,839
our computations mod n using you know e

719
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,839
and

720
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:35,839
D

721
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:42,880
okay so does anybody have any ideas how

722
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,880
we could prove this this statement

723
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,640
here what exactly is the statement

724
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:58,640
saying if we go back to the definitions

725
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:20,560
yeah yeah exactly so you've skipped a

726
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,200
couple of steps but um yes I will get to

727
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:26,359
that in a moment uh so this is saying

728
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,599
that you know uh n

729
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:31,760
divides m to the E

730
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:34,480
D minus uh

731
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,400
M

732
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,880
okay now at this point we can break

733
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,280
apart this n so all we really need to do

734
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:47,359
is you know prove that P and Q

735
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,359
separately divide m to the Ed minus

736
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,839
M or

737
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:57,839
equivalently that uh m to the Ed is

738
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:03,200
congruent

739
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:03,200
mod P and Q separately to

740
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,240
M

741
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,560
okay so if we prove these two things

742
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,560
then we're

743
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,720
done okay so p and Q are

744
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,440
symmetric so so you know let's let's

745
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,680
only prove it for p the same same exact

746
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,680
proof will work for

747
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,680
Q

748
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,640
okay

749
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,640
so how do we prove

750
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:57,319
now that m to the Ed is congruent mod P

751
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,319
to n how could we do this

752
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,359
any

753
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,240
ideas yeah

754
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,319
that's right okay so the answer was

755
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:46,280
basically that we've already done it

756
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:48,319
okay so remember that uh Ed is congruent

757
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:53,920
mod n Prime to

758
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:58,800
one okay so this means that n Prime

759
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:02,880
divides Ed minus one

760
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:08,119
okay well what is n Prime n

761
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:11,720
Prime equal pus1 Q minus

762
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:14,319
one so in particular Q minus

763
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:18,920
one no P minus

764
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:21,920
one divides Ed minus

765
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,920
one

766
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:30,359
okay so set otherwise e is congruent mod

767
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,480
P - one to

768
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:34,920
1

769
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,160
okay so that's exactly the uh condition

770
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,160
we had over here yeah

771
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,839
question uh so the question was how do

772
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:49,079
we know P minus1 divides edus

773
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:51,760
one uh P minus1 divides n

774
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:55,680
Prime right we defined n Prime to be the

775
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:58,319
product of Q -1 and P minus one okay so

776
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,400
we know that n Prime divides this and

777
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,000
one of our rules of divisibility was

778
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,480
that you know then any factors of n

779
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,480
Prime also divide

780
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,200
it

781
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,000
okay so we know that P minus one divides

782
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,160
Ed minus

783
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,880
one so that's just saying that Ed is

784
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:18,319
congruent to one mod P minus

785
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,480
one right and that's the condition we

786
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,599
add

787
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:26,559
here

788
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:26,559
okay so now by FLT

789
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,920
m to the

790
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,160
Ed is congruent mod

791
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,160
P to

792
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:42,240
M

793
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:46,400
okay so did people follow

794
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,880
that so we've got congruence mod

795
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,400
P by symmetry we also have congruence

796
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,720
mod Q right p and Q are you know they're

797
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,720
basically

798
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,040
symmetric

799
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:01,240
okay and now because they

800
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,839
Prime right we can say that if you know

801
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,440
p and Q both independently divide this

802
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:11,640
difference their product must divided as

803
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,640
well so that gives us congruence mod PQ

804
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:45,599
okay

805
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,599
questions

806
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,720
yeah okay so the the question was can we

807
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,960
uh you know go into this this step here

808
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,520
in more detail okay so remember that's

809
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:03,720
what we were doing over here right so

810
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,559
fma's little theorem right says that M

811
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,880
the p

812
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:10,720
minus1 is congruent to one mod

813
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:15,920
P okay

814
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:17,720
so if we raise these to any power K

815
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,839
right it's still going to be congruent

816
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:25,880
to one okay so m to the K * P minus1

817
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:30,119
will also be congruent to one right so m

818
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:33,559
to the K * P - 1 + 1 will be congruent

819
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:33,559
to one

820
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,920
okay this here is saying that Ed has

821
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:42,400
that form it's some multiple of P minus

822
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,079
one +

823
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,400
1

824
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:53,240
okay so basically we're applying FLT

825
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,240
repeatedly just as we did over here

826
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,359
okay are people reasonably happy with

827
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,520
this

828
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,240
yeah okay so why are we using p minus1

829
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:22,760
and Q minus1 in the first

830
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,359
place uh in short I pulled them out of

831
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,480
my house so it would

832
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:30,839
work uh

833
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:33,920
so this is um you know it's basically a

834
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:34,839
generalization of of FLT uh called

835
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:40,119
Oilers

836
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:43,040
theorem um it turns out that uh you know

837
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:45,200
this P min-1 * Q

838
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:49,480
-1 is what we

839
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:53,040
call V of n where V is Oiler to

840
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:55,760
function uh this counts the number of of

841
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,720
uh you know numbers up to n that are

842
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,359
co-prime with n

843
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:05,400
so basically we can we can use the same

844
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:08,160
proof uh as we did you know

845
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,400
Tuesday uh to show that you know if we

846
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,680
want to get rid of this assumption that

847
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:15,119
P is prime over

848
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,359
here uh we can replace this this P minus

849
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,520
one with P of

850
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:20,240
n uh and then then we get congruence mod

851
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,839
mod

852
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,720
n

853
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:27,480
okay uh we just kind of proved the

854
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,760
special case where n is the product of

855
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:31,079
of two

856
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:34,599
primes

857
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:37,920
um but uh yeah basically it's it's kind

858
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:40,160
of it's kind of a guess and check right

859
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,599
like all we all we really need to know

860
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,440
is that this works we don't really need

861
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:45,440
to know how we got

862
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,839
there okay

863
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:09,480
Okay so we've proven that uh you know if

864
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:13,680
we encrypt something by you know raising

865
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,480
it to the uh eth Power mod n and then we

866
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,599
decrypt it by raising it to the D power

867
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,040
mod mod n we're going to get back to the

868
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,559
same thing we started with

869
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:25,400
Okay so this crypto system is at least

870
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:28,520
you know correct right we can uh encrypt

871
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,839
a message and then decrypt it again

872
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,839
is it

873
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:48,119
secure oh

874
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:50,680
sorry actually why me

875
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:52,960
just do

876
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:57,400
that

877
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,040
okay so uh is RSA secure

878
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,920
right we we said before that if we're

879
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,839
just using a prime instead of this

880
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,960
product of two primes then uh anybody

881
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:08,799
else can can computer secret

882
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:11,599
key okay what are we doing

883
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:16,400
now

884
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,400
well one we're choosing random

885
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:27,440
primes large primes so think of these as

886
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,440
like having hundreds of digits okay

887
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:37,200
okay uh next we're going to set n equals

888
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,079
their

889
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,000
product

890
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:47,119
and uh let's just call it f of n

891
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,119
nowal p -1 * Q

892
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:53,680
-1 and next we're going to choose a

893
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,680
random e

894
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,920
co-prime with

895
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:12,720
this and then we want to pulverize it we

896
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:12,720
want to compute an inverse of

897
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:26,960
e so why don't I write it this this

898
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:26,960
compute a multiplicative inverse

899
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,720
modulo uh F of

900
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,280
n

901
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:41,960
okay now what is the public key public

902
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:44,960
key is going to be oops K sub p is going

903
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:49,559
to be n comma

904
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:52,119
e k sub s is going to be n comma

905
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:55,559
D

906
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:58,559
okay so before when we had uh oh

907
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,559
question

908
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,920
okay uh how hard is it to choose e

909
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,559
that's that's co-

910
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:13,720
Prime uh it's actually not that hard uh

911
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:15,280
so in practice usually you would you

912
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:17,559
know not choose it totally randomly

913
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,799
you'd have a fairly small e so that

914
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:20,760
encryption is

915
00:51:18,799 --> 00:51:24,680
efficient uh but if you wanted to do it

916
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:28,559
totally randomly right like how many how

917
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,559
many things are not co-prime to

918
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:48,319
uh so yeah multiples of the prime

919
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:52,799
factors yes um so let's see have you did

920
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:55,599
we do the carmichel numbers yet no okay

921
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:58,040
so uh well it turns out that if you

922
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,599
choose a random a random number it'll

923
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:02,880
actually be co-prime with reasonably

924
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:05,079
good probability okay uh but you know in

925
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,240
practice right we're going to just you

926
00:52:05,079 --> 00:52:10,240
know choose a fairly small

927
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,240
e

928
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,480
okay

929
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:23,920
okay so we said that if if we just you

930
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,839
know forget about Q use nals P this

931
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,920
doesn't work because anybody else can

932
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:30,319
then you know compute our our secret key

933
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,720
in the same way as we computed it

934
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:36,599
ourselves why does this not happen

935
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,960
here why can nobody else compute the

936
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:41,640
secret

937
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:41,640
key given the public

938
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:46,839
key

939
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:55,640
yeah yeah so the the basic idea is that

940
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,640
we're relying on factoring being hard

941
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:23,839
okay uh so the the basic idea right is

942
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:27,280
that if you have n it's it should be

943
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:29,640
hard to to come up with with p and Q

944
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,720
okay and I claim that this is actually a

945
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,240
much safer assumption than was used with

946
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,760
Enigma uh because this is a very well

947
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,680
studied problem like people have been

948
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,799
trying to factor things more efficiently

949
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:43,480
for you know hundreds of years right and

950
00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:45,960
you know mathematicians have not found

951
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:49,040
an efficient way of of doing this so in

952
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:51,440
particular the adversary will will also

953
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:53,119
presumably not be able to do it right

954
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,440
it's not just saying like I personally

955
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,440
couldn't come up with a with a good

956
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,280
factoring algorithm this is you know

957
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:01,000
relying on you know many years of of

958
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,760
work by many mathematicians okay it

959
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,839
still is possible that that factoring

960
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,520
isn't hard like you know and in fact

961
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:08,119
maybe maybe somebody already knows how

962
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:10,880
to do it they've got they've got their

963
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:13,240
algorithm they just haven't published it

964
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:16,160
uh but the assumption is basically like

965
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,680
if one could do it then one of these

966
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,880
mathematicians would have would have

967
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,920
figured it out okay like one of these

968
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,319
World

969
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:28,000
experts

970
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:32,640
okay uh so more formally though

971
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,640
if we could compute the uh

972
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,040
uh ah okay question was isn't this just

973
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,720
cryptography by

974
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:42,079
huis okay I claim that I'm not relying

975
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:44,160
solely on you know my own intelligence

976
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,520
I'm relying on you know everybody else

977
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:49,119
like the the entire field of mathematics

978
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:51,240
okay like like many mathematicians have

979
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,520
spent like their entire careers trying

980
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,720
to you know Factor things

981
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,200
quickly and nobody's figured out how to

982
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:00,599
do it yet it's not just like you know I

983
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,160
was spending half an hour in my basement

984
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:04,520
and you know I I couldn't figure out a

985
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:07,000
good algorithm in that time you know

986
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,839
like the the the Enigma engineer right

987
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,960
like you know he just came up with

988
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:13,040
something and then couldn't figure out a

989
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:16,440
way how to a way to to break it and so

990
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:19,520
kind of just assumed security from that

991
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:21,160
right so it's it's kind of you know me

992
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,160
versus the entire field of of

993
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,160
mathematics

994
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:38,079
okay okay so yeah I guess the question

995
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:39,640
is you know given uh so if we had an

996
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:42,480
algorithm that would you know compute

997
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:46,119
the secret key from the public key how

998
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,119
would this Factor end

999
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:07,680
right notice that the uh secret key

1000
00:56:03,319 --> 00:56:07,680
doesn't actually contain p andq

1001
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:50,480
so I suppose as described we aren't

1002
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,839
quite relying on the hardness of

1003
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,640
factoring we're relying on something

1004
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:58,240
slightly different

1005
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,240
yeah oh sorry

1006
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:07,319
uh no how do how do we um so if we could

1007
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,359
find the uh the private key the secret

1008
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:10,720
key given the public key how would this

1009
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,440
then factor

1010
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:17,119
in right we we would like to rely on the

1011
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,119
the hardness of factorization

1012
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,039
okay so the the answer was basically

1013
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:51,280
that that you have to come up with the

1014
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:52,319
prime factors p and Q before you can uh

1015
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,680
before you can

1016
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:57,680
compute uh D from e

1017
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:03,839
uh we would like to say that you know no

1018
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:04,960
matter how you do it you're still

1019
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:07,240
basically going to end up with the

1020
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,520
factors p and Q right like you will have

1021
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,760
solved the problem even if you didn't

1022
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,240
intend

1023
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,240
to does that make

1024
00:58:19,799 --> 00:58:30,240
sense okay so suppose I have n e d

1025
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:31,319
okay so suppose I've I've used the uh

1026
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,839
the public key to come up with the

1027
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:34,160
secret key so now I have these three

1028
00:58:32,839 --> 00:58:37,240
pieces of

1029
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:40,720
information right does this now allow me

1030
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,720
to factor in

1031
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:07,960
does anybody remember the quadratic

1032
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:07,960
formula from uh from grade

1033
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,760
school it's okay I don't

1034
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,000
either

1035
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,119
okay

1036
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,559
[Music]

1037
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:20,559
so if I have end d

1038
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,599
right Ed minus one

1039
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,599
should

1040
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:41,280
be a multiple of P

1041
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,280
-1 * Q

1042
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,079
-1

1043
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,160
okay what happens if I reduce that mod

1044
00:59:55,039 --> 01:00:00,200
in

1045
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:03,119
hm I get one uh if I reduce it mod P - 1

1046
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,119
* Q -1 I get

1047
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:12,200
one

1048
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:12,200
yeah get p and

1049
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:20,240
Q okay let's let's make it a little bit

1050
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:23,000
simpler suppose I actually have p minus1

1051
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:28,960
and Q -1 or P -1 * Q

1052
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,960
-1 if I had that could I factor in for

1053
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:01,280
so if I had that I could oh yeah

1054
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:34,119
mhm yeah so if we actually had P min-1 *

1055
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:36,359
Q - one we could use that to figure out

1056
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:39,240
the sum of p and Q we know their product

1057
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,240
we can use the quadratic

1058
01:01:39,319 --> 01:01:42,319
formula

1059
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:49,520
okay what happens if we just have Ed uh

1060
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,520
sorry e and

1061
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,880
D can we do something similar

1062
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,079
oh actually I'm running quite short on

1063
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:15,039
time okay uh why don't we hold off on

1064
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:16,960
that uh let's just take it on faith that

1065
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:19,680
we're relying on factoring being hard

1066
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:22,039
let's move on to

1067
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:24,359
uh the last thing that we wanted to

1068
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:24,359
cover

1069
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:32,559
today which is a uh slightly different

1070
01:02:28,839 --> 01:02:35,000
application of uh of number Theory which

1071
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,279
you may find useful in uh you know

1072
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:42,480
throughout computer

1073
01:02:36,279 --> 01:02:42,480
science um notice where is it

1074
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,279
uh okay

1075
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:59,559
here so here we kind of

1076
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:03,039
uh we're trying to work mod n right n is

1077
01:02:59,559 --> 01:03:03,039
the fact or n is the product of two

1078
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,960
primes and we said that it's easier

1079
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:08,480
instead of working mod n we're going to

1080
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:11,359
work mod the two primes

1081
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,799
individually okay so it turns out that

1082
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,720
this this is something that you can do

1083
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:19,480
in general right uh this is what we call

1084
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:22,559
the Chinese remainder theorem right uh

1085
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:24,319
if you have uh in fact if you have two

1086
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:27,200
co-prime numbers p and

1087
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:28,640
Q working modulo their product is

1088
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,599
equivalent to working modulo each of

1089
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,160
them

1090
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:35,200
individually okay and often working

1091
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,279
modulo you know the the smaller numbers

1092
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,520
individually is going to be you know

1093
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:44,119
much easier than working modu the the

1094
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:47,599
large number okay so as a very simple

1095
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:50,680
example uh suppose we

1096
01:03:47,599 --> 01:03:54,319
have the

1097
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:56,520
following uh actually strictly less than

1098
01:03:54,319 --> 01:04:01,200
55 okay

1099
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:06,440
and we know that X is congruent mod 5 to

1100
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:08,640
4 x congruent mod 11 to

1101
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,799
7

1102
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:13,920
okay I claim that we have enough

1103
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:18,799
information now to Unique identify

1104
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,799
X okay can anybody do it

1105
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,319
how might we do

1106
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,760
it

1107
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:55,119
yeah okay uh so the answer was you know

1108
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:57,200
try everything between 0 and 55 uh see

1109
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:59,319
what they're con to mod four or Mod Five

1110
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,559
see what they're conent to mod 11 and

1111
01:04:59,319 --> 01:05:02,839
see whether it satisfies both of those I

1112
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:05,880
claim that we can do it slightly faster

1113
01:05:02,839 --> 01:05:08,480
than that uh why don't we enumerate

1114
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,599
everything that satisfies uh this

1115
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,400
congruence

1116
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:14,400
first okay so what is congruent to seven

1117
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,880
modul 11 in this

1118
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:20,680
range right so that tells us that maybe

1119
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,799
I should write it down here oops X is in

1120
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:26,680
the following

1121
01:05:21,799 --> 01:05:28,359
set 7 18

1122
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:30,440
29

1123
01:05:28,359 --> 01:05:34,000
40

1124
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:36,920
51 and if we add 11 again we get past

1125
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,200
55

1126
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:43,640
okay now we only have to check uh five

1127
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:45,720
numbers to see which is congruent to uh

1128
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:48,960
uh to four modul

1129
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:50,960
5 and if we look at them 29 is the only

1130
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:54,520
one that

1131
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:59,400
works okay so it turns out that there's

1132
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:59,400
a unique answer modulo

1133
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:05,440
55

1134
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:07,359
okay and we can actually do this in

1135
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,359
general and in fact even more

1136
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:13,200
efficiently so Chinese remainder theorem

1137
01:06:10,359 --> 01:06:16,599
often abbreviated

1138
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,599
CRT so

1139
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:20,920
suppose p and Q are

1140
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:27,559
co-prime okay and a and b

1141
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
are

1142
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:35,359
integers

1143
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,839
okay and we have the

1144
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:38,839
following system of

1145
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:49,160
congruences

1146
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:51,599
okay so if we have this then there is a

1147
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:56,640
unique solution there's a unique X that

1148
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:56,640
satisfies this modulo PQ

1149
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,960
okay so how might we prove this what

1150
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,520
what are the elements that we need to

1151
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,520
prove

1152
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,160
yeah

1153
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:50,799
sorry oh here

1154
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:54,200
fien uh here

1155
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:55,520
fien yeah so you don't have to worry

1156
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,039
about what this is actually called we

1157
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:59,720
could call this n

1158
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:02,480
Prime but

1159
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:06,680
yeah sorry this was just following up on

1160
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,680
on what one of your classmates asked uh

1161
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,160
earlier

1162
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,799
okay so what are the elements that we

1163
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:17,319
need to prove in order to prove this

1164
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,319
this theorem

1165
01:08:22,199 --> 01:08:27,279
here well we need to prove existence

1166
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:30,440
and then we need to prove that there

1167
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:33,719
don't exist two

1168
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:35,279
solutions okay so let's start with let's

1169
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:40,600
start with

1170
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:40,600
existence why does there exist a

1171
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:46,000
solution maybe we can start thinking

1172
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:49,279
about a special case so

1173
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,480
suppose uh suppose for for a start that

1174
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,440
a equals

1175
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:56,120
Zer

1176
01:08:52,440 --> 01:09:00,520
okay how could we find a solution

1177
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:05,640
uh to X congruent uh to b modul

1178
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:05,640
q and x congruent to zero modul

1179
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,600
P

1180
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,600
yeah

1181
01:09:18,679 --> 01:09:24,000
sure yeah

1182
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:26,719
so the relation here is that uh you know

1183
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:30,359
we've got our p and Q are 5 and

1184
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:32,759
11 right our A and B are 4 and

1185
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:35,159
seven and so we're saying that there's a

1186
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:38,279
unique solution to to you know this

1187
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:41,359
system of congruences modulo 55 which is

1188
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:44,120
their product okay or you know you could

1189
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:46,440
also phrase that as there is a unique X

1190
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:47,239
in this range like a unique integer X in

1191
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,799
this

1192
01:09:47,239 --> 01:09:52,520
range

1193
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:54,840
okay so we're just kind of we're just

1194
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:55,840
kind of G to generalize this kind of to

1195
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:57,520
um you know

1196
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:59,159
a more General p and Q more General A

1197
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:05,159
and

1198
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:05,159
B okay question or oh

1199
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:21,280
sorry

1200
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:22,679
okay well if we look at the special case

1201
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:27,320
where a equals

1202
01:10:22,679 --> 01:10:30,159
z why don't we start by defining

1203
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:32,120
uh P minus

1204
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:36,280
one p

1205
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:36,280
inverse uh to be a modular

1206
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:45,719
inverse of p

1207
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:52,239
modulo

1208
01:10:49,239 --> 01:10:52,239
q

1209
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:58,920
okay and now let's multiply that by P to

1210
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:03,159
get the

1211
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:03,159
integer uh e

1212
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,080
subq

1213
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:15,040
okay now what can we say about e subq

1214
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:46,679
what is it congruent to modul p

1215
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:05,440
yeah yeah so we defined it to be a

1216
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:09,920
multiple of P so e

1217
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:14,320
subq is going to be congruent mod P to

1218
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:14,320
zero okay what about modulo

1219
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:21,800
Q what is it congruent to modulo

1220
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:26,280
Q

1221
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:29,880
yeah one yeah so by definition

1222
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:32,320
right P inverse is a multiplicative

1223
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:36,400
inverse of p modul q so when you

1224
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:36,400
multiply them you get one mod

1225
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:46,719
Q okay so how can we use e sub Q to get

1226
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:48,440
X remember remember we're thinking of

1227
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:51,239
the special case where a equals

1228
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:57,000
z so we're trying to find a multiple of

1229
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:57,000
P that's congruent to b modu q

1230
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,960
anybody yeah

1231
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:34,800
yeah so the answer was multiply EQ by B

1232
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:41,120
okay B * EQ now is congruent to zero

1233
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:41,120
modul p and 1 * B which is B modul

1234
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,960
Q okay does that make sense to

1235
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:54,880
everybody so for the more General case

1236
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:06,639
we are going to

1237
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:06,639
Define uh e subp

1238
01:14:13,239 --> 01:14:16,239
analogously

1239
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,840
okay now how how do you think we could

1240
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:25,520
solve the more General

1241
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:29,719
case instead of just B * zq

1242
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,719
how do we then you know fold EP into

1243
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,600
it

1244
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:53,480
y

1245
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:56,320
yeah so

1246
01:14:53,480 --> 01:15:02,600
claim X

1247
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:02,600
equal a e p + b e

1248
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,840
q is a

1249
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:11,679
solution

1250
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:26,760
okay so we can verify each of these two

1251
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:28,960
congruences

1252
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:31,320
separately right so if we look at the

1253
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:35,120
first congruence what happens if we

1254
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:35,120
reduce this x modu

1255
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:40,760
p well modulo P this EP here is

1256
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:45,000
congruent to

1257
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:48,600
one so this term becomes

1258
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:51,239
a uh we said that EQ is defined to be a

1259
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:52,000
multiple of P so the second term just

1260
01:15:51,239 --> 01:15:58,040
goes

1261
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:01,560
away so modulo p X is now congruent to

1262
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:04,360
a modulo q it's exactly the opposite

1263
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:08,080
right this term goes away because the

1264
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:08,080
the EP was defined to be a multiple of

1265
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:15,480
Q right and

1266
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,480
uh

1267
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:23,880
sorry yes this is defined to be a

1268
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:26,920
multiple of Q and uh I've done it the

1269
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,920
wrong way around haven't I

1270
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:35,120
Q mod

1271
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,120
q no no we're fine

1272
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:40,920
okay so EP is a multiple of Q the a term

1273
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:46,960
goes

1274
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:52,360
away uh B * EQ is going to be one

1275
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:52,360
okay sorry B * EQ is going to be B

1276
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,280
okay so what about

1277
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,239
uniqueness how might we prove

1278
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:23,960
uniqueness what is the what is the setup

1279
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,960
going to look like

1280
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:47,040
yeah okay so the the idea was show that

1281
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:51,320
any candidate solution so let's say x

1282
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:56,080
Prime is actually the same solution okay

1283
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:58,840
so let X and X Prime be

1284
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,840
to

1285
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:04,639
Solutions

1286
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,920
okay now what are we trying to

1287
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:18,760
show

1288
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:21,239
yeah uh not

1289
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:22,920
equals so we're not trying to we're not

1290
01:18:21,239 --> 01:18:25,239
trying to prove there are unique

1291
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:28,480
integers right we're trying to prove

1292
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:31,760
that it's Unique modul PQ so we want to

1293
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,760
show that they're congruent modul

1294
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:41,480
PQ

1295
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,480
okay how can we do

1296
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:49,639
this well what is the definition of this

1297
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:59,280
equivalence we could do this by showing

1298
01:18:55,639 --> 01:19:03,360
that uh you know PQ

1299
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:03,360
divides x - x

1300
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:12,000
Prime now in order to do that right we

1301
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:16,239
can look at p and Q

1302
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:19,239
separately okay so why does p divide the

1303
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:19,239
difference

1304
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,040
well both of them satisfy that first

1305
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:32,280
equation or that first

1306
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:35,239
congruence okay so both of them are

1307
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:36,320
congruent to a modulo p if you subtract

1308
01:19:35,239 --> 01:19:39,520
them you get

1309
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:41,760
zero okay so P divides the

1310
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,880
difference now because they both satisfy

1311
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,920
the second

1312
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:51,280
congruence right uh you subtract them

1313
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:55,639
you get B minus B right so there so the

1314
01:19:51,280 --> 01:20:00,000
the so Q divides the difference as well

1315
01:19:55,639 --> 01:20:00,000
okay so p and Q

1316
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:12,120
individually

1317
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:17,480
okay and by assumption they're co-prime

1318
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,440
so their product must then also divide

1319
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:23,440
the

1320
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:23,440
difference okay

1321
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:45,440
okay so that means that x and x Prime

1322
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:48,040
must be congruent modu of

1323
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:51,560
PQ okay so that's all we have time for

1324
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:54,760
today um yeah you'll see you'll get more

1325
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:57,080
practice with uh RSA and CRT in uh in

1326
01:20:54,760 --> 01:21:01,480
recitation tomorrow and uh yeah feel

1327
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,480
free to uh come up if you have questions
