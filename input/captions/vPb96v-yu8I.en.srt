2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:17,279
good morning Bangkok how are

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,880
you yeah so my name is Anuj Bala I am a

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,720
Sloan fellow graduate of MIT 2016 I'm

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,679
the CEO and chief data scientist at

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,359
service Mob We are an AI and machine

7
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,680
learning platform for the customer

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,280
service industry providing analytics to

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,120
drive insights that are somewhat

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,559
unintuitive right we are revolutionizing

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,559
customer service in the ontological

12
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,239
customer block we'll tell you what that

13
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,719
actually means um the big problem is

14
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,359
it's

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,039
2025 we could land a rocket ship upright

16
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,559
back on the

17
00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:00,280
Launchpad but customer service is

18
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,879
terrible this is a huge huge problem

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,239
across many different Industries despite

20
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,960
the Advent of so much technology so much

21
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,640
AI customer service worldwide is the

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,920
worst perceived than it's ever been and

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,560
it's costing companies more money than

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,360
ever especially when switching costs are

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,400
low uh uh qualtrix estimates $500

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,200
billion dollar US globally just on the

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,119
switching economy but businesses are are

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,439
still struggling with customer service

29
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,560
why is this

30
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,840
and I'm going to let everybody in this

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,479
room in on a little secret of why your

32
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,200
customer service is bad in

33
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,560
2025 we're measuring customer service

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,880
all

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,960
wrong I'm going to say that again we're

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,119
measuring customer service all wrong

37
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,680
just like the good professor was talking

38
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,399
about training AI to look at cats and

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,280
dogs and understand what those are from

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,560
a machine level we are doing the same

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,640
thing except

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,840
we're doing it for customer

43
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,239
experiences imagine that customer

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,280
experiences it's not a real thing it's a

45
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,800
it's a concept right but we at in

46
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,480
customer service are measuring

47
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,160
interactions we're not measuring

48
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,879
customer experiences until now service

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,959
mob is the first company ever to use

50
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,680
machine learning to identify experiences

51
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,319
in the data customer service doesn't

52
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,800
necessarily happen on one transaction

53
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,640
every single passive and active

54
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,239
interaction you have with the brand is

55
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,840
part of your experience all the way from

56
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,159
a service perspective from your need of

57
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,000
customer service all the way to a

58
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:48,440
resolution and every single touch point

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,959
that you have in between is part of that

60
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,239
experience it's never really been

61
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,280
measured or looked at until now so we

62
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,400
are using machine learning to truly

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,800
understand experiences and redime I this

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,360
for measurements that are new and novel

65
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,640
for the space as a result we've been

66
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,920
able to help companies this is a case

67
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,840
study from a publicly traded travel and

68
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,200
hospitality company one of the emerging

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,720
uh you know companies even in the uh

70
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,440
APAC space and we were able to save them

71
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,239
$5 million to their bottom line that

72
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,120
blue line was the amount of headcount

73
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,319
they needed before the the uh purple

74
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,799
line is the amount of headcount they

75
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,560
needed after using service to find the

76
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,920
insights in the data that are truly

77
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,879
improving customer experience uh service

78
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,680
Titan one of the largest IPOs the

79
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,879
largest IPO in 2024 one of our first

80
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,879
customers we saved them over 13 million

81
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,799
in cost of flection just last year 78%

82
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,680
reduction in contact rate 80% reduction

83
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,239
in Abandonment for a hypergrowth company

84
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:00,319
and look the data problem has changed

85
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,480
with generative AI we can interrogate

86
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,840
these large ontologies ontology is just

87
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,120
a word for data model but we're looking

88
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,400
at that that data model for the customer

89
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,040
experience and we can inter uh

90
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,319
interrogate those large ontology models

91
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,479
with llms to get Precision level

92
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,680
insights on what's affecting you and

93
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:23,440
your customer experience with the brand

94
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,000
and now predict and prescribe actions to

95
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,919
improve that experience with your

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,400
customers so that they're spending more

97
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,199
money with you and not your competitor

98
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,639
we're we also providing the Performance

99
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,600
Management so whether you're a bot and

100
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:39,600
or a human or something in between we're

101
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,960
providing that eval Loop to essentially

102
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,680
provide if you think about those pairs

103
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,400
of outcomes and the pairs of inputs part

104
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,960
of what we're doing is being able to

105
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,400
show what a satisfied customer really

106
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:56,039
looks like which is the product of

107
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,880
customer service so please uh you know

108
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:00,199
we think that uh we're already in the

109
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,560
region working with many companies

110
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,680

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,039
love to partner with SAS companies

112
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,320
