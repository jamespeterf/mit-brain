1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,480
A lot of the industries, a lot of

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,200
households, neighborhoods, cities, even

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,120
countries are shifting to deploying more

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,719
renewable energy within their grid. And

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,750
with that, we definitely need a proper

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,920
energy storage system.

[Music]

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,520
I'm researching lithium ion batteries,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,920
specifically the recycling and

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,760
rejuvenation process. After we use the

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,840
lithium ion batteries, they usually

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,519
reach something called the end of life.

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,439
In industry terms, it's defined as

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,680
reaching the 80% of its original

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,600
capacity. When the battery goes to that

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,680
stage, what we can do with it is either

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,360
throw it away or recycle it. There's

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,079
different methods to do lithium ion

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,239
battery recycling. One, the option is to

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,600
open this battery and check the valuable

21
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,280
materials in it and make sure that we

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,280
are able to reuse them. And this is

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,640
known as the recycling method. Two, it

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,360
could be rejuvenation, which is

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,640
basically trying to add more electrolyte

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,239
to see if this would improve the

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,399
battery's performance in the least

28
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,480
invasive way possible for the battery. I

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,719
decided to start working in the energy

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,479
field because of where I'm from and

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,240
because of all the energy crisis that

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,200
we've passed through. I'm from Lebanon.

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,040
We had the huge time of power cuts and

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,960
then a lot of people started actually

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,960
purchasing solar panels and installing

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,960
them on the roofs. with that you need to

37
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,960
back it up with an energy storage system

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,880
and that means batteries. And it was a

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,080
challenging time because a lot of people

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,600
just wanted to do that because they

41
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,920
wanted more electricity because they

42
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,560
would only had 30 minutes to like

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,000
maximum of like 3 4 hours a day of power

44
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,680
coming directly from the grid which was

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,920
not enough definitely for people's

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,520
everyday uses. That sparked my interest

47
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,840
in actually learning more about it. I

48
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,840
hope that my research will have um a lot

49
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,840
of impact on the world and on this

50
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,759
community around me. So hopefully we get

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,880
to an answer or at least part of an

52
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,880
answer sometime soon.
