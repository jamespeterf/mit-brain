1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:16,240
just begin with.

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,440
So uh if we have a

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,440
a metric space here

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,320
uh then uh a cover of

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,239
of x uh is a collection

6
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,120
uh of subsets

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,280
u alpha so that the

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,680
uh

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:57,360
uh x is contained in the union of u

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,879
alpha. So that's a cover of x. And

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,359
likewise

12
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,359
uh likewise

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:14,680
if a here is a subset of x then

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,680
uh u alpha is a cover

15
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:23,600
of a if a here is in the union of the u

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,320
alpha.

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,920
So that's what it needs to cover as the

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:34,079
whole set or just a subset.

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,439
Then uh there are some covers that are

20
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:42,680
particularly important and those are the

21
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,680
open covers. So a open cover

22
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:52,200
is a cover

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,200
uh that consists

24
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,439
of uh open subsets.

25
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:10,879
And then finally we have uh that so if

26
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:17,080
again x comma d is a metric space a here

27
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,080
is a subset of x then we say that

28
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,920
that uh that a is compact

29
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,319
uh if every

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,120
A open copper

31
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,760
of a has a finite

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,720
uh subco.

33
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,640
Okay.

34
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,110
And one thing we proved last time was

35
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,400
that if you have

36
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,640
[Applause]

37
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:10,120
if you have a so proved last time that

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:10,120
if if you have a if a here is compact

39
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,280
then uh

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,280
then uh a is

41
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,040
is bound

42
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,920
and closed.

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,400
Okay.

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,040
Um

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,280
right. So it's a is a closed subset

46
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:45,360
meaning that the complement is is um is

47
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,440
open and uh a itself is contained in

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
some large ball centered at some point

49
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,000
in x.

50
00:03:49,360 --> 00:04:00,080
Okay. Now the the converse is not the

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,439
case always. So uh so

52
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,680
in RN

53
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,319
uh with

54
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,319
the usual metric

55
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,400
you cleaning metric

56
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,320
the converse is the

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,880
But in general, not

58
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,880
but not in general.

59
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:50,160
Okay. And so we looked at one example

60
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,800
on this uh last time.

61
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,919
So we looked at the following example

62
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,440
but it was a rather trivial example that

63
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:05,280
if you take x here if you take the space

64
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:08,400
x to be say the interval from 0 to one

65
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,560
uh and uh the metric here this here is

66
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,520
the usual metric.

67
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,800
So the distance between two uh elements

68
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,039
here is is just the norm of the

69
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:26,400
difference

70
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:29,039
and then well x is the whole set. So x

71
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,600
so with this here x is the whole set. So

72
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:35,360
x here if you think if this here is the

73
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,160
metric space then x is by definition

74
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,520
closed because the whole set is closed

75
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,080
right. It's not closed as a subset of R.

76
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,479
But if it's if if the matrix space just

77
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:52,479
is X, you know, then then it is closed

78
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,600
and it's it's bounded

79
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:59,199
and bounded.

80
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:03,600
In particular, this interval here is

81
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:06,800
contained in the ball of radius 1/2

82
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,400
around 1/2, but it's actually equal to

83
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,759
that ball, if you will. Right?

84
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,479
So it's definitely bounded

85
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,479
but it's not compact. Right? So it not

86
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,479
compact

87
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,479
because you can write x here as the

88
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,560
union of

89
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,160
1 / n

90
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:38,560
to one and now you take the union over

91
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,120
all inte positive integers right and but

92
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,919
if you only take finitely many of them

93
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,360
then you don't get all the way down to

94
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,680
zero Right? So it's it's not a union.

95
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,280
It's union of all of these. The each of

96
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,000
these are is open

97
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,160
but you but there's no finite union of

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,199
those sets that cover X.

99
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:07,680
A more interesting example

100
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:10,639
um is that suppose you take

101
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,160
suppose you take um so here's another

102
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,039
example

103
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,080
that we didn't get to last time. that if

104
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,560
you take the continuous function on the

105
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,479
unit interval.

106
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,120
Uh and so if you take and now we use

107
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,120
this metric that we have looked at

108
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,120
before

109
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,400
where the

110
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,759
uh distance between two functions

111
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:45,000
is the max

112
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,000
uh over x in this interval here

113
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:54,479
uh of the norm of f ofx minus g ofx. X

114
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,680
right we've already seen that this here

115
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:01,840
is a nice metric right

116
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:06,879
uh and and if I now look at in this

117
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:11,039
metric I look at the the unit ball so

118
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:13,919
I'm looking at the closed unit ball so

119
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,440
uh which means that I'm looking at the

120
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,919
set

121
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,280
the set uh of functions there

122
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:27,280
so that the distance

123
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:31,840
of f to the function that is constant

124
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:37,839
equal to zero this distance here

125
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:40,320
is sorry is uh less or equal to one

126
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:44,480
so I'm looking here

127
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:47,279
at the subset of the continuous function

128
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,279
on this interval

129
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,440
So that the distance to the zero

130
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,440
function is at most one. So let me just

131
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:01,360
write this out. Right? So this means

132
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:06,160
that uh this is the function f in this

133
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:08,640
continuous function here. So that

134
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,320
um the max

135
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:16,560
of f ofx minus zero. So I don't really

136
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:20,959
have to write zero is

137
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,040
is is less or equal to one.

138
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,720
Right?

139
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:30,160
Now this set again this set here is what

140
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,120
we denote by the this is like the closed

141
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,320
unit ball because you have lesser equal

142
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,760
to here right. So and the closed unit

143
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,000
ball the open unit ball we have written

144
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,560
and this is now the the function that is

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,360
identically equal to zero

146
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,040
the open unit ball we wrote like this

147
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,760
right this is if you have strict

148
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:57,440
inequality and to to to denote that is

149
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,519
lesser equal to I'm just putting a bar

150
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,160
here

151
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,160
okay

152
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,040
and so we already know that this thing

153
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,440
Here if you take a metric space and

154
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,360
you're looking at a closed unit ball

155
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,920
like this we already proved that this

156
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,480
here is closed right because you prove

157
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:21,040
directly using the triangle inequality

158
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,920
that the complement is open right

159
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,240
okay so that's if so this is a closed

160
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,160
subset it's obviously bounded right

161
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,240
because it's actually even just a ball

162
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,120
right

163
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,920
um now

164
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,600
so how but I claim that it's so it's

165
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:43,360
it's closed it's bounded

166
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:47,600
but it doesn't it's not compact and and

167
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:52,240
here's a sort of interesting example uh

168
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:57,160
of a sequence of element in this form so

169
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,160
I will now construct for each

170
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,240
for each n which is a natural number

171
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,640
uh we construct a function

172
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,959
uh fn

173
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,959
in this

174
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,040
that is a continuous function on this

175
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,760
unit interval and the function f um will

176
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,720
be given as follows.

177
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,720
It's will be

178
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,839
it will be uh one

179
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,839
uh from

180
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,360
uh from

181
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,360
uh when

182
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,920
uh see let me make it uh zero.

183
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:55,200
Uh I guess doesn't matter. I I make it

184
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:58,000
one uh when uh x here is between um 1 /

185
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,560
n + one. No

186
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,279
when zero is I would make it equal to

187
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:10,680
one when x here is bigger equal to zero

188
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,680
and lesser equal to 1 / n + one.

189
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:21,600
Then I'll make it um when when x here is

190
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:26,000
bigger than or equal to 1 / n but lesser

191
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,720
equal to one then I'll set it equal to

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:34,160
uh to to zero

193
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:36,480
and then you see now I want it to be so

194
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,560
so let me just so let's look at it. So

195
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,560
this function here is

196
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,560
um

197
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,480
so so this function here is if you draw

198
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:00,800
this function so

199
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:06,880
I have here one here I have zero

200
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:09,440
and this function is one um up to uh 1 /

201
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,160
n +1. Maybe I'll draw it a little bit

202
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:17,360
further out. Uh actually make the

203
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:22,160
picture bigger.

204
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:26,160
So like that. Here I have one.

205
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Here I have uh 1 /

206
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:34,800
n + one and here I have 1 / n.

207
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,800
And the function is supposed to be one

208
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,800
here.

209
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,200
And then it's supposed to uh die off

210
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,240
between here

211
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,240
and here. And I will I choose it to die

212
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,519
off linearly and then a zero here.

213
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,560
So if it's going down linearly this

214
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,440
means that I have right what is the

215
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,839
difference between two these two it's 1

216
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:10,800
/ n minus 1 / n + one this is this

217
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,959
distance here and so this here putting

218
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:18,720
it on a common denominator n +1 / n * n

219
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:20,800
+1 this is what you get from this and if

220
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,079
you put it on the common denominator for

221
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,600
the second one this is what you get here

222
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,160
and so this is just one over n

223
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,240
like this right

224
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:39,040
and so this is this distance here

225
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:44,040
and so if I define the function to be

226
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,040
uh right so I'm setting it equal to

227
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:53,360
to this and now in between when x here

228
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:57,600
is bigger equal to 1 / n +1 and lesser

229
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,519
equal to 1 / n. I will set it equal to 1

230
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,880
minus

231
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:08,279
um n * n +

232
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,279
uh 1

233
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,519
um times sorry let me make more space.

234
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,839
Yeah, let me make more space.

235
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,639
So here this here was when zero is less

236
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,320
or equal to x less or equal to 1 / n +

237
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:35,800
1.

238
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,800
This is when uh x here is between

239
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:44,240
these two numbers and this here is when

240
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:46,079
x is larger than one / n and it's

241
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,680
x is always in the interval between zero

242
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,079
and one. And here I'm I'm choosing it's

243
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,120
x minus

244
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:59,600
uh and then 1 /

245
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:03,279
um u n + one

246
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:07,519
right. So you see that if you take

247
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:10,639
x to be 1 / n + one then this here

248
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:13,120
contribute zero. So at this left point

249
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,639
this here is equal it's the function is

250
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,399
equal to one as it should be. And when x

251
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:23,519
here is at the other end point then this

252
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,800
here becomes exactly one over this. So

253
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,240
this whole thing becomes zero.

254
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,720
Right?

255
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:36,240
So if I so this function here I drew is

256
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:40,839
is uh is if you write it down precisely

257
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,839
this is what the function is right

258
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:55,600
and now um now if I'm looking at

259
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:59,680
um if I'm looking at the difference

260
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,720
between uh two such such functions. So

261
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:07,280
for the next one you see the next one

262
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:12,240
here the next one here is so this here

263
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:16,400
is fn right this is how fn look like if

264
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:20,079
I now look at fn + one right this start

265
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:25,039
off being it's zero to the right of this

266
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:27,280
thing here and then it's it's one once

267
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:31,440
you get to

268
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:35,280
n plus2 True. So the next function

269
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,640
looks like this. I don't know if there's

270
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,039
any color chalk, but this thing here

271
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,760
uh is

272
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:47,280
uh that's the next function, right? So

273
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,520
so the the the first function is this

274
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,559
function here. That's a graph of the

275
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:56,240
first function. The next one is like

276
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,720
this one here, right?

277
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:04,720
And so if you're now looking at the

278
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:06,559
distance between FN and FN + one,

279
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,520
right?

280
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,080
The distance here was the soup of the

281
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,480
difference of the two, right? This here

282
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,880
was just the max

283
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:22,200
of uh f of

284
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,200
like this.

285
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:29,280
it was just the max of this right and

286
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,280
now I know that these two numbers is

287
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:37,440
always between zero and one so this max

288
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:41,200
here is at most one right but if I now

289
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:45,120
evaluate it if I now looking at if I now

290
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,400
just evaluate if I'm looking at fn and

291
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,000
now I just evaluate it in in this point

292
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,160
here

293
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,440
in this point 1 / n + one. So if I'm

294
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:02,480
looking at this thing here,

295
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:05,840
f(n) + one 1 / n + one,

296
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,880
you see this value here, this was this

297
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,480
first function here and at this point is

298
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,039
one, right? This here is one,

299
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,120
but for the next one, you see at that

300
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:22,640
point it's zero, right?

301
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:26,160
So this means that this max here is for

302
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:31,440
all n and n + one

303
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:33,679
is actually equal to to one, right?

304
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,799
And so

305
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,600
so now

306
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:47,160
if you look at

307
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:47,160
at um if you look at at the balls

308
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:59,360
So now in particular

309
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,880
if I'm looking at the balls of radius

310
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,320
1/2

311
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,480
suppose I'm looking at the ball of

312
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:09,200
radius 1/2

313
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:12,160
around so this is an open ball so around

314
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,919
fn right because this here is an open

315
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,799
ball so it means that's strictly less

316
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,960
than a half so this means that fn plus

317
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,200
one

318
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:26,720
is not in that ball. Right?

319
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,880
So it's not in sorry it's not in that.

320
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:34,000
Right? And and so now it's easy to see

321
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,720
that all of these balls here are

322
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,360
disjoint.

323
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,200
So all of these balls here will be

324
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,000
disjoint. They're all disjoint. And so

325
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:50,320
if you're looking at if you you can

326
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,880
write uh this initial ball this ball

327
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,200
here this was this close ball that we

328
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,200
started with in beginning

329
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,120
you can write it as uh as a union

330
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:07,039
suppose you write it you can write it of

331
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:09,600
course as a union of half balls

332
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,840
where you take the union over all

333
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,840
centers. plus

334
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,400
all possible centers like this, right?

335
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Because you know this clearly cover this

336
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,440
set because it contains all the centers,

337
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,760
right? But that's already the whole set,

338
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,880
right?

339
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,840
But using this here, you can see that

340
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:38,240
there is not that you can't have finite

341
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:43,679
many of these half balls that cover the

342
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:47,000
whole set. Okay. So using

343
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,000
the functions

344
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,440
fn

345
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,440
uh it follow follows easily

346
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,480
uh that finite in many

347
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,640
many

348
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,640
of these balls.

349
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,720
does not cover

350
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,760
uh and it's uh let me just cover this

351
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,559
here. Why why is this the case actually

352
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,919
sometime you you you put it uh the bar

353
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:37,520
all the way across uh but but I haven't

354
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:40,000
done that. Okay. Why is suppose that

355
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,960
Suppose for a second

356
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,960
that you have

357
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,159
suppose that you have a ball here

358
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,039
uh of a radius a half around some point

359
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,640
then and suppose that you have a

360
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,000
function

361
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,720
g two functions g and h that are in that

362
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,280
bone just ucing that it's a metric

363
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,280
space. So now we have that this thing

364
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,280
here

365
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:20,320
g is strictly less than a half and the

366
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:24,000
distance from uh f to h is strictly less

367
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,240
than a half. So now using the triangle

368
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:30,640
inequality, we conclude that the

369
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,360
distance between this pair here G and H

370
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:37,080
is less or equal to the distance where

371
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,080
you go over F.

372
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,960
And so this here is less strictly less

373
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,360
than a half plus a half. So this is

374
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,720
strictly less than one.

375
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:53,320
So you see from this in particular that

376
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,320
if you take such a ball here

377
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,200
then you can't so it's impossible

378
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,159
to have

379
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,159
that

380
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,159
fn

381
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,960
and fn plus one.

382
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,919
It's impossible to have that they both

383
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,760
are in that ball,

384
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,080
right? Because if they were both in this

385
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,600
ball, then the distance would be

386
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,080
strictly less than one. And we've

387
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:30,080
already seen the distance is is one,

388
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:33,200
right? And this holds not just from for

389
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,440
fn and the next one, but it holds for

390
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,840
like fn. The same argument give that

391
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,159
from fn and any m larger than n. this

392
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,000
this here would be impossible, right?

393
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:49,440
And so from this it follows that you

394
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,600
can't have finitely many that cover the

395
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,760
Yeah.

396
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,520
>> or how do we know that the union of all

397
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,200
of those

398
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,600
functions and like the one

399
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,120
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, so, so this is just and

400
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,039
and this is important because we're

401
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:11,360
going to use this in a minute anyway. So

402
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:14,240
again if you take if you take a set here

403
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:19,279
so if you take a metric space

404
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:21,840
and suppose you take a set subset of X

405
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:25,520
then there's always you know you can

406
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,840
always find a cover even an open copper

407
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,440
um and in particular in a minute we will

408
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:35,039
look at so if you take a here so one

409
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,480
example of an open cover of A is that

410
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,159
you're looking at at the family of

411
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,760
balls.

412
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:48,480
You just pick some radius. R is positive

413
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:50,159
and then you pick centers,

414
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,360
right? But the centers, right? You you

415
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,799
you take the centers, you know, X here

416
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,880
is now anything in A, right? If you're

417
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:05,120
looking at R is fixed, it's positive.

418
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:08,240
X is anything in A. Well, the union of

419
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:12,240
these guys, the union certainly contains

420
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:15,840
the centers, right? So this here already

421
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,600
cover a right and so and we will use

422
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,520
this in just this is like a standard

423
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,360
array to get a cover and then if it's

424
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,039
compact then finally many of those

425
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,640
should cover right okay so in fact let's

426
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:32,640
get to that um

427
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:37,159
so um right so the next thing I want to

428
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,159
prove is um

429
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:47,640
uh is um is is this volano bias version

430
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,640
for a metric space.

431
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,840
So you prove a banal bias theorem for

432
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,159
metric space. Remember that the banana

433
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,159
basis does not hold for every metric

434
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,159
space.

435
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:22,080
for a metric space. So, so now it the

436
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:27,039
bulan visor does not hold for every

437
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:33,559
metric space but it holds. So uh when

438
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:33,559
when this space here is compact,

439
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,880
right?

440
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,200
Okay. So that's what I want to prove and

441
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,400
that's like one of the motivations here

442
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:52,559
and for for the for the definition of

443
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:57,840
being compact. And so

444
00:27:52,559 --> 00:28:03,120
uh let me just remind you. So on RN

445
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:06,159
on R say uh what is the bulani? So on r

446
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,240
the balsano

447
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:14,240
why the what did that say?

448
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:17,799
So this is that any

449
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,799
bounded sequence

450
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,159
has a convergent

451
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,520
subsequence,

452
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,640
right? That was the banana bias assume

453
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:46,320
and and so uh what we want to show here

454
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:50,120
is the following theorem for a for a

455
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,120
general metric space.

456
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,919
So we want to prove the following

457
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:08,840
theorem

458
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:08,840
that if x comma d is a matrix space

459
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:20,039
uh a here

460
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,039
is subset is compact

461
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,120
then any

462
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,360
Then any

463
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,360
sequence

464
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,240
in uh A has

465
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,240
a convergent

466
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,520
subsequence.

467
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,320
Okay,

468
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,760
now let me try to divide it into the poo

469
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:07,080
and let me try to divide it in into some

470
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,080
sub pieces.

471
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,600
So

472
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,039
I begin

473
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,360
with a lema.

474
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,399
So,

475
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,640
so the lema,

476
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,480
so I want to begin with a lema that is

477
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:31,000
the following.

478
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,000
So, I have uh

479
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,039
so I have my metric space.

480
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:47,559
I have um a here is this subset that is

481
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,559
uh compact.

482
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:57,279
And then I have as a a family of nested

483
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:02,120
subsets. So let me just talk about

484
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,120
nested subsets for a second.

485
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:13,640
So I do this on this board. And so what

486
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,640
do I mean by nested subsets?

487
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,880
So, so again I have some set and then I

488
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,000
have some subsets.

489
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:33,039
Um, see

490
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:37,840
it's a it's a it's a family but it's now

491
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:44,320
a family that is uh indexed by the

492
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:50,320
integers. Right? So CI here is subsets.

493
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:53,120
So this is I uh equal to one two so on

494
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,720
and next

495
00:31:53,120 --> 00:32:01,120
I mean in this case here uh I am

496
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:04,320
thinking about that the next subset is

497
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,840
smaller than the previous smaller or at

498
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,519
most equal to the previous. So I have

499
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,080
this

500
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,720
I could also have looked at where they

501
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:20,760
were kind of increasing the subsets but

502
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,760
uh but this is what I have in mind.

503
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,880
Okay. So the sets as as I become larger

504
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,799
the set becomes smaller.

505
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,279
So I have so now back to the lema. Um I

506
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:36,559
have this metric space. I have a compact

507
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,640
subset and then I have a sequence here

508
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,559
of CIS

509
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:46,360
is a sequence.

510
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,360
It's a nested sequence

511
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,760
sequence

512
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,840
of subsets.

513
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,880
So again this means that the next

514
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:03,440
element is contained in the previous

515
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:06,240
one. Right? And this nested sequence of

516
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:10,200
subsets, it's actually a nested sequence

517
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,200
of closed subsets.

518
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:18,640
Closed subsets of

519
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,919
A. Okay, so they're closed

520
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,880
in X and they're contained in

521
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:33,159
in A.

522
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:33,159
And then I assuming that uh and assume

523
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,440
also

524
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:47,440
that the CIS that none of the CIS are

525
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,760
the empty sets. Right?

526
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,240
So I I don't want any of them to be

527
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,720
trivial.

528
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,440
uh then the claim is so the claim is

529
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,559
that

530
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,360
is that if that's the case then actually

531
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:05,440
if you take the intersection of all of

532
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,399
these

533
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,720
this here is is is is non empty so there

534
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:16,320
is something that is in all of the CIS

535
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,839
right okay that's what I want to prove

536
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,320
um and in fact this is

537
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:25,320
quite straightforward Okay.

538
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Um

539
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:33,320
and because

540
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,320
since the so the proof here

541
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,800
since

542
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,800
CI is closed

543
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:50,919
this means that the complement here

544
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,919
is open.

545
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,640
Right. And now for the complements here.

546
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:05,040
So the complement let's call it

547
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:09,920
complements let's call it uh bi.

548
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:13,520
So BI is open again and BI

549
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,720
um + one they actually have this

550
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,599
property that they are because the

551
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,920
previous ones was nested where they

552
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,240
became smaller then when you're looking

553
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,240
at the complements then they become

554
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,240
larger

555
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,440
and uh

556
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:37,040
but uh so since this is closed then we

557
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:40,400
have is uh if

558
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:43,359
the intersection of these CR if there

559
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:48,240
was nothing in the intersection of all

560
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:51,280
of them if this here was the empty set

561
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:54,880
but then it means that

562
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,520
that the complement of these guys would

563
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,359
then cover a right it would actually

564
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,480
right the cover right because there's

565
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:06,920
nothing the union of the complement so

566
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,920
the union of the complement here

567
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,839
it would actually cover X but it would

568
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:17,200
in particular cover

569
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:20,240
A right. So yeah this here called BI.

570
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,280
So you have that.

571
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:27,280
So this mean and again this here is this

572
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:32,760
here is the same as BI.

573
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,760
So now since uh A is compact

574
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,400
since uh A is compact

575
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:52,240
this means that uh A here

576
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:56,599
A here is contained in finitely many

577
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,599
of these let's call them

578
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,960
So you have finally many like this

579
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,440
of the bees and I just you know I'm not

580
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,160
sure whether it's the first but but but

581
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,480
there are finitely many of these that

582
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,480
cover it

583
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:19,200
and so in particular but one of these

584
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:22,480
is like right one of the indices here is

585
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,400
the largest one of those right and so

586
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,119
this means that it's actually contained

587
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:33,359
in the largest of these Let's say that

588
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:36,960
that the largest of these is b right. So

589
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,680
you have this for some n right?

590
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:44,480
But this say but this here remember that

591
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:50,000
this here was the complement of

592
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:53,280
CN like this right. So this means that a

593
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,680
have nothing in CN right. So this mean

594
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:00,400
but A was a sub C was so CN intersected

595
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:04,560
with A

596
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,200
is empty but CN was contained in A. So

597
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:11,280
this means that since

598
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:14,160
cn was assumed to be

599
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,480
uh contained in a right this was subsets

600
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:21,040
of a

601
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:24,160
then this means that cn. So this here is

602
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:30,400
this means that this here then implies

603
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:33,440
that that this thing here is is cn.

604
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,920
Right? So you have that one of them was

605
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:41,560
empty but that we assume that none of

606
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,560
the sets CN was empty. Fine.

607
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,520
Okay. Was that clear? Sorry. Yep.

608
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,240
>> Okay. So that's right. So So I'm I'm

609
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,280
trying to prove uh this theorem here,

610
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:59,760
right? And it it's uh it's not super

611
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,960
complicated, but it's a little bit

612
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,359
involved. And so I'm trying to of course

613
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,280
this is always a great idea if and it's

614
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,800
kind of like important thing in this

615
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,079
class

616
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,599
and and and and also if you take other

617
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,839
math, you know, more advanced math

618
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,760
classes is that when you're trying to

619
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,599
prove something,

620
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,599
it's, you know, there's things that are

621
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,520
really easy to prove, but then there are

622
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,680
things that are much more complicated,

623
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,400
right? So one thing is that you try to

624
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,599
prove it. Another thing is that you try

625
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,440
to explain to other the proof right and

626
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:38,560
so in either case if you can divide it

627
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,720
into substeps right and so this here is

628
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,800
a substep

629
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,000
uh in the proof

630
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,320
and uh and so in a minute we will see

631
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,160
why this here is relevant and so this

632
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,160
sort of answer your question right I

633
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,640
mean how does how does this come up

634
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,520
right and and in a minute you'll see how

635
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,200
it comes up so So, so let me get back to

636
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,880
that question just a minute.

637
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
>> Are you able to explain the last remark

638
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,440
again?

639
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:10,720
>> Yeah.

640
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:13,839
>> So, so here so so again the BIS are open

641
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:17,200
and using compactness because all of the

642
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:19,040
BIS cover a then finally many must cover

643
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,960
it.

644
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,920
But the bis are nested in in this way

645
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,480
that they are increasing as subsets. So

646
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,440
if I'm thinking about maybe this here is

647
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,240
the one where the index is large this

648
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,320
then contain all the other. So this is

649
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,839
it's actually equal to in that case it

650
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,960
would be equal you know this really is

651
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:44,480
equal to like this.

652
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:50,160
So again, so this means that A is

653
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:53,760
contained in in the complement of CN. So

654
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:57,839
in other words, there is no elements

655
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:01,119
in uh in A that are in CN. Right? That's

656
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,440
what it means. So there is no elements

657
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,319
in A that has a CN. This is that this

658
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,240
thing here is empty.

659
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:15,280
But the CN remember that the CN was

660
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:18,880
assumed to be subsets of A. Right? So

661
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:22,560
this means that that there is nothing in

662
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:26,400
CN that is not in A. So this is really

663
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,160
just equal to CN

664
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,880
>> and so is that essentially just creating

665
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,720
a contradiction. Uh and so that's why

666
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,599
and that's a contradiction because now

667
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,839
this show that this one here this CN is

668
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,319
empty but they were all assumed to be

669
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:47,440
non empty right yeah okay

670
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:50,440
so so this is this is like uh yeah Sorry

671
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,440
question.

672
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:07,440
>> Right. Right. Okay. So if

673
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:10,319
so if the intersection of the CI

674
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,280
right so here sorry if they inter so I

675
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:16,880
want to prove this. So I'm assuming that

676
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:21,040
this is the case and I define the BIS to

677
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,760
be the complement of the CIS. So if

678
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:27,599
there is nothing

679
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,240
in the intersection of all of the CIS

680
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:34,960
then it means that the union of the

681
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:37,119
complements must cover the whole set

682
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,800
right because you know right so if you

683
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:44,720
takes anything in even in X if you take

684
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:48,240
anything in X it's not in all of the CIS

685
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:52,400
so this means that there is some I so

686
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:56,680
that it's in complement of that CI right

687
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,680
but that's that's exactly this

688
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,720
um okay so now so you're asking why is

689
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,760
this relevance right and and that's a

690
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,240
good question and uh and I'm not I'm I

691
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,480
will answer it in a minute but I will uh

692
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,160
kind of elaborate I will give you an

693
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,400
example where I have it and then we will

694
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,319
eventually see how to get to that

695
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:25,300
example okay so the next thing is

696
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:26,720
that suppose I take a

697
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,359
[Applause]

698
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:34,319
suppose I have the same setup

699
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:37,920
but now my sets are you know the the

700
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:42,280
then close sets so I have this setup

701
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,280
again so this is like a corner

702
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:51,599
of of the lema that we just pruned

703
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:54,599
so we We have x comma d. This is matrix

704
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,599
space.

705
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:03,560
And we have uh a here is a subset of x

706
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,560
uh is compact.

707
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:12,800
And now now my sets CIS

708
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,040
is going to be so CIS here these are

709
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:19,200
going to be balls

710
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:22,160
of radius R I

711
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:27,440
and center X I

712
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:32,079
and U there would be balls like this

713
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:34,720
and I'm assuming that they are nested

714
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,599
so in the Same way I'm assuming that

715
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,400
this thing here

716
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:43,839
the centers change the radi and the

717
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,160
center change is depending on I they're

718
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:49,440
all this close ball where it's like

719
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:52,400
lesser equal to the eye. So I'm assuming

720
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,720
that the next one is contained in the

721
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,720
previous one.

722
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,200
Okay.

723
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:08,240
And then I'm making one more assumption

724
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,880
is that the RA I

725
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:15,760
goes to zero.

726
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:19,119
Okay. So I have that. So so just let's

727
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,760
observe that these sets here they are

728
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,240
nested by assumption. They're closed,

729
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,599
right? Because it's it's it's it's this

730
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,800
closed ball. So they're closed subsets.

731
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:34,240
Also observe that each of these balls

732
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,000
contain the center. So right so this

733
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,000
means that each of these balls is not

734
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,119
empty. Right? So it's automatic that

735
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,920
they're not empty. Right?

736
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:48,400
Okay. So now I claim that

737
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,880
I claim that the intersection of all of

738
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:55,960
these balls

739
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,960
is is just one point.

740
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:04,599
So now

741
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,599
uh so now the claim here

742
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:15,720
that the uh intersection of these balls

743
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,720
here,

744
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:24,040
these closed balls here

745
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,040
is uh is a single point.

746
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,440
Okay. Yeah. How do we know that each of

747
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,000
balls contain the center?

748
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,960
>> Uh because you know but if you take um

749
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,960
if you take a ball

750
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:52,560
so if you take a ball here in any metric

751
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:57,359
space this is the y in the space in this

752
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:59,599
set. So that the distance from X to now

753
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:03,440
I take the open one but similarly with

754
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:05,599
the closed this thing here is less than

755
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,599
sorry this here is why saying

756
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:09,440
>> it contains its own center but not like

757
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,280
one single point across all

758
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:15,760
>> yeah so that's right so so I'm just

759
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:18,560
saying that so so if you plug in y x for

760
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,920
y right you get zero right so this is

761
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:24,960
definitely so so this here x definitely

762
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:28,079
is in here right and I'm just saying

763
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:30,240
that each of these guys is not empty

764
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,920
right

765
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:37,040
okay so now but and then I want to claim

766
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,280
that actually there's something in the

767
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,040
intersection of all of these balls and I

768
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,280
want to claim that there's only one

769
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,520
thing such thing there's a unique thing

770
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:51,720
that is in intersection of all these

771
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:51,720
balls right okay so now First,

772
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,720
first I want to prove that this thing

773
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,720
here

774
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:05,040
is non right

775
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:09,200
and sorry and this here should have been

776
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:13,319
the closed balls like this but you see

777
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,319
uh this just follows from

778
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,839
from the lema

779
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,359
because

780
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:38,559
each each

781
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:43,079
uh B, you know, because each B R I

782
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,079
XI is closed

783
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,640
and non- empty

784
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:59,200
is each is closed non- empty.

785
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,839
Um and and and

786
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,240
the family

787
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:07,640
or sequence

788
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,640
of of walls

789
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:11,880
is nested.

790
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,800
Right? By assumption, right? By

791
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:22,880
assumption, we assume that this thing

792
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:26,720
here is our i + 1 x i + 1 that this

793
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:30,240
thing here is contained in the previous

794
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:34,720
right. So by assumption by assumption so

795
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:37,599
we again we use the lema and this is the

796
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,559
CIS right and the CIS are closed and

797
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:42,880
they are indeed nested as they should be

798
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:46,160
and they are all non- empty just because

799
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:51,000
they each contain their own centers

800
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:51,000
right I you know yeah

801
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,920
>> we're making some assumption. That's

802
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:04,160
right. We're making some assumption

803
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:08,880
about um right so

804
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:12,880
we're you know and uh uh right we're

805
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,800
making some assumption about that we the

806
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,440
when you when you make this assumption

807
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:20,720
about nested there's some assumption

808
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,880
about the centers the the distance

809
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,839
between centers and there's also

810
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,160
something about the radi that you know

811
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:30,559
how large is one radio relative itude to

812
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:35,680
the other, right? Because if you have if

813
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:38,800
you imagine that this here is BR I

814
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:41,040
like this. This is this. So in the

815
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,520
picture it would be kind of contain the

816
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:47,040
boundary and then the next one but the

817
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:49,599
next one may be out here on the side but

818
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:52,160
it's supposed to be

819
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,319
contained in it.

820
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,559
Right? So you see that the center the

821
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:59,359
sender may have moved. This here was the

822
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,920
XI and the next center may have moved.

823
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:04,400
It may have shifted quite a bit, right?

824
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:08,640
But of course, you know, this here is

825
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:11,680
the RA I radius and this here is the RA

826
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:15,440
I + one radius, right? So you see that

827
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:17,119
there's u there's some sort of relation,

828
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:24,079
right?

829
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:26,480
But okay so so the so we have that the

830
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:29,040
it just follows from the lema that the

831
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,760
intersection of all these closed balls

832
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,720
is non empty right yeah

833
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,599
>> it just follows

834
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:40,319
you

835
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:43,280
>> yeah that's right so it follows now from

836
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:47,119
that I that's why we're using the r= to

837
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:50,000
zero because suppose that you have two

838
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:54,240
elements, right? Suppose that you have X

839
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:58,599
here and Y. Suppose that they are in the

840
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,599
intersection of these guys here.

841
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,960
Right?

842
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,960
Now look at the distance between X and

843
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,000
Y.

844
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:15,040
Well, they are into intersection. So

845
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:18,800
this means that for each I for each I

846
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:24,480
so for each

847
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:27,839
each eye we have that X here and Y

848
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:32,240
is in this guy here.

849
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:36,240
Right? So if it's in in this ball here

850
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:39,640
for for a a I then you can use the

851
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,640
triangle inequality,

852
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:49,040
right? And this thing here is bounded by

853
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:52,400
this here should have been a RA.

854
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:57,599
This here is bounded by less or equal to

855
00:52:52,400 --> 00:53:02,800
because I have this bar RA I plus RA I

856
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:06,720
so 2 R I but it this here holds for all

857
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:09,119
I this here goes to zero. So this means

858
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:12,319
that this here implies as you say this

859
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:15,040
here implies that the distance

860
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:17,119
had to be zero but this is part of what

861
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:20,079
it is means to be a metric space that if

862
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:22,160
the distance is zero then the two points

863
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,040
are the same.

864
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,680
Okay so that was actually so the whole

865
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,480
core was really quite easy from the

866
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:32,480
demo. Okay.

867
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,079
And so now the question is so this is

868
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:40,160
your question is why is this relevant in

869
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,240
in the in this balsano vast stress right

870
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:45,119
I mean there may be not so interesting I

871
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:48,240
mean the lema and color on its own but

872
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:52,680
but it's but there are tools to prove

873
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:52,680
the banana bio

874
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:58,040
okay so let me try to first

875
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,520
explain the idea and then then we go to

876
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:09,839
the proof.

877
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:14,000
So we have

878
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:17,200
we have this matrix space

879
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:21,119
and we have a subset

880
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:25,559
and the subset here is compact.

881
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,559
subset is assumed to be compact.

882
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,680
Then we have a sequence

883
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,480
XN

884
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:37,480
and this sequence here. So this is a

885
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,480
sequence

886
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,880
contained in

887
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,200
in

888
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:57,599
And we want to prove that there exist.

889
00:54:53,200 --> 00:55:00,319
So want to show one to

890
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:03,559
to find

891
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,559
a convergent

892
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,599
subsequent

893
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:14,000
remember that here I mean you know just

894
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,559
that there's no assumption you know I'm

895
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,680
not talking about some cushy complete

896
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,680
set space or something like that right

897
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,480
so in this case I really have to

898
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:27,280
construct the you So I have to construct

899
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,160
the convergence sequence but I also have

900
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,960
to kind of construct the limits right

901
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:35,760
and so this is where or you know like in

902
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,400
particular like the limit this is why we

903
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,400
want this thing here to have a unique

904
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,400
intersection

905
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:47,200
okay so that's what I want to do right

906
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,000
so you you have this uh space you have

907
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:52,400
the subset that's compact and and you

908
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:57,440
are given a sequence

909
00:55:52,400 --> 00:56:00,000
So now I start with um so so and and and

910
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:04,680
before I actually get to the proof let

911
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,680
me just try to explain the idea.

912
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:17,480
So this is this is again this is sort of

913
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,480
uh before the proof

914
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:29,760
So I want to make an observation. So if

915
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:33,599
I am in this s iteration and suppose now

916
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:37,680
that I take so I have a here and I take

917
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:40,000
some r think of r as being really small

918
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:44,319
and then do what we did just did a

919
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:50,319
little while ago. We cover we cover

920
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:53,359
we're looking at A here is covered by A.

921
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:57,200
You can write A as a union of these

922
00:56:53,359 --> 00:57:01,040
balls here where the center is anything

923
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:06,079
in A. Right? So again that cover

924
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:09,960
A and so this means that finally many

925
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,960
that's finally many

926
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,839
many

927
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,680
cover

928
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:17,520
a

929
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:21,319
since

930
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,319
a is compact.

931
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:34,079
So I can write a here

932
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:35,599
as the as uh contained in and then r

933
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,720
uh now I had to be careful because this

934
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:41,680
is not the x probably I should use a y

935
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:46,000
here. Sorry, just to to not confuse it

936
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:50,640
with the sequence that I have. Okay.

937
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:55,319
And so I can I can it's contained in the

938
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:55,319
union of balls like this.

939
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:03,200
YM right is contained in the union of

940
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:05,200
finitely many balls like this.

941
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,920
Okay. So far we haven't used our

942
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:12,079
sequence, right? But now of course I can

943
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:14,720
say that we we we were given a sequence

944
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:18,400
right we now have finally many balls

945
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:20,319
right so and there are like infinite

946
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,200
many elements in the sequence so it

947
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:28,680
means that there is one of these balls

948
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:28,680
finite many balls so for one of them

949
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:35,280
for one maybe more more than one maybe

950
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:38,920
all of them but for at least for one

951
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,920
of these sports.

952
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:47,480
There are

953
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,480
infinite many

954
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,400
elements

955
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,839
in the sequence.

956
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,799
Let me be very precise what I mean by

957
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,720
that.

958
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:06,319
So by that I mean of course this

959
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,160
sequence could be like a constant

960
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:12,480
sequence. What I mean that for

961
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:15,200
infinitely many ns xn is in one of these

962
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:21,559
balls right. So let me just write that

963
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:21,559
out just to be totally clear. So meaning

964
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:28,839
for

965
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,839
one of these balls.

966
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:39,319
There are

967
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,319
infinitely many

968
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:47,000
many ends such that

969
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:53,119
XN

970
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:57,280
is in in that ball

971
00:59:53,119 --> 01:00:01,040
and let's say that this is uh Y3

972
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:04,000
whatever right so there's infin many n

973
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,839
okay

974
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,400
so now

975
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:11,599
I can just think about that one ball

976
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,359
right and I can just think about the

977
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,559
sequence instead of the original

978
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:19,200
sequence I think about a subsequence

979
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:22,000
that is contained in it. Right? So

980
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:25,000
meaning this means that there is a

981
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,000
therefore

982
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,200
there is a subsequence

983
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,680
a subsequent

984
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,920
of the given sequence

985
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:51,000
that

986
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,000
is contained in this

987
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:59,079
in this form.

988
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,079
Okay.

989
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:03,799
Now,

990
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:03,799
um,

991
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,099
[Applause]

992
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:15,200
okay. Now, I want to somehow repeat this

993
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:18,160
process.

994
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:20,400
I want to repeat this process and again

995
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:22,079
I'm I I haven't quite started the proof

996
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,520
here but I'm just trying to explain the

997
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:28,079
idea right so this is like this this is

998
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:31,760
like a step in the proof that you then

999
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:34,960
for the right sort of has to use over

1000
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:37,760
and over again right

1001
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:40,319
and so now

1002
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:44,880
um so I want to repeat this process and

1003
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:48,640
for that I I need to remind you that if

1004
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:52,839
you take um metric space, if you have a

1005
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,839
metric space, so the coin

1006
01:01:55,839 --> 01:02:06,280
that if um

1007
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:06,280
if um x here is a metric space

1008
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:18,760
uh a here is a substance

1009
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,760
a compact subset.

1010
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:34,040
A is a compact subset

1011
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,040
and B here is a closed

1012
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:39,160
set and is a closed subset

1013
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:47,680
of X. Well, then A intersected with B,

1014
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,720
right? The intersection of if it's

1015
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:54,079
compact, it's also it's also closed,

1016
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:56,720
right? We proved that. And so this is

1017
01:02:54,079 --> 01:03:00,640
the intersection of two closed sets. So

1018
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:03,359
this is closed. This is contained in A.

1019
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:07,119
And now we proved last time that if you

1020
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:10,520
take H. So this here is a closed subset.

1021
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,520
This is closed

1022
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:16,079
and is contained in A.

1023
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:19,680
Since A is compact, if you take a closed

1024
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:24,440
subset of A, then this is also compact.

1025
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:24,440
So this is also compact.

1026
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:35,200
Okay. So now

1027
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:38,000
now let's continue

1028
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:41,440
that uh string of thoughts from over

1029
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,280
there. So how do we

1030
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:46,599
now we

1031
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,599
repeat this?

1032
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:56,480
So it's have I have a set I have here

1033
01:03:52,400 --> 01:04:00,559
maybe even bigger. I have here uh this

1034
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:04,319
here is my space x. Then I have some

1035
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:06,720
subset. This here is a

1036
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:10,480
a is compact.

1037
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:13,520
I cover it with balls here

1038
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:16,640
of radius uh and I now have that

1039
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:21,680
finitely many. These are balls of radius

1040
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:24,079
r around some some y's,

1041
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:29,440
right? Finitely many. as fin as many of

1042
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:31,440
these balls and the copper eight right

1043
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,559
then

1044
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:37,680
these sets here are of course not closed

1045
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:39,200
and so I'm looking at

1046
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:42,480
this

1047
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:46,599
ball here these finally many and I just

1048
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,599
take the closed balls

1049
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:53,119
now I want to cover right and and and I

1050
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:55,680
found that for one of

1051
01:04:53,119 --> 01:04:58,640
there was a subsequence that was

1052
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:01,200
contained in fact in the open ball so

1053
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,640
even you know so therefore also in the

1054
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,640
closed ball right there was a

1055
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:08,319
subsequence of the original sequence

1056
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:11,920
that's a ball I'm focusing on right

1057
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:14,640
now this ball I can then cover by balls

1058
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:17,640
of radius so I'm covering this so cover

1059
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,640
this

1060
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,799
by balls

1061
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,480
of radius

1062
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:32,480
uh r over 4.

1063
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:35,119
So I'm going to write this thing here in

1064
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:38,000
the same way. I'm going to write this

1065
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:40,880
this here I now know

1066
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:43,520
um

1067
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,920
this thing here

1068
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:48,400
this thing here I'm only interested in

1069
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:51,760
syncs that are contained in a. So I know

1070
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:55,760
that if I intersect it with A

1071
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:57,680
then this here is is compact, right? I

1072
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,559
know that this is compact. That was

1073
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:02,720
because this here was closed, right? And

1074
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:05,880
and Na was compact, right? So this here

1075
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,880
is compact.

1076
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:17,520
So this means that that if I can write

1077
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:21,200
that set here,

1078
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:27,480
I can write that set

1079
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:27,480
uh as so I can write this set here.

1080
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:38,880
So, so I have so

1081
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:42,640
I have

1082
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,960
so I start with a that is compact then I

1083
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:48,079
find a ball

1084
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:53,200
so that a subsequence is contained in

1085
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:55,760
that ball right this is was that ball

1086
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:57,920
then I'm looking at so this is like the

1087
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:02,240
process I start with here this is step

1088
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:04,640
one step two I looking at this set three

1089
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:07,640
I'm Looking at now the closure of this

1090
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,640
ball

1091
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,720
intersected with a this here is here is

1092
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:19,000
compact.

1093
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:19,000
This here contains a subsequence

1094
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,599
a subsequence

1095
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:29,799
of xn.

1096
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:29,799
This thing here is compact.

1097
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:38,920
This means that I can cover it by balls

1098
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:38,920
of radius. So cover it

1099
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,760
by balls

1100
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,200
of radius

1101
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:53,520
um r over four. I want smaller radius as

1102
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:57,520
I'm going along. Okay. So I'm covering

1103
01:07:53,520 --> 01:08:01,640
it with and in fact I can cover it by

1104
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:01,640
finitely many balls.

1105
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:11,680
Right? Why finite many? This is because

1106
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:14,079
this here is compact. I'm writing this

1107
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:17,279
here as the union of balls of this

1108
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:20,159
radius where anything in this set is a

1109
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:22,480
center. And so I have the finite many of

1110
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:25,480
those cover it right by compactness.

1111
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,480
Right?

1112
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:32,000
And so now what I observe is that if I

1113
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:35,839
take and now I just had to be a little

1114
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:40,000
bit careful. So now I'm observing that

1115
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:42,880
if I take the ball of radius

1116
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:46,319
the double ball

1117
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:50,400
suppose I'm taking this ball here. So I

1118
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:53,920
get finite sorry no before that. So I

1119
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:56,000
have that it's now finitely many balls

1120
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,600
cover this. So this means that a

1121
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,040
subsequence

1122
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:04,560
must lie in one of these balls. Right?

1123
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:07,880
So therefore, so this is the fifth step.

1124
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,880
A subsequence

1125
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:14,679
of the subsequence

1126
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:25,759
lies

1127
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:30,520
in one of these these

1128
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:30,520
these finite many balls.

1129
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,799
of radius

1130
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:46,520
uh r

1131
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,520
over four, right?

1132
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:50,920
And now

1133
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:03,199
now I take so the next thing is I do and

1134
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:08,400
now I want to I want to apply the color

1135
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:13,360
from before. Right. So I started with my

1136
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:17,920
space X. I got this ball here of radius

1137
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:21,440
R and then there was some center.

1138
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:24,400
Then then the next thing is that I get a

1139
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:27,679
ball of radius

1140
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:29,360
uh one

1141
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:33,600
quarter

1142
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:37,199
ah and now this is with you know one of

1143
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:39,679
these other finite many balls where a

1144
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:43,679
subsequence is called it like this uh

1145
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:47,199
maybe like one or something like that

1146
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:50,560
right so I get that so so

1147
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:54,320
The balls of radius R over four they

1148
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:57,520
cover this. So a subsequence actually

1149
01:10:54,320 --> 01:11:00,640
would have to lie here.

1150
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:04,000
Right? And so now but now I want to use

1151
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:07,600
the corner. If I need the to use the

1152
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,880
corner I need to have nested and I need

1153
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:14,880
to have closed sets. Right? And so in

1154
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:17,520
order to make them nested then I double

1155
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,320
I'm I'm going to double this ball. Why

1156
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:24,159
do I double this ball? Well, I double

1157
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:26,960
this ball here because these guys here

1158
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:28,400
cover this, right? But it means of

1159
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:32,480
course that there could be something

1160
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:35,840
outside, right? There could be. So this

1161
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:38,800
is like a ball of radius R.

1162
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:41,679
And so then you have this ball of radius

1163
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:44,400
a quarter R but the quarter balls they

1164
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:48,159
may have some part outside and some part

1165
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:51,679
inside right so so it's not this ball

1166
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:55,760
here is not contained in that ball right

1167
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:58,880
but if you went to the double ball

1168
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:02,159
if you went to this ball of radius 2 R

1169
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:07,440
you see this this point here the center

1170
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:09,679
the the the center here It would lie

1171
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:13,280
right there would be some points in this

1172
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:15,120
ball here that would be within it may

1173
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:19,679
not be the center but there's some point

1174
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:22,320
here that's within R of the center and

1175
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:26,080
then by the triangle inequality any

1176
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:30,320
other points is actually within R2 R

1177
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:33,920
over two of that point. So everything is

1178
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:39,199
comfortably. So this thing here and even

1179
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:42,880
the half ball. So I I can

1180
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:48,120
conclude that even the ball of radius r

1181
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:48,120
over two. Even this one here

1182
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:54,760
is contained

1183
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:54,760
in the double ball

1184
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,080
like that. Okay.

1185
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:07,920
And and in fact if you make things less

1186
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:10,880
or equal to on both things then you have

1187
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:15,280
that.

1188
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:17,679
Okay. Now what I have is at least here

1189
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:21,679
you have

1190
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:25,920
something that is nested. Right. And you

1191
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:28,719
see that the radius went down. Right.

1192
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:33,600
Right. So these are nested and they're

1193
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:37,440
closed. Okay. And so now what we do is

1194
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:39,920
so now we want to do this for a

1195
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:42,480
sequence, right? And then of course we

1196
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,400
want so now we want to construct a

1197
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:46,080
sequence of closed balls like this,

1198
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:49,199
right?

1199
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:53,120
And so and now when you pick your

1200
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:55,040
subsequence, you have to you can't wait

1201
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,960
with picking the first element in a

1202
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,960
subsequence. Right? Remember if you keep

1203
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,600
waiting then you will end up getting

1204
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:04,800
nothing right? So you pick at each stage

1205
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:06,800
you pick one element in a subsequence

1206
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,880
and then when you have the next ball you

1207
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:12,800
pick the next element in a subsequence

1208
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:16,960
and so on right and so

1209
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:19,280
so we will do this with

1210
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:21,120
so we're going to do this procedure here

1211
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:23,440
so now we're getting back to the the

1212
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:25,760
proof of the theorem right and again

1213
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:28,159
remember the theorem was this maybe I

1214
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:31,040
erased it now mistake but the the serum

1215
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:33,040
was this bosano V theorem for a metric

1216
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:35,760
space that you have a metric space you

1217
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:38,320
have a compact subset and you have a

1218
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:40,480
sequence in this compact subset and you

1219
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,080
want to construct a convergent

1220
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:47,679
subsequence.

1221
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:51,640
So, so what you do is there's a proof

1222
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:51,640
of the bulan visor

1223
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,480
for metric spaces.

1224
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:05,040
So, so what you do is so you have this

1225
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:08,480
again a here is compact and you have a

1226
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:11,840
sequence xn this is a sequence that is

1227
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:14,320
contained in a

1228
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:18,239
What you do is that first you can just

1229
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:21,600
let r be equal to one

1230
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:23,600
and then and then you do this you you

1231
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:28,480
cover it

1232
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:31,760
uh by you cover it you have here a and

1233
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:33,920
you cover it by finitely many balls of

1234
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,880
radius one

1235
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,960
and for one of these balls you have that

1236
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,360
there's infinite many element in the

1237
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:44,480
sequence. So you're going to focus on

1238
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:47,679
that ball from here on and out. And you

1239
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:49,280
just pick in your subsequence. You now

1240
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:52,159
pick your first element in the

1241
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:53,840
subsequence to be some element in that

1242
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:58,080
ball.

1243
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:59,600
Then so now the picture is that you just

1244
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:02,880
look at that ball, right? Forget about

1245
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:07,040
the other ball and everything else.

1246
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:09,280
You now cover it by uh balls of radius a

1247
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:13,600
quarter,

1248
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:16,560
right? And you have that again that's

1249
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:19,679
finally many cover

1250
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:22,320
the this this ball intersected with a

1251
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:25,600
finally many cover it

1252
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:27,679
right and so one of them has infinitely

1253
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,480
many elements

1254
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:33,040
in this in in in this sort of

1255
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:35,840
subsequence I consider and so you just

1256
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:38,719
pick one element in that right that's

1257
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:41,280
the next one

1258
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:44,159
and now you Repeat this process, right?

1259
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,159
And so you see that for these balls, but

1260
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:49,040
remember that. So you're starting with

1261
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:52,560
radius one, but you have to double

1262
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:55,600
syncs, right? So the sequence of closed

1263
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:59,679
sets, the initial closed set will have

1264
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:02,560
radius two, right? And the next one

1265
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:05,600
won't have radius a quarter, but it will

1266
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:08,640
have radius two times a quarter. So a

1267
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:10,480
half, right? And the next one will then

1268
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,560
be a ball. It will have a different

1269
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:15,440
center and it will have a radius of

1270
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:19,040
half. And then the next one you see at

1271
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:22,320
each stage when I do it like this then

1272
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:25,440
it go down with a factor of four at each

1273
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:28,400
stage. Right? So this here would be 1 /

1274
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:30,960
8 and so on. Right? And so you see that

1275
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:35,280
this sequence these are are these closed

1276
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:39,440
balls. they are nested as they should be

1277
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:41,760
and the rad goes to zero. Right? So this

1278
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:45,199
means that there is an element that lies

1279
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:48,320
in all of these and that is now the

1280
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:51,360
limit because of the subsequence if you

1281
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:54,400
are from here on and out it will be like

1282
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:56,719
in that ball and from later on and out

1283
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:59,920
it will be in the next ball. Right? So

1284
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:04,040
that intersection of all of these balls

1285
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,040
will be your limit. Yeah.

1286
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:14,880
So, right. So, really what you're

1287
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:17,440
looking at that this thing here

1288
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:20,640
intersected with a

1289
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:23,760
right. So, it's just that these balls

1290
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:26,880
here. So, the intersection here that

1291
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:28,719
these are the the closed sets.

1292
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:32,480
These are the compacts. they are each of

1293
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:35,360
them are non- empty and and they are the

1294
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:38,080
uh the closed subsets of a right so

1295
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:40,719
you're really arguing on these guys here

1296
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:43,440
you see what I mean

1297
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:45,600
I know I stated it for balls in the call

1298
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:48,960
length right but if you just think about

1299
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:51,199
it right the balls play no particular

1300
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:53,520
role except for saying that the

1301
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:55,360
intersection of all of them contained

1302
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,840
just one point and that was because the

1303
01:18:55,360 --> 01:19:00,159
rad went to zero right the important

1304
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:02,320
points were that the sets were closed

1305
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:04,000
subsets, right? Because then there was

1306
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,719
the lema was just all about closed

1307
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:10,120
subset. It had nothing to do with and so

1308
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,120
you see that

1309
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:20,840
that these guys here are closed subsets

1310
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:20,840
of a, right? And so yeah,

1311
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,760
it

1312
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,560
You mean why why I went to double the

1313
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,120
ball? No.

1314
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,480
>> Yeah.

1315
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:38,960
>> Okay. So I So the reason I go to the

1316
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:42,800
double ball is that I want to make sure

1317
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:47,120
that things are nested, right? And and

1318
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:50,640
if I I just did this procedure. Suppose

1319
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:53,120
so again I take this ball here. This is

1320
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:56,480
the first step. I have these balls of

1321
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:59,280
radius one and I find one of them so

1322
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:02,159
that there's infinite many in sequence.

1323
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:05,600
Then I want to have something finer,

1324
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:07,840
right? And so I go to

1325
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,600
I chose because I think you didn't quite

1326
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:11,360
have to do a quarter. You could actually

1327
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,360
have gotten away with a half, but I

1328
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:15,199
thought it wasn't as clear if I I did

1329
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,880
it. So I did it with a quarter because

1330
01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:20,480
then I thought it was it looked more

1331
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:24,239
obvious. So if you now take this ball

1332
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:28,320
here and and as you say you always have

1333
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:31,920
to intersect with a right uh but just to

1334
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:34,560
make things compact but so I cover it

1335
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:38,320
with balls of radius

1336
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:42,400
a quarter right but some of these balls

1337
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:45,040
part of it may lie outside this ball

1338
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:48,480
here right because you know I couldn't

1339
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:51,120
cover you see if I take a ball here I

1340
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:53,199
can't cover it by finally many balls if

1341
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:55,679
I insist you know just if it was like

1342
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:57,520
you clean if I insist that the balls had

1343
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:59,120
to be these smaller ball had to be

1344
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:01,760
inside this ball then there wouldn't be

1345
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:05,120
finite many so I have to kind of look at

1346
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:07,840
balls that where some of these balls is

1347
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:10,159
kind of outside the surface right but

1348
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:12,480
now of course you know so that wouldn't

1349
01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:14,560
really work because it's not like this

1350
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:17,360
ball here let alone the double of this

1351
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:20,480
ball is not contained in this So that's

1352
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:24,800
why I doubled that ball. Then everything

1353
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:26,880
is comfortably contained to each other.

1354
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,280
Any other questions?

1355
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,800
>> Yeah.

1356
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:32,880
>> Isn't there since they're all closed

1357
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:35,360
ball or wait no these are open balls?

1358
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:37,360
>> When I cover things they are open

1359
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:40,400
because I have to have when I have a

1360
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:43,360
compact set I have to cover it by open

1361
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:45,760
subsets. But then once I'm looking at

1362
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:48,000
the nested things, I have to go to the

1363
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,480
closure because otherwise the lema in

1364
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,040
the corner would not apply.

1365
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,880
>> Okay.

1366
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:55,600
>> And if hypothetically though, if they

1367
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:58,639
were closed though, you would be able to

1368
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:00,880
cover like E1 with a

1369
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:04,320
>> and and and I and I'm just saying that

1370
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:06,480
if the the open balls cover it, then of

1371
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:08,800
course their closure also cover it

1372
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:11,120
because the closure is a larger set,

1373
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:14,080
>> right? But you know it wouldn't be

1374
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:15,760
approic clear that you know with you

1375
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,719
know like it's not like you know they're

1376
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:20,800
closed set so that it's not working the

1377
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:23,760
definition. Yeah.

1378
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,679
>> I'm not sure if we prove that like up

1379
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:27,280
there we have like you have a compact

1380
01:22:25,679 --> 01:22:29,679
subset

1381
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:31,440
and take the intersection with subset.

1382
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:32,480
Yeah we prove that it's closed. We prove

1383
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,239
it's compact.

1384
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:37,840
>> We prove that it's compact and I can

1385
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:45,120
prove it again because it's very easy.

1386
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:47,920
So uh so if you take um if you take a

1387
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:50,320
if you have a

1388
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,560
if you have

1389
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:55,040
you have a metric space this here is

1390
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:57,679
compact

1391
01:22:55,040 --> 01:23:01,679
and now you take a subset here of this

1392
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:04,960
here and this here is is closed. It's a

1393
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:09,120
closed subset of X.

1394
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:12,560
Then you look at X take away B. You take

1395
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:15,440
any copper of this together with this

1396
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:18,400
they cover A. But then finally many but

1397
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:21,679
this here have nothing in B. So actually

1398
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:24,639
finally many of the other one cover.

1399
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:28,679
Any other questions?

1400
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:28,679
Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks.
