1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,455

2
00:00:02,455 --> 00:00:05,892
[APPLAUSE]

3
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:10,320

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,740
Good morning, everyone.

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,360
And welcome to MIT Human Insight
Collaborative's annual event.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,340
I'm Anantha Chandrakasan,
MIT's provost.

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,480
And it is great to see
all of you here today.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,880
This is going to
be an exciting day.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,760
MITHIC is about
inspiring our community

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,320
to think differently and
work together in new ways.

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,600
It's about embedding
human-centered thinking

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,080
throughout our research,
innovation, and education.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,960
What you'll see today
is that one year

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,200
in, MITHIC is off
to a strong start,

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,160
advancing work across
the institute that

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,720
broadens our perspectives
on global challenges.

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,420
After the keynote address
this morning from Sloan Dean,

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,510
Rick Locke will have two morning
sessions and two afternoon

19
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,629
sessions.

20
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,390
These sessions will
highlight the remarkable work

21
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,510
sparked or supported by MITHIC.

22
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,410
MITHIC is supporting efforts
like the Compass Initiative,

23
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,190
which you'll hear about
in a little while.

24
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,710
Led by Professor Lily Tsai,
the Compass Initiative

25
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,390
is helping our students
grapple with questions

26
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,150
that don't come
with simple answers,

27
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,390
questions like,
what do we value?

28
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,390
What are our obligations
to each other?

29
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,030
MITHIC is already
complementing the work

30
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,350
of other strategic initiatives,
such as the MIT Generative

31
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,270
Impact Consortium.

32
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,950
You'll hear this afternoon
about the ethical deployment

33
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,670
of artificial intelligence
for healthcare applications,

34
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,550
and the fascinating
work at the intersection

35
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,510
of AI and anthropology.

36
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,380
Along with other
projects that will

37
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,080
be discussed in
today's sessions,

38
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,740
you'll get a clear
sense of MITHIC's impact

39
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,620
that cuts across
disciplines and departments.

40
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,140
When the program wraps up at two
o'clock, we'll have a reception.

41
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,180
I hope you'll stick around and
continue the conversation there.

42
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,700
I particularly want to thank the
MITHIC team for their hard work

43
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,180
to pull this day
together, the faculty

44
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,780
lead Keeril Makan and staff
members Jen Altan and Elena

45
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,714
Nosiglia.

46
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:35,193
[APPLAUSE]

47
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:39,180

48
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,260
I also want to thank the team
in the Office of Innovation

49
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,340
and Strategy, which support
all strategic initiatives.

50
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,820
MITHIC and other
strategic initiatives

51
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,420
would not be possible without
the incredible support

52
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,720
and leadership of
President Sally Kornbluth.

53
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,170
It is really her vision of
what we can accomplish when we

54
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,970
unite our strengths together.

55
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,810
And with that, it is
my distinct privilege

56
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,310
to welcome on stage,
President Kornbluth.

57
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,586
[APPLAUSE]

58
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:15,330

59
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,190
Thanks, Anantha.

60
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,430
I'm actually really excited
to see everyone here.

61
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,550
This is fantastic.

62
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:24,690
And Anantha gave a bunch of
thank yous, which I will echo.

63
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,890
And of course, I have to add to
that a big thank you to Anantha

64
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,100
for all his work and support.

65
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,906

66
00:03:33,906 --> 00:03:39,490
So MITHIC is actually the first
of our truly Institute-wide

67
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,770
initiatives or collaboratives.

68
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,370
And when we launched
MITHIC last fall,

69
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,530
I had talked a lot about
doing big things together.

70
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,450
And I believe that this
is even more important now

71
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,890
than it was earlier.

72
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,250
Because of a suite of
federal actions, which

73
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,840
I know you're all aware of,
universities across the country

74
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,120
are navigating a difficult and
constantly changing landscape.

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,720
And at MIT, we are
doing everything

76
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,160
we can to stay the course.

77
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,560
And I believe that
our best response

78
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,800
to these ongoing challenges
is to just simply keep

79
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,120
doing our very best work.

80
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,279
MITHIC and all of the
presidential initiatives

81
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,000
are a vital part of our
strategy to advance excellence

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,120
within and across
high-impact fields

83
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,700
from health care, climate,
education, AI, manufacturing,

84
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,120
quantum.

85
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,000
And over the past year,
MITHIC has opened up

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,760
an incredible range
of opportunities

87
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,440
for faculty and students
to ask new questions

88
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,080
and arrive at better,
bolder, and more nuanced

89
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,900
answers grounded in the
wisdom of humanities, arts,

90
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,720
and social sciences.

91
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,320
MITHIC also serves
as an inspiration

92
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,670
to a new generation of
philanthropists, alumni,

93
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,790
and friends who want to
join our efforts to drive

94
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,390
new and unexpected
collaborations, the ones that

95
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,270
spark ideas and
solutions that would not

96
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,550
have come about otherwise.

97
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,110
And clearly, this strategy
is beginning to work.

98
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,870
Last fall, we received 89
submissions in response

99
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,670
to our initial call
for MITHIC proposals.

100
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,430
Thanks to support from
alumni friends, all five

101
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,030
schools and the college, we
funded 31 projects representing

102
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,670
22 units across MIT.

103
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,870
And ingenious ideas for research
under the MITHIC umbrella

104
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,470
have continued to flow.

105
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,310
We put out a second call in
September and received nearly 80

106
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,510
more proposals,
which are now being

107
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,390
reviewed for funding in 2026.

108
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,310
And as we keep raising money,
we hope that funding rate

109
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,470
will continue to go up.

110
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,070
The enthusiastic response
shows that there's

111
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,340
an immense desire across
MIT for pioneering research

112
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,420
that blurs the boundaries
between disciplines

113
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,820
and spurs exciting
new collaborations.

114
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,000
So let me just
highlight one example--

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,020
and you'll be hearing
about many today--

116
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,500
the Living Climate Futures Lab.

117
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,740
As you'll hear
today, this lab works

118
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,500
with people and communities
from Massachusetts to Mongolia

119
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,700
who are grappling with
the impacts of climate

120
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,220
change on their daily lives,
on health and food insecurity,

121
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,460
and housing and on jobs.

122
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,540
The lab brings together
environmental scientists

123
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,040
and engineers with
anthropologists, urban planners,

124
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,940
historians, experts in
Indigenous research methods,

125
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,220
and artists.

126
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,700
This amazing array of
knowledge and experience

127
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,700
reflects a very MIT attitude.

128
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,820
If we're hot on the trail of
an important and interesting

129
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,660
problem, we will gladly
ignore all the fences

130
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,710
that typically keep
academic disciplines apart.

131
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,370
Like all of the projects that
are being supported by MITHIC,

132
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,930
the Living Climate
Futures Lab also

133
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,450
embodies MIT's singular brand
of excellence-- collaborative,

134
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,810
hands on, and deeply relevant
to the world and the people

135
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,050
around us.

136
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,690
Before I close, I want to
echo again some of the thanks.

137
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,810
The faculty leaders
who have envisioned

138
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,170
the enormous potential
of elevating the human

139
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,410
centered fields at MIT.

140
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,010
I mentioned Anantha,
but I also have

141
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,010
to mention our Dean
Chastain, Agustín Rao,

142
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,010
and the associate dean
and founding faculty

143
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,430
lead, Carol Macon.

144
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,810
And after all this time, I
think I'm finally pronouncing

145
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,590
your name correctly.

146
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,310
Maybe I can mangle
it a few more times.

147
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,550
But I think I got that right.

148
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,370
And I also want to thank
all of you who are here

149
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,810
to celebrate MIT excellence
across the full spectrum

150
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,170
of human wisdom.

151
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,770
So, speaking of
wisdom, I now want

152
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,480
to introduce you to our
keynote speaker, Rick Locke.

153
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,825
He's the John C Head III
Dean of the MIT Sloan

154
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:57,700
School of Management.

155
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,860
And actually, I would
defy any school,

156
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,840
anywhere to have the dean
of the School of Management

157
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,100
giving the keynote address at
a humanities collaborative.

158
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,040
I think that is
really emblematic

159
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,480
of the interdisciplinary nature
and the institute-wide nature

160
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
of this initiative.

161
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,080
Rick's wide ranging
experience and accomplishments

162
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,060
include serving as the
dean of Apple University,

163
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,960
the provost of Brown
University, and advisor

164
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,880
to organizations from Nike to
the US Department of Labor.

165
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,960
But he began his career at
MIT, earning his doctorate here

166
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,440
and heading up the Department
of Political Science.

167
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,565
Now I've come to know Rick.

168
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:38,523
And, actually, I knew
Rick for a very long time

169
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:40,580
because we were both
provosts at the same time.

170
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,159
And I think we met
every week during COVID

171
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,460
to talk about important
things like masking.

172
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,000
So, we've had a lot
of conversations.

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,470
He's always impressed me with
his intellectual breadth, way

174
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,190
beyond COVID maneuvers
and fresh ideas.

175
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,350
He'll speak to us today
about the human side

176
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,050
of the enterprise-- the
human side of enterprise.

177
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,830
And then he'll sit down
for a chat with Dean Rao.

178
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,291
So please join me in welcoming
back to MIT, Rick Locke.

179
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:12,658
[APPLAUSE]

180
00:09:12,658 --> 00:09:16,990

181
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,330
Good morning, everyone.

182
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,190
And thank you, Sally, for
that nice introduction.

183
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,790
Thank you all for inviting
me to speak with you today.

184
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:29,330
It's a genuine honor to be here
to see some familiar faces,

185
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,350
but also to meet
some new people.

186
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,750
Today, what I'd like
to do is share with you

187
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,890
some early reflections on the
future of management education.

188
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,270
And what I'm going to do
is divide my brief remarks

189
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,830
into three parts.

190
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,950
First, what I'd like
to do is describe

191
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,510
how this is a pivotal moment
for the world of business,

192
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,800
and as a result, for
management education,

193
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,020
given some significant
challenges under way.

194
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,980
Second, as the still
relatively new Dean

195
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,240
of the MIT Sloan
School of Management,

196
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,300
I'd like to offer some thoughts
on how MIT Sloan, by becoming

197
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,060
even more embedded
in the MIT ecosystem,

198
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,540
can lead in addressing
some of these challenges

199
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,700
and in reinventing
management education.

200
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,180
And finally, I'd like to
provide an example of how

201
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,340
we can collectively, all of
us, do this exciting work

202
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,420
by discussing the challenges,
but also the opportunities posed

203
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,980
by generative AI,
and how bringing back

204
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,140
the human side of
enterprise is key to how

205
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,340
we manage this moment.

206
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,500
So let me begin with
the challenges, which

207
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,020
are also opportunities.

208
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,700
In recent years, the context
within which business

209
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,300
has been operating for decades
has changed in significant ways.

210
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,930
Now I'm going to present a
highly stylized description

211
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,390
of that context and
the changes underway.

212
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,890
The reality, of course, is
that's much, much more nuanced.

213
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:05,090
But let me just give you the
less nuanced portrait of things.

214
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,450
Over the last several
decades, business

215
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,770
has operated in a
more or less flat

216
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,410
world where geopolitical
and cultural differences

217
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,690
across countries and
regions were eroding.

218
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,570
A world in which innovations
and communications, logistics,

219
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:26,050
design, and the spread
of global supply chains

220
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:30,530
allowed firms to produce more or
less anything anywhere, usually

221
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,310
driven by low input
and labor costs,

222
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,530
and then sell their
products or services

223
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,450
across the globe in
an array of markets

224
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,430
with little concern for
trade restrictions, tariffs,

225
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,250
cultural barriers, or even
the true cost of externalities

226
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,010
like carbon emissions.

227
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:53,080
Again, this is a very
highly stylized description

228
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,300
of the context.

229
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,340
The world was never as flat as
Thomas Friedman once argued.

230
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,320
It was always much more lumpy.

231
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,520
But the assumption that we were
living in a globalized world

232
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,540
with a more or less
friction-less flow of capital,

233
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,580
of products, of
people, of services,

234
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,200
was one that was shared by many
business and political leaders.

235
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,440
This model of business has
been challenged in recent years

236
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,440
by a variety of
forces, including

237
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,460
the rise of geopolitical
tensions between countries.

238
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,220
And we can talk about
the US and China.

239
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,637
But of course,
it's more than just

240
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:31,160
those two countries
that have led

241
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,800
to the rise of trade barriers
and the reconfiguration,

242
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,220
or even diversification
of global supply chains.

243
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,120
Now that reconfiguration
of supply chains

244
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,740
happened before
the current moment.

245
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,983
It happened during the
first Trump administration.

246
00:12:43,983 --> 00:12:45,400
It happened because
companies were

247
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,570
thinking about their
global carbon footprint.

248
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,990
It happened because of
the pandemic and the need

249
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,530
to have more resilient
supply chains.

250
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:59,670
But recent efforts have really
accelerated this process

251
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:04,670
of trying to reconfigure
and change global trade

252
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,910
and commerce.

253
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,830
The second pressure,
and this is one

254
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,630
that we don't talk
about as much but I

255
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,430
think is equally important, is
the reemergence of regulation,

256
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,830
not just in the EU but in
the US, in different states

257
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,650
and in other countries, as well.

258
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:22,470
Think about the Digital Services
Act or the Digital Markets Act

259
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,370
and what that has done for
especially the digital economy.

260
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,110
This is shaping how companies
make and sell their products

261
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,750
and services around the globe.

262
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,250
Third, there's a
growing awareness--

263
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,190
and I think this is a good
thing-- and concern over climate

264
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,850
change and its
impact on society,

265
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,710
and thus the need to develop
low carbon products and business

266
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,980
practices, business
models in the near future.

267
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,160
Fourth, there are these
emergences of and maturity.

268
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,420
Or maybe not maturity,
but evolution

269
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,820
of disruptive new
technologies like AI

270
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,620
that will impact
existing business

271
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,760
models, work arrangements,
and employment patterns.

272
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,340
And finally, there are changing
employee attitudes towards work,

273
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,980
towards work life
balance, and expectations

274
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,020
they have of their employers.

275
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,380
These and other
challenges threaten

276
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,500
to up-end existing business
models and management practices

277
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,580
in the US and around the world.

278
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,340
I believe that we are
in a pivotal moment

279
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,980
when individual firms and
even entire industries

280
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:33,100
need to rethink their business
models and ways of operating

281
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,200
in the world.

282
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,060
And there is no clear,
already established path

283
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,780
for them to follow.

284
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,940
In enterprises across
the world, leaders

285
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,860
are trying to figure
out how to operate

286
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,950
in a more regulated and
politicized environment.

287
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,810
How to reduce carbon
emissions while still making

288
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,130
innovative products and taking
advantage of their globally

289
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,370
dispersed suppliers
and customers.

290
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,490
How to manage a workforce
with new demands

291
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,270
and new expectations.

292
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:05,250
And how to integrate the promise
and potential of generative AI

293
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,410
into existing and future product
services and business models

294
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,210
in ways that will increase their
company's competitive value

295
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,010
and not undermine it.

296
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,290
And the sad truth is that
most management schools,

297
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,490
business schools, cannot guide
these leaders since we, too,

298
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,290
are stuck in the past.

299
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,050
To be completely frank, most
management business schools

300
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,330
have been teaching
the same material

301
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,930
in the same way for
decades, not adapting

302
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:39,010
our models, our frameworks,
and our theoretical approaches

303
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,730
to the dramatic changes
underway in the world.

304
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,390
And the students know it.

305
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,380
And so do their
future employers.

306
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,680
Now, I don't expect
this crowd to be

307
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,380
a regular reader of a magazine
called Poets and Quants.

308
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,920
This is a magazine that
talks about business schools.

309
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,280
But last late July, an article
came out in Poets and Quants

310
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,640
basically quoting all these
business school students

311
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,660
at Graduate School of
Business at Stanford,

312
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,368
where the students
were basically saying,

313
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:09,060
we're not learning anything.

314
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,860
We're not learning any skills.

315
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,160
About a month ago, a similar
article in the same magazine

316
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,480
came out about Wharton,
where they basically

317
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,725
argued the same thing.

318
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:19,600
These professors are
teaching the same things

319
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,225
that they've been
teaching for decades.

320
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:23,380
We're not learning
any new skills.

321
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,780
Now I was, as the
new Dean of Sloan,

322
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,680
greatly relieved that they were
writing about others and not

323
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,080
about us.

324
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,700
But the fact is, they could
have been writing about us.

325
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,420
This is an industry problem.

326
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,200
This is not a school or
particular university problem.

327
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,550
And this is something that
we have to take on head-on.

328
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,190
But I believe that these
and other broad challenges

329
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,670
create exciting
opportunities for MIT Sloan

330
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,330
to build on and expand
its unique assets,

331
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,270
to play a leadership role in
addressing these challenges,

332
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:02,870
and in the process, reinvigorate
management education, management

333
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,182
research, and practice.

334
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:06,890
Now, I know this sounds
like a sales job.

335
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,550
But I really, actually,
really believe it.

336
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,849
So why Sloan?

337
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:14,990
Why do I think this is such a
great moment for MIT and MIT

338
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:15,730
Sloan?

339
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,490
And I believe it's because we
possess several amazing assets.

340
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,550
The first is that
we have a world

341
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,310
class, research-oriented
faculty, many of them already

342
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,250
working on some of the
important issues of the day,

343
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,490
whether it's health or climate
or advanced manufacturing,

344
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:35,490
or the future of work or GenAI
or any of the other key issues.

345
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,070
We have people already
working and collaborating

346
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,470
across the university
on these issues.

347
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,680
We have amazing faculty,
incredible students,

348
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,700
and an incredibly dedicated
professional staff.

349
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,300
And our curriculum
has traditionally

350
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,720
blended theory and
practice, hand in mind,

351
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,120
which is exactly
how adults learn.

352
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,740
So we have these incredible
assets in our people

353
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,260
and in the curriculum
that we have already.

354
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,540
Secondly, and this is the most
important asset I think we have,

355
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,860
is our embeddedness in MIT
and in the MIT ecosystem.

356
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,460
Across this great
university, colleagues

357
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,020
are conducting
cutting edge research

358
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,060
on some of the key challenges I
described earlier, whether it's

359
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,160
climate change, health care,
advanced manufacturing,

360
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,980
generative AI, and so much more,
by becoming even more embedded

361
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,400
in this ecosystem.

362
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,480
And what does that mean?

363
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,240
What it means is more
collaborative research,

364
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,900
more collaborative teaching.

365
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,540
Between Sloan and the
rest of the institute,

366
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,780
I believe that MIT Sloan can
help translate innovations

367
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,350
in these and other areas
into new enterprises,

368
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,270
into new business models,
into new policies,

369
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,250
into new ways of thinking about
the world and the economy.

370
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,130
This is Sloan's role
in the MIT ecosystem,

371
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,570
is to play that translational
management role.

372
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,710
And let me just
elaborate on this.

373
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,930
As I said, MIT's Sloan
faculty already very

374
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,910
actively involved in many of
the presidential initiatives.

375
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,510
When I think about the GenAI
or climate, even MITHIC,

376
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,090
we have Sloan faculty who are
involved in either the steering

377
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,790
committees or
co-leading these things.

378
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,870
And this is great.

379
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,550
This is a way that we're
bringing people together.

380
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,850
But we can do so much more.

381
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:25,650
And the way that I think about
this is, how can MIT Sloan lower

382
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,050
the barriers so that students
from all over the institute

383
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,930
can take our courses,
maybe even earn a degree?

384
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,410
How can MIT Sloan
begin to develop

385
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,570
with other parts of MIT
cutting-edge certificate

386
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,160
programs or other
courses of study

387
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,720
where we're bringing together
people from engineering

388
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,120
and science and
humanities with Sloan

389
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,660
to actually address some
of these big issues?

390
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,040
I think there's so
much that we can do,

391
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,240
which is not only
good for MIT, but it's

392
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,360
a way of really reimagining
management education

393
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,040
and management research.

394
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,520
Now when I think
about this, I think

395
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,360
about increasing MIT'S Sloan's
embeddedness within MIT means

396
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,440
more than simply deepening the
ties between, say, the technical

397
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,600
and the commercial
sides of campus.

398
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,400
It also requires that MIT
Sloan work more closely

399
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,480
with colleagues in SHASS and
reinvigorate its long standing

400
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,960
tradition focused on the
human side of enterprise.

401
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,480
As many in this room
may or may not know,

402
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,280
MIT Sloan has a long and
distinguished history

403
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,560
of focusing on the human
dimensions of business.

404
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,760
In its early days during
the post-war boom,

405
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,150
the US enterprise,
as US enterprises

406
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,150
were growing and
trying to figure out

407
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,270
how best to engage and
motivate their employees,

408
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,910
Sloan Professor Douglas
McGregor published

409
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:51,530
an important book called The
Human Side of Enterprise.

410
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,410
It was published in 1959.

411
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,070
And in that book, McGregor
outlined Theory X and Theory Y,

412
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,630
opposing theories
describing why people work

413
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,490
and how they should be managed.

414
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,230
Theory X assumes that workers
are inherently unmotivated.

415
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,790
And this leads to a
top-down style of management

416
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,050
based on compliance
and a mix of carrots

417
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,830
and sticks to reward
or to punish employees.

418
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,390
Theory Y, on the
other hand, assumes

419
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,910
that employees are intrinsically
motivated to do their best work

420
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,750
and to contribute to the
organizations that employ them.

421
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,610
This leads to a very
different management style,

422
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,870
one that empowers
workers, that gives them

423
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,070
greater discretion
over their jobs,

424
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,540
and cultivates higher
levels of engagement.

425
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:46,500
McGregor was only one of a
long list of MIT Sloan faculty

426
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,900
who worked on this more
human-centric approach

427
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,120
to management.

428
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,260
And I think of the
work of Lotte Bailyn

429
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,120
or Ed Schein on organizational
culture, or of Tom Kochan,

430
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,980
Bob McKenzie, and Paul
Osterman on what they called

431
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,940
high performance work systems.

432
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,980
They fall clearly
in this tradition.

433
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,740
I see my own research on labor
standards and global supply

434
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,160
chains following this tradition.

435
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,700
And faculty and students
in what Sloan now

436
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,640
calls the Work in
Organizational Studies group,

437
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,240
continue this important
line of research,

438
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,820
as do our colleagues at the
MIT Leadership Center, which

439
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,700
is also based on Sloan.

440
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,760
And so for Sloan to deepen and
expand and expand this work,

441
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,500
we need to increase
our collaboration

442
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,880
with colleagues in SHASS
and across the institute.

443
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,780
And this is why MITHIC
is so important for MIT,

444
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,690
but also so important
for MIT Sloan.

445
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,690
I believe that tapping into all,
every part of MIT, everything

446
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:49,410
that has MIT to offer, would
help MIT Sloan chart the future

447
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,250
to shape how new
technologies like AI

448
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,030
will reconfigure
industries and careers,

449
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,030
how new enterprises
will be created and run,

450
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,390
how individuals
will work and live,

451
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,570
how business practices will
become more sustainable,

452
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,190
and how national economies
will develop and adapt.

453
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:10,890
It's an incredibly exciting
time to be at MIT--

454
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,770
to be back at MIT.

455
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,070
So let me illustrate--

456
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,450
And I'm almost done.

457
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:19,050
Let me illustrate how we can
together do this important work

458
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:22,450
by highlighting some important
research on GenAI that

459
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,090
is already taking place at
both MIT and at MIT Sloan.

460
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,810
Now as you all know,
Americans today

461
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:33,330
are both ambivalent
and anxious about AI

462
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,840
and its impact on their
jobs, on the economy,

463
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,240
and on society as a whole.

464
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,080
Many see opportunity.

465
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,480
62% of respondents in
a recent Gallup survey

466
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,860
believe that AI will
increase productivity.

467
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,600
53% believe that it will
lead to economic growth.

468
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:59,120
But still, 61% of respondents
in this Gallup survey

469
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,740
think that AI will destroy
more jobs than it will create.

470
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,280
And nearly half, 47%
of the respondents,

471
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,680
think that it will
destroy more businesses

472
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,520
than it will recreate.

473
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,360
These are real concerns
from an anxious population

474
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,720
voiced at a time of great
economic and political

475
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,040
uncertainty.

476
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,280
This is a critical moment,
with enormous consequences

477
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,200
for the workforce, for
organizations, and for humanity.

478
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,280
And as the latest generation
of artificial intelligence

479
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,280
leaves its nascent phase, we
are confronted with a choice

480
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,590
about which path to take.

481
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,070
Will we deploy AI to
eliminate millions

482
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,150
of jobs across the economy?

483
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,350
Or will we use it to
empower the workforce

484
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,670
and enhance our
human capabilities?

485
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:50,550
Fortunately, colleagues
at MIT and MIT Sloan

486
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:53,910
are already doing important
work to show the viability

487
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,430
of the second path.

488
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,650
For example, in their 2023
book, Power and Progress,

489
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,350
Daron Acemoglu and
Simon Johnson argue

490
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,550
for recharting the
course of this technology

491
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,990
so that it promotes shared
prosperity and complements

492
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,470
rather than substitutes
for the work of humans.

493
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,730
Writing later with another
MIT colleague, David Autor,

494
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,390
the pair argue that the
direction of AI development

495
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,830
is a choice, and argue
that leaders and educators

496
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:28,790
must choose a path of
machines in service of minds.

497
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:32,430
But what does this mean in the
context of today's workforce

498
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,570
and workplace?

499
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:36,540
How do we create
organizations and paths

500
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,220
that travel this human
centric, worker friendly path?

501
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,300
Part of the answer
lies in research

502
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,060
from MIT Sloan Professor
Roberto Rigobon

503
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,740
and postdoctoral
researcher Isabella Loaiza.

504
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:56,460
These scholars analyzed 19,000
tasks across 950 job types

505
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,180
and found five human
capabilities that are increasing

506
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,820
in value as AI advances.

507
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,480
These are empathy, presence,
opinion, creativity, and hope.

508
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,980
This Epic framework points us
on a path towards upskilling

509
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,900
workers, with a
focus on what they

510
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,540
call the fundamental
qualities of human nature.

511
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,860
These are simply a
few of the examples

512
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,160
of the exciting and important
work taking place across MIT.

513
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,320
There's so much more
work taking place,

514
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,740
but work that allows
us to see the choice

515
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,740
and begin to imagine how we
take that second choice that

516
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,610
enhances our humanity
and empowers people.

517
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:39,810
This work suggests that job
loss and de-skilling are not

518
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,810
inevitable outcomes
in this new era of AI.

519
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:47,050
From Theory X and
Theory Y to Rigobon

520
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,830
and Loaiza's important work--

521
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:54,890
I've now lost my notes--

522
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,770
I'll find them.

523
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,690
Here it is.

524
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,290
Insightful, epic framework to
the new educational paradigms

525
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,930
made possible through
initiatives like universal AI

526
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:09,370
that was recently released
by the MIT Open Learning

527
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,370
Initiative.

528
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:16,650
MIT and MIT Sloan have a history
of charting and paving pathways

529
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,650
to an exciting and
productive future of work

530
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,290
that not only includes
humans, but makes

531
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,410
the most of our humanity.

532
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,397
Together, we can
invent this future.

533
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:28,230
Thank you very much.

534
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,580
[APPLAUSE]

535
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,000
