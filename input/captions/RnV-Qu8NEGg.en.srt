00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Before my first launch, I I asked many

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,240
of the astronauts who had already flown,

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,680
you know, what's it going to be like? I

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,160
mean, every rocket has its own

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,240
characteristics. With with the shuttle,

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,840
it was those two big solid rocket

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,679
boosters that cause all of the

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,520
vibration. And they they burn for the

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,600
first 2 minutes. I remember thinking to

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,080
myself, "No, this can't be normal.

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
Something's wrong." But, I mean, the

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,840
structural engineers knew what they were

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,920
doing. ever since I was 6 years old and

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,039
I saw Flash Gordon take off in his

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,960
rocket ship in in science fiction and I

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,440
always dreamed of doing it and and I'm

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,760
about to uh you know leave the planet.

18
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,920
It was it was exciting you know sit back

19
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,760
and enjoy the ride. I I'm not a pilot so

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,360
I didn't have to even worry about flying

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,600
the shuttle. I could just look out the

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,039
window and enjoy this incredible

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,960
experience which it certainly was.
