9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,680
>> Today is pretty much just set aside for

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,160
brainstorming. So, we're probably going

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,920
to do about an hour of that uh just to

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,599
like throw the ideas that people already

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,280
have in their heads about what could be

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,200
with the problem space that we're

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,160
working on. I mean, this this whole

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,280
preparing people to deal with violence

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,079
uh and uh uh with with folks suffering

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,280
from mental uh illness and you know

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,320
there's a whole bunch of different

20
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,239
things that people might be interested

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
in working on. And the idea is that we

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,680
hope hopefully if we can get this all

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,000
out then um that we can spend next half

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,440
hour and frankly the rest of this week

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,199
uh trying to figure out who's in which

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,440
team uh you know who's who's

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,840
collaborating on similar topics and

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,320
who's interested in working.

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,880
Um and did anyone actually manage to get

30
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,200
through any of the readings that I had

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,240
put up? Okay. Right. So so there's a few

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,159
things in there. I realized there wasn't

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,600
a whole lot of time to read uh to read

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,560
and there's probably more stuff up there

35
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,840
to read than it needs to be necessarily

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,680
but it's all there as resources any any

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,200
ideas that people thought might be

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,560
interesting to work on uh going uh

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,560
Andrew and then

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,159
>> so one of the basic issues I heard from

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,360
the presentation and papers was

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,479
communication

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,159
>> so I guess uh the brainstorm simulation

44
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,360
but the real world system would be

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,240
communication between the psychiatrist

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,960
and the like the

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,799
>> patient patient

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,280
>> patient yes the patient along with the

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,079
psychiatrist with the person uh above

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,079
them

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,920
>> psychiatrist patient communication

52
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,960
>> yes

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,360
>> what's I for what they call

54
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,680
>> patient

55
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,439
>> person not the patient but patient

56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,640
psychiatrist person

57
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,040
>> orderly

58
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,960
>> nurse

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,439
>> what what function do they have

60
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,799
>> give us more information our system is

61
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,679
under constraint

62
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,200
>> mind psychiatrist patient for Yeah. But

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,200
>> but I mean you're not talking about

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,080
psychiatrist nurse patient.

65
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,920
>> No, it's like uh

66
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,520
>> psychiatrist resident.

67
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,720
>> Sorry. Maybe like nurse patient and then

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,480
nurse reporting instant to

69
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840
>> supervisor. Three levels. So

70
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,800
>> yes, that's the one.

71
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,760
>> So like you have a supervisor,

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,879
>> you have a nurse.

73
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,319
>> Yeah. Sorry guys.

74
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,760
>> And you have the patient. Like those

75
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,800
kind of like reporting up, reporting

76
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,519
down. Great.

77
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,080
>> All right. Uh yeah. So I have a couple

78
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,239
ideas. One of them was maybe an idea

79
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,680
like uh you have there's a patient and

80
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,879
there's two uh I guess doctors

81
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,360
psychiatrists

82
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,879
>> and so one one psychiatrist is one

83
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,480
psychiatrist is trying to calm the

84
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,640
patient while the other is doing the

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,800
opposite and trying to make this patient

86
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,120
as angry as possible. So the way I'm

87
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,519
thinking is with the one that makes you

88
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,680
the psychiatrist is trying to uh enrage

89
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,200
the patient that's kind of training in

90
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,040
what not to say

91
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,720
>> while the patient or the doctor is

92
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,760
trying to calm them down is

93
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,560
>> so so by showing how you can how what

94
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,560
was the worst possible way to get

95
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,120
>> Okay. So I couldn't call that good bad

96
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,760
cup.

97
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,519
>> Yeah. And then another idea I I had

98
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,760
which I thought with bashing yesterday

99
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,640
was um maybe have like have a team of

100
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,000
psychiatrist working with one patient.

101
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:34,239
But in interace in one of the uh

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,720
psychiatrist is like a saver trying to

103
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,560
is trying to enrage the patient.

104
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,400
Remember the target audience is going to

105
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,280
be psych like actual residents in so so

106
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,640
so but but I'm going to like I I I just

107
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,959
going to say several and a group

108
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,959
>> of psychiatrists

109
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,920
maybe an idea of the dynamic that we can

110
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,040
play with. Okay. Uh John

111
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,799
>> uh so three quick things. One would be

112
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not exactly sure how this fits into

113
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,159
a game, but uh simulating people who are

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,680
delusional schizophrenic by either

115
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,439
having every player have a a separate

116
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,040
like audio track playing in their ear as

117
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,400
they play. So there's like voices

118
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,720
speaking to them and they have different

119
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,040
audio experiences or having just one

120
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,000
speaker that everyone can hear that uh

121
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,360
that is playing audio. just

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,360
incorporating audio into the experience

123
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,720
to simulate in some way the internal

124
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,840
thought process and perhaps these

125
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,120
delusional thoughts that sort of you

126
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,800
know the voice that tells you to go kill

127
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,000
your mother and whatnot which isn't you

128
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,440
know documented issue

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,560
>> now this particular game doesn't have to

130
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,680
be a board game doesn't have to be a

131
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,600
card game you have a lot more

132
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,440
flexibility on how what what you want to

133
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,960
do I would suggest steering away from

134
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,840
doing anything that requires digital

135
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,800
logic like uh you know but you know MP3

136
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,720
players will be

137
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
>> right exactly so something like that um

138
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,280
so that's the first idea second thing

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,800
would be a board game where you're in

140
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,120
charge of managing a ward it's just a

141
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,840
logistical making sure that you don't

142
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,240
leave anyone neglected or or forget.

143
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,639
>> Oh, definitely. Okay. So, yeah, people

144
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,759
will

145
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,680
>> So, you know, patients have their

146
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,960
favorite nurse, you know, and they have

147
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,880
sort of hidden issues that you have to

148
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,240
uncover and and deal with. And if you

149
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,360
leave something unattended and someone,

150
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,720
you know, goes over, then they become

151
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,720
violent. And so, you're kind of trying

152
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,440
to make sure. And the the third idea

153
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,520
would be to have uh one player pay as

154
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,520
the patient and to simulate the their

155
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,600
inability to communicate properly for

156
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,039
whatever reason. the information of

157
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,080
their own condition is hidden hidden

158
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,199
from the player. And so, um, try to

159
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,479
create a game experience that is

160
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,080
genuinely frustrating because the the

161
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,280
the player doesn't quite know what's

162
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,639
wrong with them and can't articulate it

163
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,400
properly and the other players are in

164
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,840
charge of of finding it out and creates

165
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,960
some sort of time constraint thing. So,

166
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,320
it gets heated and and like

167
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,919
>> there are a bunch of improv games that

168
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,360
are exactly that. It's like I have

169
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,400
something about me, but I can't tell you

170
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,600
what it is.

171
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,120
>> But, but you know, if the player doesn't

172
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,800
even know that, it can get really

173
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,240
>> right. Yeah. That's like the game where

174
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
you have I can't remember what it's

175
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,320
called, but the one where you have you

176
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,560
try to make the other person say a word,

177
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,560
but you can't use a certain series of

178
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,560
like

179
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,000
>> I just wanted to say on the simulating

180
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,319
schizophrenia with audio tape.

181
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,240
>> Um I've been part of RPGs which have

182
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,840
done that well. So like live action role

183
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,960
playing stuff which did which did it

184
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,720
really well. It actually works. So um I

185
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,840
recommend that it's actually quite

186
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,520
>> exploring that further.

187
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,720
>> Yeah. I mean it's been tried in a

188
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,080
setting which I've seen before and

189
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
worked really well. So I think it could

190
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,520
work out.

191
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,160
>> Mhm.

192
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,840
>> You can do a refinement on that idea.

193
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,160
>> Uh

194
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,440
>> um so I know one of the main things that

195
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,759
he was talking about is like knowing

196
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,120
what to do and like just having the like

197
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,800
going through the process of like what

198
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,880
happens when somebody does something.

199
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,720
And so that brought to mind like D and D

200
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,479
and how like you have to prepare before

201
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,759
the encounter and then in the encounter

202
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,400
like you have certain actions that you

203
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,479
can do like calm through speech, calm

204
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,800
through, you know, presenting some

205
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,199
object or some idea or whatever. Uh

206
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,840
which I think would map pretty easily to

207
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,600
the D&D space. Um and then you could

208
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,199
also like you know you have certain

209
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,120
abilities that are natural to your

210
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,880
character like you're very charismatic

211
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,520
which makes some things easier and such.

212
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
I think that

213
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,039
>> so

214
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,800
>> so simplified D and D to um to handle

215
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,840
interactions with patients.

216
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,240
>> So so tabletop RPG style,

217
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,680
>> right?

218
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
>> And the kinds of things that you wanted

219
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,759
to emphasize were things like

220
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,960
preparation uh and sort of playing out

221
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,759
your actual skills,

222
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,280
>> right?

223
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,919
>> You know the things that you're good at,

224
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,479
right?

225
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:31,319
>> So natural skills

226
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,319
and uh preparation

227
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,280
All right. So, I kind of had an idea for

228
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,599
a game that could potentially be a card

229
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,800
game where the player who's playing as

230
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,800
the patient and the player who's playing

231
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,479
as the doctor are operating under

232
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,599
different rules. And one of the main

233
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,039
points of the game is that they don't

234
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,720
act they're not actually aware of the

235
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,319
other player's rules. So, for instance,

236
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,080
the patient could have certain goals

237
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,240
which he's trying to achieve,

238
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,160
>> but he is unaware which of these goals

239
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,120
is like completely unreasonable to the

240
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,280
doctor. And the game, the doctor has

241
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,720
certain actions he can take and and is

242
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,360
unaware which of these are going to be

243
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,720
threatening to the patient. And so there

244
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,160
there could be an instance where the

245
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,319
patient actually believes the only way

246
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,840
he is capable of winning the game is by

247
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,800
using violence. And so that could be one

248
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,080
of the end conditions,

249
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,800
>> right?

250
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,080
>> So So sure and then you you kind of have

251
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,039
to did you

252
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,960
again to

253
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,479
>> uh I really like the idea that uh a

254
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,680
psychiatrist has to really keep their

255
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,960
composure when they're dealing with a

256
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,160
violent person. they can't raise their

257
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,319
voice, they have to keep them a certain

258
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,120
distance and they can't uh you know seem

259
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,039
upset for whatever reason. So a sort of

260
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,320
a party game idea, you could have, you

261
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,839
know, two people um basically one person

262
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,519
would just have to be throwing insult at

263
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,200
the other person and the person who's

264
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,800
receiving the insults would just have to

265
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,240
stay calm the whole time and continue

266
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,440
talking, which is really hard to do even

267
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,839
if you know it's coming at you.

268
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,600
>> So like keep your cool. I mean that that

269
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,360
that could be a game where you're like

270
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,680
literally insulting someone or it could

271
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,600
be a thing where you're playing a

272
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,120
character with a certain amount of like

273
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,240
composure points or something like that

274
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,680
and you know you're sort of like

275
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,720
planning actions to try to maintain

276
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,000
those

277
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,800
>> uh and different tactics to be able to

278
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,240
increase those or decrease those

279
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,920
>> back uh co-op type game where you are a

280
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,360
bunch of nurses trying to basically take

281
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,000
care of the ward. So, it's a lot like

282
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,240
Jeremy's uh Diner Dash style game,

283
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,519
>> except you have a limitation to how many

284
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,440
you can actually do at once. So, you

285
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,240
will be forced to neglect one every so

286
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,760
often.

287
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,720
>> Patient one neglect one patient, one

288
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,320
patient, one

289
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,560
>> some nurses will get sick and they'll

290
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,560
have to leave.

291
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,200
>> So, so or or rather you have limited

292
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,560
resources uh not quite nearly enough to

293
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,760
deal with every single crisis that's

294
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,640
going to happen.

295
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,240
>> Okay. Um, so I the one thing that I kind

296
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,040
of found interesting in like reading the

297
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,440
stuff is that statistically the amount

298
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,360
of violence that happens like with

299
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,640
mental patients is is not actually like

300
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,680
that different from the amount of

301
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,560
violence that happens in general

302
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,399
population.

303
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,399
>> Um, and you know they talked about how

304
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,080
like people going through this and like

305
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,360
deciding to go into the profession might

306
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,560
actually second guess themselves because

307
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,320
they have this perception that there's

308
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,560
more violence. So I think like

309
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,600
incorporating something where you have

310
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,320
um life in the ward and life outside of

311
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,760
it to just like so you you incorporate

312
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,680
both the things where you're trying to

313
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,200
deal with the patients but you're also

314
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,800
reinforcing this idea that like it's not

315
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,800
it's not like significantly more

316
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,079
dangerous than real life is.

317
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,279
>> None of your patients stab you then you

318
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,200
get in your way home.

319
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,720
>> Yeah. Like something like that like you

320
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,560
know it's it's just life. I mean I mean

321
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,240
one thing one thing that would give you

322
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,000
the uh you may put it up one one thing

323
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,399
that could be really attractive is that

324
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,800
that now broadens your audience to

325
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,920
people who aren't just

326
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,640
psychiatric

327
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,959
>> right

328
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,600
>> so I like the idea of the patient and

329
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,640
doctor having different rules goals

330
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,600
triggers etc. Um, but I also like the

331
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,160
idea of incorporating like an escalation

332
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,600
and deescalation into the conflict

333
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,600
between the two of them.

334
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,040
>> So I feel like part of the thing which

335
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,160
was really compelling about the role

336
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,680
playing scenario that they showed was um

337
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,320
there was there was the sense in which

338
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,160
the doctor can say things which can

339
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,839
escalate or deescalate this the

340
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,839
situation, right? Make it more or less

341
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,399
likely that things will go in a good or

342
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,320
bad way. And like one way which we could

343
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,760
do which that could be done in partially

344
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,200
through roles would be to have like

345
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,959
hidden keywords which the um which the

346
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,480
patient responds to or what have you and

347
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,120
that kind of moves them into a different

348
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,360
state and then like transitioning

349
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,680
between these two states um changes the

350
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,720
goals which the the patient has. They

351
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,200
may be intent upon trying to get nurse

352
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,360
what was the name nurse's name Dave or

353
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,640
>> nurse John but for that as they get

354
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,000
deescalated then they just want to

355
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,600
change their meds but then as they get

356
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,160
dis

357
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,079
um deescalated from that they may just

358
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,360
want to go home or something like that

359
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,920
>> just coming up with the rules that model

360
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,360
what an unreasonable patient

361
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,760
>> Yeah. Yeah.

362
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,639
to give up or or what would be he

363
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,480
willing to give up

364
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,320
>> and and and actually putting somebody in

365
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,000
the shoes of that is actually really

366
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,399
useful to sort of think about what I can

367
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,639
do as a doctor.

368
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,399
>> Uh so there was this game I used to play

369
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,839
in my family where like you're given a

370
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,240
scenario and like a certain number of

371
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,160
words that you can't use but like you

372
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,160
want someone to like guess them. So

373
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,240
essentially like it's like you choose

374
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,360
random words and you have a scenario and

375
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,560
like very similar to what you were

376
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,320
saying where like certain keywords do

377
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,480
certain things but like you have to you

378
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,920
have to somehow create like the best

379
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,480
story or the best like calm down like

380
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,880
passage to read to the patient and then

381
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,040
like there's some arbit like arbitrator

382
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,440
like the GM of the game that like

383
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,959
decides like which of the three people

384
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,720
that were playing like which one had the

385
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,959
best story out of those um to sort of

386
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,880
get you to like have to come up with

387
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,959
something to deal with like you know you

388
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,160
need nurse John right away. Best way to

389
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,240
deal with that for

390
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,320
>> I mean you you you could do a thing

391
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,079
where you had to create a story out of a

392
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,399
randomized collection of elements maybe

393
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,079
cards you know uh but then some number

394
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,000
of those cards specifically the other

395
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,760
player or maybe there's a game master

396
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,120
player specifically just saying that

397
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,720
knows internally that you're not

398
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,839
supposed to be able to use those words

399
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,279
and there some 20 questions type of way

400
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,519
to be able to try to figure out what

401
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,560
those currents are without the language.

402
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,000
So that that that would be like a doctor

403
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,920
trying to figure out what they're

404
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,920
dealing with, you know, while that

405
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,000
>> you could make that game like guess who

406
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,000
where each person like draws a card and

407
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
you're allowed to like give a statement

408
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,200
to the other person or ask them

409
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,120
something and then you see whether like

410
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,120
escalate or deescalate and each

411
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,560
individual card has like traits where

412
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,440
you talk about this that's bad, you talk

413
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,639
about this that's good.

414
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,639
>> I I'm not familiar with guess. So, uh,

415
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,880
okay. So, it's not really that much like

416
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,880
Guess Who.

417
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,320
>> 20 questions. Is that

418
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,160
>> the idea thing of is everyone just you

419
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,560
have a whole bunch of character cards

420
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,560
and each of them have traits like watch

421
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,959
this? If you say this, they'll get

422
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,320
upset. If you say this, it's not very

423
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,000
fully fleshed out, but everyone just

424
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,839
like randomly draws traits and you take

425
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,839
turns like speaking to each other and

426
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,120
then the patients either get like will

427
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,079
respond and then either get like more

428
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,199
angry or sing.

429
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,959
>> So, It's almost like your like your role

430
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:34,720
is a collection of randomized traits or

431
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,639
randomized behavioral

432
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,199
uh rules.

433
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,639
>> Yeah.

434
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,800
>> Okay. So, rules

435
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:47,720
defined

436
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,720
by randomized rules.

437
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,680
All those people um in the assassin's

438
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,079
guild uh or familiar with the assassin's

439
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,920
guild, there's the concept of cycripts.

440
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:04,320
Uh things that you're that you as an

441
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,600
individual player uh are are are given

442
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,440
at the beginning of the game as things

443
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,360
that you can do or you have to do or if

444
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,720
you do something you have to do it under

445
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,240
specific conditions. The psych

446
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,519
psychological limitations is what

447
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,040
they're called. It could be something as

448
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,959
simple as you have to speak an accent

449
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,120
all the time or you have to live. It

450
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,639
could be something more like every time

451
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,480
you see blur, you have to run away

452
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,120
because there's a phobia and something

453
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,480
like that. Uh, and some it might be

454
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,880
interesting to think of collection of

455
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,519
those things and that crafts how we

456
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,600
behave. Um, so this makes me think I

457
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,399
should probably do the live action class

458
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,440
at some point and talk about party games

459
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,880
and and

460
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,240
uh I think you have

461
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,480
>> Oh, I hope my hands are up.

462
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,680
>> Okay, your hands are just up.

463
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,440
like

464
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,560
>> um another thing that a psychiatrist has

465
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,480
to do when they're talking to a patient

466
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,440
is to try to get the story out of them

467
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,199
like why why they're upset. So you could

468
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,399
have um a game where the patient has you

469
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,920
know some set of of cards that uh has

470
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,959
some some sort of story with some

471
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,639
keywords and the doctor has to try to

472
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,920
you know get the get these words out of

473
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,279
him but the patient himself can't the

474
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,880
patient himself doesn't fully know his

475
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,320
story. So like he keeps on changing. You

476
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,759
would keep modifying your story as you

477
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,600
go by drawing cards and throwing them

478
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,360
away and you can only really get the

479
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,519
full picture once you get all the cards

480
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,240
that the patient has in his hand. So

481
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,720
wait, so does the patient have all the

482
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,880
cards?

483
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,759
>> The p the patient has his full story,

484
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,880
but it keeps changing.

485
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:36,399
>> Okay. So Okay. So

486
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,320
ever changing story

487
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,040
>> and and you want to kind of stay on top

488
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,880
of entropy.

489
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,920
>> Yeah. Okay.

490
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,079
>> Cool.

491
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,800
Um, this isn't a fully fleshed out idea,

492
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,480
but as a mechanic, um, say there's a

493
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,240
doctor and a patient, and the do and the

494
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,399
only the only communication is through

495
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,639
cards. So, the doctor will like give the

496
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,199
patient two cards, and then the third

497
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,560
card is randomly, uh, inserted off of

498
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,240
like a deck and shuffled in, and the

499
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,240
patient receives all three.

500
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,680
>> So, it's like the patient might be

501
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,959
schizophrenic and imagining things and

502
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,160
they like get whatever the doctor's

503
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,679
saying, but they also get like other

504
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,799
random things as noise. So, so as a

505
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:17,039
mechanic that will be

506
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,199
um man I that's hard to describe two the

507
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,559
idea that you will be adding a

508
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,319
randomized

509
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,000
>> so you get information that is both what

510
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,439
the other person played and something

511
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,679
random and you can't distinguish which

512
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,360
is which

513
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,720
>> so you have a communication channel and

514
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,720
you're handing random noise.

515
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,720
>> Yeah.

516
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,320
[Laughter]

517
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,679
And what is not? Yeah,

518
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,039
I am running out of space. So, it's

519
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,039
okay.

520
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:55,000
>> Any other

521
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,000
That's creepy.

522
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,600
>> Anyone else?

523
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,880
One concept I thought was interesting

524
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,320
that I'm not really sure how you turn

525
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,840
into a game immediately is the idea of

526
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,320
the

527
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,240
patient and bically the doctor or the

528
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,720
rest of the world having to at the

529
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,840
moment irreconcilable irreconcilable

530
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,520
narratives

531
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:29,919
>> and the goal of bringing those into some

532
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,600
type of medium in which the patient can

533
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,080
you know comfortably exist with this

534
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,480
narrative that's in with the rest of the

535
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,840
world,

536
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,520
>> right?

537
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,240
>> So the the idea again of that narrative

538
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,960
disruption is kind of why people get

539
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,200
violent in the first place and so maybe

540
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,840
even taking out the question entirely of

541
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,679
what makes is this person going to act

542
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,760
violently, but can you even work

543
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,320
together with somebody to change how

544
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,200
they see the world until it makes sense

545
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,000
on both on both sides? Yeah.

546
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,000
>> Yeah. So that would something I can't

547
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,280
like actually that you would gain for

548
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,360
now be something like okay so you have

549
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,240
the patient's trying to tell this

550
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,799
patient and do doctor patient and doctor

551
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,640
and one person trying to portray a

552
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,000
message that one person the other person

553
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,080
trying to portray to the other but

554
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
there's like some something in the

555
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,160
middle that's changing everything

556
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,600
>> and so it's just trying to reconcile

557
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,679
that difference pretty much

558
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,880
>> figure out the connection like the

559
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,720
communication between each other

560
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,559
>> so so you kind of have a situation where

561
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,320
you actually have three people playing

562
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,440
And it's just some one person who's

563
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,280
changing information on

564
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,400
>> either predict unpredictable

565
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,000
unpredictable way

566
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,520
>> like maybe they they have their own

567
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,679
objective in mind.

568
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,160
>> So what they're trying the two people in

569
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,600
the end are trying to like figure out

570
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,360
what the other one's saying and then one

571
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,200
person in the middle is trying to has

572
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,000
their has their own agenda.

573
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,039
>> That's like representing schizophrenia.

574
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,160
So, so, so that there's a noisy

575
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:05,320
communications channel with an agenda. I

576
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,320
like that.

577
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,720
>> Yeah. I mean, that that could be a

578
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,080
algorithm that could be a person. Uh, it

579
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,520
could be a person running an algorithm

580
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,840
in their head. So, yeah.

581
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,080
>> Yeah. I mean, the noisy communication

582
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,160
channel could represent the actual state

583
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,080
of mind of the the patient. That is the

584
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,679
point, right? But I mean and then

585
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,200
depending upon again they're like the

586
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,840
level of arousal that could change like

587
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,200
how everything gets streamed into being

588
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,039
like very combative. And so like

589
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,600
everything the doctor says is sort of

590
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,600
taken as being

591
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,039
somehow

592
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,960
>> Yeah.

593
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,320
>> Yeah. some sort of some sort of variable

594
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,440
that's actually going to affect how

595
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,440
they're going to

596
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,440
>> Yeah.

597
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,120
>> Okay.

598
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Um, this meant well, this would probably

599
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,000
only work once the first time you play

600
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,720
through, but again, what you've

601
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,600
concealed from the players or certain

602
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,200
players themselves that

603
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,559
uh what their goals are or what they

604
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,320
believe to be true about the game state

605
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,679
is in fact a delusion or not true. So

606
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,480
you might you might tell them that it's

607
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,760
about this is a game set in 2100 when

608
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,760
you've been wrongly imprisoned in a

609
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,520
psychiatric ward and you must fight your

610
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,520
way out or something like that and

611
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,600
there's a you know voice will guide you

612
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,640
you know whatever and then and then but

613
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,320
you don't you don't tell you don't tell

614
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,919
that player that they're in fact playing

615
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,200
a player who believes you know these

616
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,559
things and you and then maybe you do

617
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,159
some sort of live action role playing or

618
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,360
not I'm not exactly sure but a game

619
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,799
which otherwise are forces with this

620
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,000
other guy who's convinced that this is

621
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,679
what the game is about. So it's like an

622
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,919
unreliable Yeah, I'm going to write an

623
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,960
unreliable scenario. Uh I know the

624
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,360
players don't know that going in, but uh

625
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,080
if folks have seen the film The Cabinet

626
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,840
of of Dr. Kagari, it's an old Germanic

627
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,400
specialist uh white film and I could

628
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,400
spoil it. Does anyone care? It's the old

629
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,400
1920s.

630
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,400
>> Unspoilers. I think you're fine. Uh but

631
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:08,640
but the basic idea comes down to the

632
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:11,520
hero of this sort of horror story is

633
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,320
actually just a patient in the in

634
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,440
psychiatric war and everybody who he

635
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,760
believes is part of this story that he's

636
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,000
uh conquering is somebody else in

637
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,760
psychiatric war. The big villain is

638
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,960
actually the person running.

639
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,159
>> Is that like Shutter?

640
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,880
>> Yeah. Yeah. It's like Shutter.

641
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,039
>> Yeah. Yeah. not not not not entirely

642
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,520
unlike a lot of different stories. But

643
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,120
similarity idea of the you know maybe

644
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,720
maybe the information we've been given

645
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,720
is not that they need to be trusting

646
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,080
something that go like that would be I

647
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,159
guess a game mechanic part of that would

648
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,120
be everyone's assigned a different role

649
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,559
and one of those roles is patient and so

650
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,159
you don't know if you're the patient or

651
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,080
not and so you're trying to do your

652
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,440
objectives and then as you play along

653
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,960
you realize you may or start to realize

654
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,960
things aren't actually as what they

655
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,799
seem. So eventually you may figure out

656
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,559
I'm actually the patient here.

657
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:04,000
>> Right. Right. Who's trying to train who?

658
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,799
And they're almost like fighting for

659
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,400
authority in that sense possibly. Okay.

660
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,679
>> Going along with that. Uh I think an

661
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,799
interesting mechanic would be like the

662
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,039
battle star black sylons method where

663
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,280
you the person knows that they're Sylon,

664
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,120
but they can infiltrate by doing that

665
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,919
voting system at the end. What is that?

666
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,440
It's the with the destiny part.

667
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,600
>> So you know that someone's trying to

668
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,919
sabotage you but you don't know who,

669
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,480
>> right? So gosh, how um

670
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,080
patient.

671
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,159
>> So that's kind of who's the patient from

672
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,360
a different way, right? It's like one is

673
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,360
you know player knows

674
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,400
>> who you know at least at least one

675
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,720
person knows

676
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:47,559
>> and then the other one is uh player

677
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,559
needs to figure out whether they are it.

678
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,200
>> This is just an interesting mechanic

679
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,320
thing. So there was this again RPG

680
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,559
called Brea the Oblivion that had this

681
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,120
really interesting mechanic for handling

682
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,559
the dark side that each player had which

683
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,240
might be kind of relevant in this

684
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,720
situation. Essentially, you had a

685
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,880
different person who was also playing

686
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,320
another protagonist also play your

687
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,960
antagonist.

688
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,480
>> And so they would either talk to you and

689
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,480
tell you things or they would just

690
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,000
directly control your character like if

691
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,720
you kind of fail the compos the

692
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,120
composure role. And taking the

693
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,600
adversarial side of your character away

694
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,440
from your control kind of um it it means

695
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,279
that you your character is more likely

696
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,360
to behave in a really disruptive way

697
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,200
rather than just a controllably

698
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,720
disruptive way how it would be if you

699
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,279
were had a best interest in your

700
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,480
character.

701
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,880
>> So open takes control of your character.

702
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,039
>> Yeah. Uh and and that might work really

703
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,000
well with some of the ideas of I did a

704
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,000
good cop bad cop ide.

705
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,600
Okay.

706
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,760
>> So, um actually going off of the uh the

707
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,320
like the audio idea of like someone is

708
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,960
is actually hearing voices and this

709
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,480
whole um who was the patient thing, you

710
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,360
could actually have things where you

711
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,720
have uh one player is actually playing a

712
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,400
patient who is schizophrenic

713
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,600
>> and another player is playing the voices

714
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,520
in his head.

715
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,760
So you you but like they don't really

716
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,080
know that like they they're playing this

717
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,400
scenario where you know they they have

718
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,520
some delusion that they're crafted or

719
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,039
whatever. Um

720
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,200
>> Oh.

721
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,480
>> So like like having having like just

722
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,840
have a person actually being the like

723
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,200
like as you were saying like have an

724
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,320
actual person be the dark side of of the

725
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,919
patient.

726
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,039
>> Um

727
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,039
so but neither of them know who's the

728
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,400
dark side. Well, I mean the the patient

729
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah. I mean you could have

730
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,640
>> one way you could arbitrate this is you

731
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,640
could say that the the patient player is

732
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,760
able to just basically do as they please

733
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,000
but

734
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,840
>> with there are rules which govern

735
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,320
whether the dark side character can take

736
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,640
over.

737
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,640
>> Yeah.

738
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,240
>> Yeah. Yeah. Something like that. Or

739
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,159
>> so and that means that means that the

740
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,159
patient is kind of genuinely driven to

741
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,039
try and reach a compromise but they can

742
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,760
just be overruled by dark side. Yeah.

743
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,200
>> So,

744
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,200
>> and there could also be things where

745
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,559
like it's it could be like more of a

746
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,919
strong role playinging thing where the

747
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,679
voice is actually just trying to

748
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,799
convince him that yes, this delusion is

749
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,720
real.

750
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,880
>> So, but you still think you have a

751
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,320
recorded thing or actually two different

752
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,600
>> You could actually have two people just

753
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,919
actually standing there talking to each

754
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,799
other.

755
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,919
>> Okay. So, two uh people playing one

756
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,640
character.

757
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,720
>> Yeah.

758
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,480
>> It it would potentially require a lot of

759
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,400
suspension of disbelief on the part of

760
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,600
the uh person playing the psychiatrist.

761
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:49,120
It might be one of those things that's

762
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:50,720
easier to um mediate by having people

763
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,679
uh talk through a screen or something

764
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,279
like that, you know, uh or even a

765
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,480
microphone and a speaker kind of thing.

766
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,279
Could be a game where you can play on a

767
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,360
phone.

768
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,720
>> Uh that would be

769
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,000
>> I've not seen many games that are

770
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,919
designed specifically to be played on

771
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,440
phones, but function.

772
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,880
I definitely like that idea and I think

773
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,400
it could work well with a card game as

774
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,159
well if you have two players sharing the

775
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,080
same hand and the player who actually

776
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,880
gets to play the cards from the hand is

777
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,159
whoever is in control of the patient and

778
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,760
so as things uh diff as the state

779
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,840
basically changes depending on what the

780
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,159
doctor does uh different players become

781
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,159
in control of the patient's hand.

782
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,799
>> So so it seems like we actually have a

783
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,200
lot of different options on how we could

784
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:36,080
mechanic uh somebody who's mentally

785
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,799
unstable. uh and um and a bunch of also

786
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,720
a bunch of ideas of how how that state

787
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,080
switch could happen uh or what rules

788
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,320
make up. Uh so that's pretty cool and

789
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,000
that that's not

790
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,080
uh and that's not mutually exclusive

791
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,400
from any other ideas specifically about

792
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,240
a patient and a doctor, right? So all

793
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,240
we're talking about what happens to the

794
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,760
patient. Uh these are the rules that a

795
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,200
patient could be operating under. The

796
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,159
doctor could have a different set of

797
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,320
rules, all rules.

798
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,880
>> I was reading about this and I think

799
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,240
that it turns out most violence in

800
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,640
psychiatric wards happens uh to the

801
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,559
patients themselves or to other patients

802
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,320
by patients much more than it actually

803
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:20,000
happens to towards practitioners.

804
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,760
>> And I'm just noticing that I don't think

805
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,480
any of our ideas addressed any of those

806
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,440
issues. board management maybe gets a

807
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,960
little closer.

808
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,760
>> Yeah, people start turning on

809
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,960
themselves.

810
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,799
>> So, I was I was just thinking so another

811
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,240
possible way that you could apply all

812
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,440
this a lot of these role playing

813
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,279
multiple role or auditory mechanics is

814
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,600
to a situation. we should we we should

815
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,600
probably do research in what situations

816
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,720
lead to patients coming in contact with

817
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,559
each other and then the encounter

818
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,080
turning violent. And then perhaps just

819
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,440
having

820
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,880
all players be patients that have

821
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,120
various different mental disorders. And

822
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,760
then and just to help you understand in

823
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,520
the as a patient what what kinds of

824
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,520
behaviors and situations would lead you

825
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,799
to uh going violent on someone else.

826
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,919
>> Just sort of one of those like be in

827
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,120
someone else's shoes helps you

828
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,559
understand the situation better,

829
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,559
>> right? So just putting them in uh in a

830
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,039
situ uh putting them in an environment

831
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,840
where everything that is necessary for

832
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,559
your charact for a certain character to

833
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,960
become upset environment and then just

834
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,480
seeing how that naturally occurs without

835
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,080
necessarily saying and now you

836
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,000
>> okay

837
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,799
a game of persuasion that's a cross

838
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,080
between like BS and Uno. So, you have

839
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,320
two doctors who are trying to get rid of

840
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,799
cards in their hand. Um, and then the

841
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,120
patient wants a certain set of cards and

842
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,960
he's saying, "I'm looking for John." And

843
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,440
the two doctors pull out a card, they

844
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,440
say, "Oh, this is John." Or they can be

845
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,799
like, "This isn't John, but I can help

846
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,600
you out later."

847
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,840
>> Oh, so this is a this is that almost

848
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,200
seems like an educate um intended to

849
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:02,720
teach people not to.

850
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,679
>> So, um so I'm going to say

851
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,279
fish.

852
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:08,279
>> Yeah. Honest honesty.

853
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,360
So, we got a pretty good pile here. Um,

854
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,559
a lot of these

855
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,880
uh can obviously be combined and there's

856
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,760
no reason why multiple groups couldn't

857
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,600
attempt to do similar topics. Uh, in

858
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,880
fact, you could take exactly the same

859
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,240
set and I'm pretty sure two different

860
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,360
groups are going to come in the same

861
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,840
way. So, that's fine. Uh, again, a lot

862
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,760
of live of things that could probably be

863
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,279
easier done live action or at least

864
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,679
easier to prototype live action. the um

865
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:53,279
the the the folks who were here on

866
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,720
Monday um they are actually

867
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:59,039
uh focused mostly on trying to see what

868
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,559
could be moved out to more people uh

869
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:04,799
more resident trainee uh in uh in the

870
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,360
future. Your games don't necessarily

871
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,200
need to do that but uh but you might

872
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,600
want want to keep that this this

873
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,360
assignment is game for a client after

874
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,080
all. And you know, if you manage to

875
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,240
address that need of the, you know,

876
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,919
here's something that doesn't require

877
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,799
one person from the original GMT

878
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,480
to do it. And you can imagine like you

879
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,399
know the acting exercise that that that

880
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,120
that they ran through you know Dion's

881
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:35,360
particularly talented uh at improvising

882
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:38,559
to speak but you know requires

883
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:42,240
requires uh you know people requires

884
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,840
resources that not necessarily um every

885
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,399
every training environment is going to

886
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,640
have something that can be turned into a

887
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:51,440
fairly understandable set set of rules

888
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,200
or use or using technologies that are

889
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,240
fairly accessible. um you know, if

890
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,600
you're going to play your voice in

891
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,080
someone's ear, it's going to be a lot

892
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,480
easier if that was using uh something

893
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,880
recorded or something like a phone as

894
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,960
opposed to

895
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,240
that if it was if it was a phone

896
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,760
conversation actually going like so it's

897
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,799
live and people are in different rooms

898
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,320
and actually talking to each other over

899
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,039
the phone over Skype or something like

900
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,120
that. But but you're talking to someone,

901
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:18,720
you have a phone up so then the other

902
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,559
person can hear what you're saying and

903
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,600
be the evil voice

904
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,039
>> like you know.

905
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,320
>> Yeah. such a thing that you don't even

906
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,320
need to do on Skype, right? You just get

907
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,320
two cell phones to hit with with

908
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,279
handsree sets and and now the technology

909
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,440
just becomes that much easier for for

910
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,279
users to

911
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,000
two phones and two two headsets. It's

912
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,760
almost

913
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,360
>> I mean or you could make it that like

914
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,039
for some game that two people are

915
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,039
playing that like two groups are playing

916
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,559
the same game but they both hear the

917
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,039
other group like this group would hear

918
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,159
the other groups playing the game. So,

919
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,200
it's not even just like a random

920
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,480
conversation. It's like they're playing

921
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,440
the same game you're playing, but you're

922
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,120
hearing the other group playing the

923
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,720
game. So, you get to

924
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,000
>> Wow.

925
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,279
>> Wow.

926
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,440
>> Uh deep.

927
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:09,880
>> I would say two groups

928
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,880
uh you drop in the same game.

929
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,679
So, I just wanted to say

930
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,200
that I think the thing which is really

931
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,960
hard if you don't if you're working with

932
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,640
people who like don't really want to do

933
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,720
a role playing thing

934
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,240
>> is like building a level of emotional

935
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,120
intensity and the fear of violence.

936
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,480
Um, which is kind of the point of the

937
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,720
training like you want to be able to

938
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,600
deal with that kind of emotional stress

939
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,799
on your feet.

940
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,640
>> Yeah. Um, so I was just wondering

941
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,480
because I don't have any good ideas if

942
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,600
anyone could think of something which

943
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,039
which works out

944
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,399
>> which can like genuinely create a

945
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,200
situation where a monkey would be afraid

946
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,159
of violence.

947
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,640
>> Yeah.

948
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,600
>> Without actually without somebody having

949
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,039
to threaten another person.

950
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,320
I don't think he's going to be able to

951
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,720
color on

952
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:02,640
>> well well if one player's role is

953
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,480
actually

954
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,399
not to understand but to provide the

955
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,399
experience for the other

956
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,480
>> and they're hearing a recording that is

957
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,560
giving them cues as to what to do and

958
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,760
one of their cues is eventually like and

959
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,960
no player is not brief this and one of

960
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,240
their cues is like and now you know

961
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,440
grabbing the player by the shoulders and

962
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,079
like shake them violently and say you

963
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,839
know say something you could you could

964
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,159
possibly create a situ situation where

965
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,280
you're like, whoa, you know, buddy,

966
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,040
>> but the problem is you have to be able

967
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,800
to get somebody who can do that without

968
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,440
like cracking up in the middle of it

969
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,599
because like people do that when they're

970
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,359
nervous and uncomfortable. Like you so

971
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,159
you pretty much be reduced to finding

972
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,839
professional actors and that's a limited

973
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,599
resource that like limit puts a

974
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,839
limitation on on how widespread your

975
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,240
game

976
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,560
>> even people will take things seriously

977
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,119
resource you have.

978
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,720
>> I have a thought where you have like

979
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,320
it's a patient patient interaction. So

980
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,359
you have two people in different rooms

981
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,079
on the phone with each other trying to

982
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:01,680
negotiate something. I don't know what

983
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,079
what it would be and have two other

984
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,760
people in each of in each of their rooms

985
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,040
that are like talking in their ear and

986
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
trying to distract them from the

987
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,320
conversation.

988
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:16,000
>> Okay. So so patient talking to patient

989
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,800
uh maybe can like

990
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,240
medicine

991
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,240
uh with uh voices in person. Yeah.

992
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,240
>> Yeah.

993
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:38,119
>> Uh there is a specifically an article on

994
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,119
that I think. So actually

995
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,880
Patrick.

996
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,280
>> Um so I was thinking something along the

997
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,040
lines of of like battleship if you have

998
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,119
um like a doctor player and patient

999
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,920
player and they're both looking at this

1000
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,160
um their own version of the same board

1001
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,359
>> and if the uh the patient wants to get

1002
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,119
from one end to the other um and the

1003
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,119
doctor has to allow whether or not they

1004
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,960
can make their move but on the doctor's

1005
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,640
board they have like different obstacles

1006
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,839
and so then um like the patient will say

1007
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,440
I want to move from here to here and the

1008
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,760
doctor says I can't let you do that I

1009
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,839
can let you go from here to here um it'd

1010
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,480
be a game about a compromise

1011
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:22,480
>> okay so sort of uh okay um doctor

1012
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,880
mediated movement okay

1013
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,880
forward movement

1014
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,920
>> and and the battleship analogy is good

1015
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,920
to help us remember.

1016
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,640
>> Yeah. Uh to address something that Owen

1017
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,359
said about the trying to simulate u

1018
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,839
fear. Uh I mean if you can add time

1019
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,640
pressure to any game then I think that

1020
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:49,280
that strong of a stress situation it

1021
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,240
could kind of almost be fear. It could

1022
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,599
be a spider

1023
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,240
>> because what what you're really going

1024
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,200
for is stress

1025
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,520
you're going to make decision

1026
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,520
>> falling creating.

1027
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,280
>> Yeah.

1028
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,160
>> Anyways,

1029
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,400
>> uh

1030
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,640
>> um so kind of like an idea of how to

1031
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,400
take the the doctor mediated board and

1032
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,079
move it into the real world is that you

1033
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,839
could have we're talking about these

1034
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,880
like phoneto phone conversations. You

1035
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:19,280
could have the patient is like um in a

1036
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,800
room but he's blindfolded

1037
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,480
>> and like he's trying to like move

1038
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,320
through the room like towards an exit in

1039
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,920
the room or something and the doctor has

1040
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,480
like some limited information about the

1041
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,920
room and has to like help him like

1042
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,720
navigate through the room and he'll say

1043
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,119
like I want to move you know forward and

1044
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,800
he's like well you yeah you I can't

1045
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,040
really let you do that because there's a

1046
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,160
pit of spikes in front of you. So you

1047
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,280
wouldn't necessarily actually have a

1048
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,720
real pitull of spikes in front of them,

1049
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,480
but like that that kind of thing where

1050
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,040
you're trying to like gather information

1051
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,720
and and help them through this and it

1052
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,640
you can like even put time pressure on

1053
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,960
it and say like, well, you know, I have

1054
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,320
to make a decision now because he wants

1055
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,079
to move now,

1056
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,079
>> but I might like accidentally move him

1057
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,160
into an obstacle and like how to deal

1058
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,079
with that. that or you could have a

1059
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,280
thing where no or you can combine it

1060
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,079
with some things that there are things

1061
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:10,400
that the that the patient needs to do

1062
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,640
that the patient can talk about.

1063
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,560
>> Uh and you know it might be something

1064
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,480
like the patient has to move every 10

1065
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,520
seconds and only the patient knows this.

1066
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,839
The doctor doesn't

1067
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,480
>> the patient has a fear of moving to the

1068
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,720
left

1069
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,079
>> or something like that. Things like that

1070
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,560
patient has moved left. And I think it

1071
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,920
it also emphasizes the thing that um

1072
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,359
they were talking about on Monday in

1073
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,240
that you are both trying to to not like

1074
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,839
if if a it gets to the escalates to the

1075
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,760
point where violence happens,

1076
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,280
>> you're both trying to not let yourself

1077
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,280
get hurt, but you're also trying to not

1078
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,800
hurt them as well.

1079
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,920
>> And I think incorporating that some way

1080
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,320
would be cool.

1081
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,440
>> Definitely a lot of these ideas and sort

1082
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,720
of like mechanicking the patients

1083
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,560
limitations are really really cool. uh

1084
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,040
but again remember the audience is the

1085
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,880
resident. So understanding what what

1086
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,440
what what patient going through is

1087
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,839
useful but also understanding thinking

1088
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,560
of rules that help uh resident

1089
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,160
understand what they can do uh is also

1090
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,760
really important. So don't don't don't

1091
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,440
just think about throwing tons of

1092
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,760
limitations on them without also giving

1093
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,839
them abilities uh you know things that

1094
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,800
they can actively do that you can

1095
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,800
actually carry out. So ripping off the

1096
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,040
time pressure thing, I think that it

1097
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,320
might make sense for these kinds of

1098
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,640
escalation negotiation type situations

1099
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:31,839
for the um for the person who is

1100
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,760
controlling the patient to kind of know

1101
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:36,240
what their triggers are and every time

1102
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,480
like a bad thing is said then the they

1103
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,720
just reduce the amount of time that the

1104
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,640
doctor has to deal with them

1105
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,720
>> and like and they say that okay they

1106
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,680
just say like minus 10 seconds and like

1107
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,680
and the they have a timer and ticks down

1108
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,880
to reach the conclusion, getting the the

1109
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,920
doctor, getting them to where they want

1110
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,800
to be.

1111
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,680
>> Um, and and so rather than like raising

1112
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,160
their voice or being physically in some

1113
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,000
way, they just like adjust a timer and

1114
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:06,800
when it gets down to zero. So,

1115
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,119
>> yeah, I can see that I wrote equals

1116
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,440
reduce time variable

1117
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,400
actually equals.

1118
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,800
>> Okay. Um,

1119
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,400
just to say that way you can make your

1120
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,000
players feel pressure is to give them a

1121
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,000
really flat goal hierarchy, right? So, a

1122
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,240
good example is missile command. Does

1123
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,520
everyone know that game? So, missile

1124
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,800
command is you have like six cities and

1125
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,200
there's missiles coming and you have to

1126
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,839
shoot them all down and each city is

1127
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,200
equally valuable. So, if you lose one,

1128
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,760
you're in drastically reduced position.

1129
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,599
Um whereas games that tend to have like

1130
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,920
a more structured goal hierarchy will

1131
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,920
have like basically means you can afford

1132
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,599
a loss, right? So like chess is a good

1133
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,440
example. You say, "Okay, I can afford to

1134
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,560
lose this." Whereas a missile command,

1135
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,800
you can't afford to lose anything. So by

1136
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,560
really capping,

1137
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,079
you know, what the player has and what

1138
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,079
they're what they can afford to lose.

1139
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:02,240
And then making sure that, you know, all

1140
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,000
of their goals are equal value, that

1141
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:07,359
means that every loss and every failure

1142
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,040
is felt much more strongly. And I I felt

1143
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,240
like at least Dion when you were doing

1144
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,800
your the role play um there was this

1145
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,119
sense especially coming from Caesar that

1146
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,280
you know any one thing that goes wrong

1147
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,880
is really bad. There's like a really

1148
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,560
thin line there.

1149
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,560
>> I mean that's especially applicable when

1150
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,160
you're talking about the doctor's goals,

1151
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,440
not necessarily the patient's goals.

1152
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,119
>> Yeah. Yeah. From I mean from the

1153
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,599
doctor's position, right? There's you

1154
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,839
can't really afford a lot of mistakes in

1155
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,839
these situations.

1156
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,119
Um, I'm kind of the guest, but I was

1157
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,119
listening to what you're saying and um,

1158
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,119
I've had a thought on how you could

1159
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,760
combine lots of these different ideas.

1160
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,079
Um, I'm envisioning a game where there

1161
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,599
would be two types of players like you

1162
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,640
were mentioning, um, doctors and

1163
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,480
patients. And there would be one doctor

1164
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,800
and multiple patients. It would be a

1165
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,480
turn-based game where you'd go around,

1166
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,319
give each person a turn. and the doctor

1167
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,400
would always be in a relationship with

1168
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:10,640
each individual one and um limited

1169
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,640
vocabulary I thought was important. Um

1170
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,319
taking that from a couple of the ideas,

1171
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,240
the patient and the doctor each have

1172
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:19,520
their own set of vocabularies and the

1173
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:23,680
clash of that would introduce some um a

1174
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,599
mechanic there where the patient has um

1175
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,119
their own vocabulary describing to the

1176
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,960
doctor what they like, what they don't

1177
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,520
like. Um they know what they like, they

1178
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:36,640
don't like. you you could abstract it to

1179
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:38,400
um describe uh maybe

1180
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,720
anything that the doctor would have in

1181
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,200
their vocabulary. So, uh as one example,

1182
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,000
the doctor could give the patient a card

1183
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,160
with a shape or um some item on it and

1184
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,160
the item has attributes like color,

1185
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:53,440
shape, something that um somebody could

1186
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,640
like or dislike in their list. um they

1187
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,720
would look at this and see um one of

1188
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,200
these things clashes with something in

1189
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,240
my list of dislikes. I don't like that

1190
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,079
card. I'm going to escalate my um my

1191
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,119
anger, my uh displeasure with the

1192
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,040
situation. And so the doctor has a

1193
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,560
limited amount of time to deal with each

1194
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,160
patient. Um as the patient's escalation

1195
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,839
increases,

1196
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,400
they have less and less time to be dealt

1197
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:22,079
with. After a certain point, the doctor

1198
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,280
loses that patient. So you have that

1199
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,000
loss brought in. Um and then after all

1200
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,079
the patients have been lost, the the

1201
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,560
game is over. The way that it would be

1202
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,119
won is that the doctor is discovering

1203
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,839
the profile of each patient because they

1204
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,560
are trying to um like in a normal

1205
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,839
setting in a in a real life setting,

1206
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,280
you're trying to discover the the

1207
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:46,720
profile that allows the doctor to um

1208
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,800
deal with the patient in the best

1209
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:54,880
possible way so that they aren't

1210
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:58,160
violent. Um and yeah, so so so that that

1211
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,000
seems to play off the um the patient and

1212
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,760
doctor have different ro rules and goals

1213
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,720
and triggers. You know, you've got a

1214
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,079
situation where in in uh in what he was

1215
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,880
suggesting, you have one doctor to

1216
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,319
multiple patients. Um which is which is

1217
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,119
accurate. I'm not quite sure that that

1218
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,480
they'd be dealing with them

1219
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,760
simultaneously, but that might not

1220
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:19,040
matter for the purposes of strategy. Uh

1221
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,280
and uh and

1222
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:23,680
and yeah, it might be it might be kind

1223
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,760
of like those like those improv things

1224
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,520
where if you manage to figure out uh if

1225
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,839
you manage to figure out before time

1226
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,319
runs out what a person's profile is,

1227
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:37,359
that could be the win condition. So it's

1228
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,920
equal win uh if you manage to succeed is

1229
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,680
an equal loss if you don't manage to get

1230
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,720
it by time. combine it with something

1231
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,680
like the uh give a trigger and reduce

1232
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,119
the amount of time that you have

1233
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,960
available. Number of turns available for

1234
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:54,640
doesn't have to be real time. Um so yeah

1235
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:58,119
so so that so you can present with

1236
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,119
multiple patients.

1237
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,040
>> So like that doesn't even necessarily

1238
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,400
have to deal with uh actual talking

1239
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,000
about actual psychiatric warrant

1240
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,839
situations. That could be something

1241
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,119
like, you know, objects and colors,

1242
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:16,079
right? You know, it's more of a guessing

1243
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,240
game, but uh that might be too abstract

1244
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,520
possibly because because in the end, you

1245
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,119
kind of still want people to be able to

1246
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,400
tie it back to the experience of uh like

1247
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,480
to be able to make make an easy

1248
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,079
connection with uh what it's like to be

1249
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,960
a resident or what's going to be like to

1250
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:36,319
be a resident. Um so, uh this is where

1251
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,880
the theme needs to be pretty clear. Um

1252
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,720
but then like Clara, you know, is not

1253
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:45,040
meeting. The meeting has also done tied

1254
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:46,960
pretty well with young mechanics. Um so

1255
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,880
uh that's just something to keep in

1256
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,880
mind.

1257
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,880
Um

1258
00:45:53,280 --> 00:46:00,880
okay. Um so we've got about another half

1259
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,560
an hour plus. Uh

1260
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,319
I think the plan was just to let

1261
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,560
everyone kind of like figure out what

1262
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,720
teams you wanted to be in. you know,

1263
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:12,960
this is kind of pre-class time to talk

1264
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:15,760
uh to talk with each other and um see if

1265
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,000
there's stuff in here that people were

1266
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,520
really psyched about. Is there is there

1267
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,800
anyone in this class that's already

1268
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,160
like, you know, this is something I

1269
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,760
really want to do? Um

1270
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,720
>> well, my preference is towards the

1271
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:32,400
management.

1272
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:36,760
>> Okay. So, what award management.

1273
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,760
So yeah, just one.

1274
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,119
>> Yeah, I don't really have any plans for

1275
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,240
this.

1276
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:46,960
>> I'd be interested in in uh in voices and

1277
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,200
hidden information. So

1278
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,680
fooling players in in and that results

1279
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:53,119
in them behaving in erratic ways as from

1280
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,079
the point of view of other players and

1281
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,359
then from the point of view the player

1282
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,319
who's behaving radically other players

1283
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,680
behaving erratically because it's not

1284
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,359
fitting with what they think is actually

1285
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,280
going on

1286
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,920
>> or voices or both or something like

1287
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,280
that.

1288
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,359
>> So that's that's kind of the general

1289
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,680
territory that you're interested in

1290
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,440
anyone who wants to

1291
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:14,079
>> I'm very interested in the escalation

1292
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,079
deescalation by hidden keywords.

1293
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,960
I like uh I like basically hidden rules,

1294
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,839
goals, and keywords and two different

1295
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:27,880
players uh playing the same character.

1296
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,880
Two mechanics I really like.

1297
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,520
Okay, we we have a couple of seeds out

1298
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:39,119
there and uh you know the caffeine helps

1299
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:42,400
us a bunch in the

1300
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:43,760
um what do we have on Friday?

1301
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,280
>> Um Friday we mostly just have

1302
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,280
brainstorming and team building

1303
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,400
schedule. I mean I think that time is

1304
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,760
pretty flexible.

1305
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:55,359
>> So what I can do maybe if folks can plan

1306
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,119
to come into Wednesday with the team

1307
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,760
then what I might do is I might move my

1308
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,240
my

1309
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,839
>> Friday. Friday.

1310
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:06,560
Yeah. Then um then I will I'll move my

1311
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:09,200
live action talk up till Friday instead.

1312
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,359
>> So So Wednesday we can just follow. It

1313
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,160
seems like a lot of people are going in

1314
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:16,319
that direction.

1315
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:18,000
Yeah. Okay. You don't have to do a live

1316
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:21,280
action game, but it's one of my favorite

1317
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,280
games. So
