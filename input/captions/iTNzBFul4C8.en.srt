00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,280
ANDREW BENNETT: SeaPerch
is really a system

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,910
or an approach to learning.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,570
It's in the form of a
small little vehicle that

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,550
drives around underwater, but
it's a lot more than that.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,380
We are trying to disseminate
love of the ocean

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,740
and teaching about the
ocean as broadly as we can.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,240
And SeaPerch is
meant just for that.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,770

11
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,200
DIANE BRANCAZIO: SeaPerch
is a fabulous project

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,290
for middle and high school
students developed at the MIT

13
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,350
Sea Grant college program.

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,480
TEAGAN SULLIVAN: The SeaPerch
was made in about 2000.

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,167
It's not outdated per se,
but there's definitely

16
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:50,000
a lot of stuff that's
come around since then

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,300
that could be added to it.

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,870
ANDREW BENNETT: We specifically
wanted MIT students

19
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,690
to help us create the SeaPerch
II and the SeaPerch II concept,

20
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,630
because they're bringing a fresh
set of eyes to the problem.

21
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,690
TEAGAN SULLIVAN: I
love seeing people

22
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,290
get excited about engineering
and get excited about learning.

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,000
MAN: Oh, wow.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,220
DIANE BRANCAZIO: Now it's
a robot that's not just

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,360
going underwater and
just driving around,

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,220
but now it can sense things.

27
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,600
Now it can grip things.

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,550
Now it can do many more things
that the original SeaPerch could

29
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,157
not do.

30
00:01:22,157 --> 00:01:24,240
ANDREW BENNETT: There is
an international SeaPerch

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,550
competition every spring,
and last year there

32
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,847
were 144 teams from
all over the world.

33
00:01:28,847 --> 00:01:30,430
DIANE BRANCAZIO:
Kids will have teams.

34
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,263
They'll build something
and they'll practice

35
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:34,050
and practice and refine.

36
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,390
They make the robot
frame out of PVC pipe.

37
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,080
They get motors, make a cable
that goes to a control box,

38
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,980
so now they've made a robot
that they built. And they

39
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,510
can change the
design of the frame

40
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,370
and they can change
its performance.

41
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,940
TEAGAN SULLIVAN:
From the get-go,

42
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,390
SeaPerch is about
exploring design.

43
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,890
You have to think
about buoyancy.

44
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,473
You have to think
about how am I going

45
00:01:55,473 --> 00:01:57,082
to make everything stay dry?

46
00:01:57,082 --> 00:01:59,290
You have to think about the
placement of your motors,

47
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,580
because when you're
driving underwater,

48
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,050
you can move in any direction.

49
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,475
So if you want to
drive straight,

50
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:05,100
you have to really
think about how am I

51
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,870
going to make this robot level?

52
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,580
DIANE BRANCAZIO:
The SeaPerch project

53
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,280
is really outreach for the
Sea Grant college program.

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,850
It's really great to have MIT
students working on the project,

55
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,010
because they're able to bring
their passion for engineering

56
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,860
and put it into a
project that is going

57
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,140
to be used in the high
schools and middle schools

58
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,362
that they went to.

59
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:30,320
TEAGAN SULLIVAN: Developing
an educational tool

60
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,030
for other people feels
really rewarding.

61
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,070
I love trying to make the world
a better place by educating

62
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,960
others and helping people learn
through learning yourself.
