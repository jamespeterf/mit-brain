1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,400
so how is a quantum computer different

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,359
we can begin to answer that question by

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,960
comparing it with a classical computer

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,000
classical computers are the Computing

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,960
devices that of course we use every day

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,160
at work and at home and they process

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,279
information using transistors Each of

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,480
which can store one bit of information

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,840
we'll call this a classical bit a

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,720
classical bit is binary it can either be

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,240
in state zero or it can be in state one

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,039
we can contrast that with a quantum

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,119
computer which is built from logical

14
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,599
elements called cubits which is short

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,960
for Quantum bids a cubit can be set in

16
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:37,160
state zero or state one but a cubit can

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,079
also be in a Quantum superposition State

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,800
it's a single state but it carries

19
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:44,039
aspects of both state zero and state one

20
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,039
simultaneously as a result quantum

21
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,879
computers rely on encoding information

22
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,960
in fundamentally different ways than

23
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,559
classical computers for more MIT moments
