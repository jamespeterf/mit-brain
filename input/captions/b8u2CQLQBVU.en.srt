1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,720
So today's class uh is uh introductory

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,400
class. We'll talk uh about the class

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:25,119
itself uh and uh about the program of

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:28,000
the class. uh uh then uh uh Jake will

5
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:33,200
talk a little bit about the uh uh

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,079
financial uh financial terms uh and uh

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,399
uh and ideas and I'll talk uh about bond

8
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:43,440
mass a little bit. So the the class is

9
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,520
because it is

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,239
uh organized

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:54,000
to introduce you uh to uh to the uh

12
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,800
applications of of mass in real world.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,199
Uh the class is split between a

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,640
mathematical part which will be taught

15
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,960
by by Peter and uh application part uh

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,159
which will be taught by many people uh

17
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,400
who come from industry.

18
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,920
uh maybe start with a little bit of

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:19,360
introduction of myself uh and how it is

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:23,520
all comes together. So uh I I was at MIT

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,720
a long time ago. I got my PhD uh from

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,960
mass department in uh 92. Uh my adviser

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:34,240
was Gil Strang.

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,400
uh and uh my uh topic of my uh PhD was

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,920
has nothing had nothing to do with with

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
finance.

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,240
It was actually applications where it

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,600
was about wavelets uh and applications

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,520
were in signal processing. So after that

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,960
I was a mass professor for for a few

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,439
years uh and did mass research. Uh but

32
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:00,240
at some point I decided to to switch to

33
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,399
uh to the industry and um somehow I did

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,000
uh like mathematical finance. So since

35
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,759
then I've been at quant working in uh in

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,480
mathematical finance. I've worked in in

37
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,280
many many places for a long time. I was

38
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,440
with Morgan Stanley and right now I I

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:23,120
run uh fixed income quants at RBC.

40
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,920
Uh so uh

41
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:31,599
the uh

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:34,959
and and uh my history is definitely

43
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,879
I I very much uh appreciate having

44
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,760
experience both with academia and and

45
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,200
and with industry and that's what uh

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,000
what I would like to uh to show and uh

47
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,840
to show you through through the class.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,200
So now a little bit more about the

49
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,080
class.

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,160
Uh so as I said there will be math part

51
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,360
and uh there will be finance part. The

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,720
the uh lectures will be intertwined not

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,840
necessarily one after another but uh but

54
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,319
more or less uh

55
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,040
in equal proportion.

56
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,519
uh the um

57
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,560
in terms of prerequisites uh I do think

58
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,879
that you all have uh necessary

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,480
mathematical prerequisites which is uh

60
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:24,080
linear algebra some statistics uh and

61
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,400
some uh probably some uh calculus and

62
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,440
mathematical analysis uh we don't

63
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,200
require any prior knowledge uh of

64
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:38,000
finance uh even though uh if you have

65
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,319
been doing uh some uh some work or

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
internships before that that certainly

67
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,879
helps.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,680
Here is uh the schedule uh which we

69
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,760
intend to to keep and please keep in

70
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,760
mind that things may change and may

71
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:57,439
shift uh uh particularly with uh with

72
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,640
invited speakers. Uh Peter will talk uh

73
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:04,159
about the mathematical uh part uh here

74
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,360
but I I'll just introduce uh the uh a

75
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,560
few classes. So in a week's time uh Jeff

76
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,680
Shen from uh from Black Rockck will talk

77
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,040
about uh equity investing in particular

78
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,799
quantitative equity investing. Uh then

79
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,960
uh Stefan Andre from Two Sigma will talk

80
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,120
about principal component analysis uh

81
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,880
and finance which should go well

82
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:32,639
together with uh with what Peter will be

83
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,520
talking about at the time. Uh then uh

84
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:40,160
Andrew Constensson from Mizuho

85
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,479
uh will will talk uh about uh linear

86
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:47,120
rates products, swaps, bonds and curve

87
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:49,440
construction. Um then James Shepard from

88
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,320
Quantel Technologies which is now part

89
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,680
of uh London Stock Exchange will talk

90
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,120
about optimization uh and compress

91
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:03,199
compressing derivative portfolios.

92
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:08,400
Uh then uh very interesting uh lecture

93
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:12,720
uh by Takman Mansour uh and and uh uh

94
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,080
Luna Lopez from Kchi. Uh they'll talk

95
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,680
about their company and how they

96
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:21,199
started. They all they both are MIT

97
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:25,919
alums uh and actually uh alums from the

98
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:28,479
class from a few years ago. Uh then um

99
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,680
uh Ross Garham from Millennium uh will

100
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,880
talk uh

101
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,199
about investments uh in systematic

102
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:43,039
investments. Uh Andrew Law from MIT will

103
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,039
talk actually about applying uh some

104
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,479
techniques from computational finance

105
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:53,840
into uh biio medicine and biomedical

106
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:57,600
portfolio. and uh oh I I missed uh both

107
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,919
Jake and myself uh there but Jake will

108
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,880
talk about about portfolio optimization

109
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,199
I'll and I'll talk about uh black shaws

110
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:10,240
and and the last invited lecture will be

111
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,319
by John Hull uh who is u legendary in

112
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,680
derivative space but he will actually

113
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:19,680
talk uh uh about machine uh machine

114
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,800
learning his newest interest

115
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,919
With that, let me pass it on to Peter.

116
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,720
>> Okay. Thank you, M.

117
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,520
Let's see. Let me just page back up to

118
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,680
the schedule of lectures. Um, although

119
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,240
before that, let me give a brief

120
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,479
self-introduction. I have a PhD degree

121
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,880
in statistics and this was a

122
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:45,759
mathematical statistics program at UC

123
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,720
Berkeley and I was getting rather uh

124
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,680
distracted with mathematical uh

125
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,800
arguments and analysis and took a class

126
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,400
at the business school at Berkeley the

127
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,280
high school and that renewed my uh

128
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,120
passion basically for studying finance

129
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,000
and quantitative finance. Um I taught in

130
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,880
the statistics department at Harvard and

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,599
then joined the Sloan school where I

132
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,560
pursued research on financial

133
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,759
statistical modeling and finance. Uh

134
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:24,240
that led to interesting consulting

135
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,720
projects where one client uh hired well

136
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,080
wanted to hire me to work on a trading

137
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,520
program in international equities and we

138
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,280
ended up agreeing on becoming partners

139
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,880
rather than deciding how much I should

140
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,840
get paid for that. And so I worked uh

141
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,880
with hedge funds uh for a number of

142
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:50,000
years. um ultimately had the great

143
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:53,280
pleasure of uh working for ICOs, a hedge

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,800
fund in Cyprus, which is in the eastern

145
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,960
Mediterranean.

146
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,520
Um following that uh I came back to

147
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,759
academics actually to help with this

148
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,879
course uh now what 11 years ago or 12

149
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,560
years ago and had the great pleasure to

150
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:16,720
work with Vasili and Jake on this class.

151
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,199
And what I think is really important to

152
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,720
highlight is how the mathematics

153
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,479
lectures are teaching you mathematics

154
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,879
that's really quite practical and

155
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:31,759
useful. So um I like I I love

156
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,560
mathematics but I love I guess financial

157
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,599
uh applications even more. And so we'll

158
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:42,000
be stressing those tools that are useful

159
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:46,080
uh in financial modeling. Um I do think

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,680
it's important to emphasize the stature

161
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,480
of many of these guest lectures. Uh and

162
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,720
you're really going to be hearing from

163
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,160
uh people who are the top in the field

164
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,040
like John Hall. Many of you probably are

165
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,959
familiar with his work uh and Andrew

166
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:09,760
Lowe. Um and uh actually I had the

167
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:12,959
pleasure of teaching uh Tar and Lana uh

168
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:16,959
in statistics classes, one of which was

169
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:21,360
this. And uh what they've done is

170
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:25,680
created a new futures exchange

171
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,000
which is rather impressive. Um, when you

172
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,240
look at the history of the Commodity

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,200
Futures Trading Commission, there are

174
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,000
maybe, I don't know, 50 or so futures

175
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,240
exchanges that have come and gone. Uh,

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
maybe the most important is the Chicago

177
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,440
Merkantile Exchange. But here were two

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,080
students who uh basically create an

179
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,000
exchange where you bet on discrete

180
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,279
events, whether things will or will not

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,800
occur. And uh anyway, it's a it's a

182
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,200
great uh to have them join the class.

183
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,600
Well, um let's see with the different

184
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,040
statistics or math lectures, you can see

185
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,480
the range of topics. Um and these are

186
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,959
all uh lectures that introduce you to

187
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,480
these topics without much background. So

188
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,440
I think it provides an excellent

189
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,800
introduction to to the different topics.

190
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,680
Um, we will also be using uh the

191
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,040
language R in our studio for

192
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,399
illustrations. And I think most students

193
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:32,720
here probably are Python experts. I am

194
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:38,079
not a Python expert, so I use R. But let

195
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:42,399
me uh just tab over to

196
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:45,920
a slide showing this.

197
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,480
Let's see with using R. One of the

198
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,720
reasons for using R is that it gives you

199
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,040
immediate access to state-of-the-art

200
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,720
statistical methods that get developed

201
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,760
and but in addition to that it

202
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,560
facilitates the downloading and

203
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,760
collection of financial data from the

204
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,800
internet or from other sources that you

205
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,160
might have access to. uh but one can see

206
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:14,480
issues like nonlinear volatility models,

207
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:18,320
regime modeling, those are uh packages

208
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,680
that uh are quite useful and powerful.

209
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:25,839
Um in terms of sources of financial

210
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:29,120
data, everyone I'm sure looks at uh the

211
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:33,120
financial markets a bit and any data

212
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,959
that's available on Yahoo is importable

213
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:41,600
into R. Also the Federal Reserve

214
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:44,000
economic data base has all well around

215
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,839
80,000 different time series of

216
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,560
different rates. So um let's see we

217
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,000
distributed in the canvas site this R

218
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:59,680
notebook FM intro1

219
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:05,519
which basically uses um the R studio

220
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:09,200
cloud to uh collect data and display it.

221
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:12,079
And so this year um we have an

222
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,200
alternative to asking students to

223
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:19,360
install our desktop on their machines

224
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,920
but just to sign up to this uh R studio

225
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,880
cloud and you can basically with a

226
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:28,720
simple login create simple files which

227
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:33,839
we give you and display different uh

228
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:39,360
time series. So this um

229
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:42,800
this FM intro one uh R program

230
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,079
basically will dis collect and display

231
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,920
data and

232
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,480
you don't need to know anything except

233
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,279
to maybe update the dates for starting

234
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,399
and ending data collection.

235
00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:00,560
And so one can look at the S&P 500

236
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:04,399
index, the VIX index. Uh perhaps one of

237
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,959
the more important indexes in uh equity

238
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,760
markets is the VIX index, sort of a fear

239
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:14,880
gauge. And uh it turns out that the sort

240
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,360
of fear gauge tends to spike when the

241
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,680
market drops. And so there are

242
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,720
interesting uh relationships between

243
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,320
these that actually get formalized with

244
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,040
option pricing theory. And let's see

245
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,519
just for interest there's here's the

246
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,320
time series for Bitcoin.

247
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,120
Um the beginning of this time series is

248
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:41,519
about when our class began.

249
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:46,720
And if you were fortunate to be uh at

250
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:49,440
MIT at that time, uh an alum of MIT gave

251
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,360
all the incoming students, I think, $100

252
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,079
in Bitcoin.

253
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,480
And uh

254
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,279
many years later, some of them still had

255
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,760
their Bitcoin keys and could cash in.

256
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,480
Some uh were very regretful that they

257
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,199
somehow lost their their Bitcoin keys.

258
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:13,199
But it's really an interesting market.

259
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:15,600
Um I I was a complete skeptic back here.

260
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,160
Uh and I guess I'm still a complete

261
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,680
skeptic, but uh that being said, you

262
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,360
know, there's obviously great potential

263
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:27,600
there. Um here's the time series graph

264
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,720
of Nvidia. Um, curiously, in last year's

265
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,680
notes, we displayed Nvidia

266
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,040
and since then

267
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,480
it's risen rather dramatically. Um, a

268
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:44,399
really interesting topic for

269
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,680
analysis is the uh creation of bubbles

270
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,480
in financial markets and can you detect

271
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,639
a bubble and when it might uh might

272
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:59,680
burst very challenging. Um let's say one

273
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:03,839
last uh point to uh illustrate was the

274
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,240
crude oil futures contract. Um it's one

275
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,639
of the more popular futures contracts

276
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:14,480
traded. Um and what's rather striking is

277
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:18,160
that in 2020

278
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,959
the price of this contract went negative

279
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:25,760
significantly. And this was an event

280
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:28,720
that the brokers, important brokers,

281
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,560
didn't program in that possibility into

282
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:36,480
their systems. And so uh when the system

283
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:39,760
sort of became updated on this day when

284
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,360
the price was significantly negative um

285
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:48,480
those who held say thousands of

286
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:51,759
contracts of the contract actually uh

287
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,720
owed money to the exchange for their

288
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,199
negative position. Um anyway, the

289
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,880
financial markets offer these cases

290
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,720
where surprising seemingly impossible

291
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,639
events can occur such as negative

292
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,360
interest rates. When I was studying

293
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,680
finance u the thought of negative

294
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,920
interest rates was uh was just

295
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,880
considered um an impossibility. So um

296
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:21,199
with that um let's see I just want to

297
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:26,959
highlight this uh

298
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:32,160
our uh our studio uh

299
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:35,600
cloud um allows you just to log in with

300
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:39,040
just a username and password and it's

301
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,639
free and then you can create our

302
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,720
programs

303
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:48,240
and it should display

304
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:52,560
the R studio

305
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:57,120
running from the cloud. And so here is a

306
00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:01,600
directory in this cloud project which

307
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,959
has an RMD for our markdown file which

308
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:09,360
is displayed in the top left and that

309
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:13,360
simple program runs creates that HTML

310
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:17,520
file. So analyses are very easy to

311
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:20,240
illustrate with our studio and we I hope

312
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,240
to uh share with you various R programs

313
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,360
that you can use to replicate studies we

314
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,079
do in our lectures. All right. Um, let's

315
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,880
see. Finally, uh, let's see. We

316
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,679
distributed assignment zero today, which

317
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,640
is asking everyone to fill out a simple

318
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,520
survey of where you come from, what your

319
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,320
interests are, and to submit perhaps a

320
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,600
resume or CV if you have that accessible

321
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,600
so we can get to know all of you.
