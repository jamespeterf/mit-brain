1
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,359
Okay, today is our second and probably

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,800
last day of homogeneous dynamics and

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,600
projection theory. Um, let's remember

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,279
where we are and then we're going to uh

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,039
try to use the the things we learned

6
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,519
about last time to say something about

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,719
dynamics.

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:37,520
Okay. Um, so we'll have a league group

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:41,440
G, which so far is SL2R, and we have a

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,920
discrete subgroup, which so far has been

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,360
SL2Z,

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,520
and we're interested in GOD gamma.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,840
Um, we have a metric M, which is a right

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,480
invariant

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,039
metric

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,520
on G. and then

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,880
we get it leads to a metric that I also

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:13,720
call M and G mod gamma.

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,720
Okay. So now G also has a left action

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,759
on G mod gamma

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,280
and this left this left action does not

22
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,520
preserve the metric because the metric

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,920
is not left invariant. So this left

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,840
action distorts the metric and we

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,759
started to study that last time and it's

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,880
going to continue to be crucial how it

27
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,200
distorts the metric. Um but it preserves

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,200
the volume.

29
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,680
Okay.

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,680
Um

31
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:51,119
cool. Okay. Now uh inside of this group

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:55,399
we have the uh unitary group

33
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,399
uh sorry the unipotent group

34
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,479
let's say UT is one t and our goal is to

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,920
understand what how the unipotent orbits

36
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,760
in gamma look. So we're going to study

37
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:17,160
u dox

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,160
in gamma. So x is a gamma

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,840
and there's an an old theorem of

40
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,360
headland from the 30s

41
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,800
which is the the kind of thing about

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,879
about this orbit that we're interested

43
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,800
in that

44
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,040
u dox is either periodic

45
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,720
or dense.

46
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,920
We won't exactly prove that but we'll

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,080
prove some things that are a little bit

48
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,959
related.

49
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:49,200
Okay. Um, now the unipotent group is

50
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,720
special and the one way of getting our

51
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,400
hands on something special about it is

52
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,000
to see how it relates to diagonal

53
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,000
matrices. So let's say this

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,879
a sub is that matrix that diagonal

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,519
matrix in SL2R. And then acute

56
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:12,159
observation is that a subr u t a subr

57
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:13,920
inverse is u e to the 2r t.

58
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,319
Um it's just a computation with

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,720
matrices. Uh I've done it a couple times

60
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,920
and I start to sort of anyway doing it

61
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,840
in front of you I think is not very

62
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,239
useful but if you are interested in this

63
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,840
it's if you do it yourself it starts to

64
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:35,120
make sense. Uh okay.

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:40,799
So now let's say that u 0 t of x that

66
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:43,280
means the set of u t of x t is a zero t.

67
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,720
So if capital t is large this is a big

68
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,000
piece of an orbit and that's more or

69
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,319
less what we'd like to study. What is

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,319
the shape of a big piece of the orbit?

71
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:58,879
And this observation tells us that

72
00:03:52,319 --> 00:04:01,519
um u0 t of x is a r

73
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,680
u01

74
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,599
a r inverse of x.

75
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,480
Okay. And this is helpful because this

76
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,360
this u01 is much less intimidating than

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,959
u t. So this here is just a little piece

78
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,359
of the orbit. Um and so to understand a

79
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,880
big orbit we have to understand how this

80
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,520
a sub rar acts on a little orbit.

81
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,240
Um okay and another simple observation

82
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:34,880
is that a r is like a

83
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,000
little r to the j. So if big R is big J

84
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,440
* little R then we have this. Oh and in

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,880
in this equation by the way um E to the

86
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,759
2 big R is T.

87
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,280
Okay. So this a a r we can think of it

88
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,520
as a little r applied many times. Okay.

89
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,320
So therefore it makes sense that we

90
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,320
could just try to understand

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,000
how a little r acts on unipotent orbits.

92
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,680
Okay.

93
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,960
So, we made a picture of this at the end

94
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,280
of class last time with models and props

95
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,600
and everything. And uh and this picture

96
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,880
is is is uh the the the main tool that

97
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,720
we're going to think about for

98
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,479
homogeneous dynamics. So, I'm going to

99
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,240
draw this picture again and then we're

100
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:36,000
going to talk about why it why it is the

101
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:38,880
way we drew it. Um okay. So,

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,039
over here something a shape that I'll

103
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,560
draw as being kind of a cylinder. And

104
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,919
this is a fundamental domain. Um so so

105
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,280
this is either the whole fundamental

106
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,280
domain or maybe a tube in

107
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:58,440
in f. So f is sitting in the group g and

108
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,440
it's a fundamental domain

109
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:07,840
for g mod gap.

110
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:11,600
Okay. And so this length scale is one.

111
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,199
And this length scale um is also one. Or

112
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,440
we could also make it smaller if we'd

113
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,759
like to have a thinner tube.

114
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,319
All right. And now inside of this tube

115
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,280
are a bunch of pieces of unipotent orbit

116
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,280
that I'll draw like this.

117
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,720
Okay. So each of those is a piece of

118
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:43,440
unipotent orbit.

119
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:46,000
Um here is t = 0 and here is t = 1.

120
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,560
Okay. And now understand what is going

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,560
to happen to this picture when we apply

122
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,080
a subr.

123
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,759
So what we're going we're going to apply

124
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,039
um I guess strictly speaking l the the

125
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,639
we're going to apply it on the left.

126
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,400
We're going to multiply by a subar on

127
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,759
the left.

128
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Okay. So what's going to happen? Um

129
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,680
first of all the unipotent orbits are

130
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,280
going to stretch that way.

131
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,240
Then second of all, okay, so so so you

132
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,199
just think about what happens to the

133
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,800
cylinder. There's going to be a

134
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,800
direction where it stretches. There's

135
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,160
going to be a direction that compresses.

136
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,919
And there's going to be a direction that

137
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,039
stays the same. That will be true at

138
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,759
every point. Um, but what's important is

139
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,919
that the direction that compresses is

140
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,319
kind of not the same everywhere in this

141
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,160
picture. And so to illustrate that, I'm

142
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,479
going to draw what happens at at a

143
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,840
couple of different heights.

144
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,840
So at t = 1

145
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,919
this

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,680
um and there'll be some direction that

147
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:01,759
compresses maybe it's that direction and

148
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:05,599
so when we apply l a r inverse this disc

149
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,599
is going to be squished vertically

150
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,919
and when it's squished vertically

151
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,479
then we'll have a triangle that looks

152
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,479
sort of like so.

153
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:23,319
Okay. And also at t equals z we have the

154
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,319
same disc with the same triangle in it

155
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,240
but there's a compression direction

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,560
which is different. So maybe down here

157
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,120
it's this direction.

158
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:39,120
So when we apply

159
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:42,560
LA subar inverse um then we will get a

160
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,080
pancake who gets squished this way and

161
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,080
that will affect these points

162
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,440
differently.

163
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,600
This after squishing the green point and

164
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,240
the orange point will be quite close

165
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,920
together.

166
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,279
All right. So that's the picture that we

167
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,279
ended with last time.

168
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,040
And what is important here

169
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:12,040
key point

170
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,040
is that the compression direction

171
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,519
is twisting

172
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:26,760
relative to

173
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,760
the unipotent orbits.

174
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,320
Meaning that if at a given height two

175
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,200
unipotent orbits are being compressed

176
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,640
towards each other then at most other

177
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,640
heights uh they won't be.

178
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,120
All right. So this is where we left off

179
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:53,880
last time. Um are there questions or

180
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,880
comments about this picture?

181
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,279
Yeah.

182
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,279
>> So in the picture you had last week,

183
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,560
these after things are all kind of

184
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,320
stretched out and compressed, they're

185
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,200
then mapped back onto the fundamental

186
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,160
domain half. But if they've been twisted

187
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,000
around, like is there some are they kind

188
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,920
of mapped back onto F without twisting

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,680
in some way to make it all perfectly

190
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,920
line up or is there kind of some other

191
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,240
twisting that happens again as they get

192
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,800
back back on F?

193
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,040
>> Yeah. Yeah. Okay, that's a good

194
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,839
question. Let's So the question is about

195
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,600
um how this gets mapped back into the

196
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,920
fundamental domain. Let's try to draw

197
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,920
that also.

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,240
So here

199
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,959
here's our fundamental domain.

200
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:55,040
First we apply this map just in our

201
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:58,600
group and we get something which is tall

202
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,600
and flat

203
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:07,040
and perhaps it is twisted a little bit

204
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,640
between the bottom and the top. Um

205
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,320
um

206
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,560
okay anyway then that is going to get

207
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,839
mapped back into our domain. So pi is

208
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,560
the projection from g to gm mod gamma

209
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,480
and which gamma will identify with our

210
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,839
fundamental domain. So this thing is

211
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,680
going to get mapped back into the

212
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,320
fundamental domain. What does that look

213
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:33,040
like? Um, so the fundamental domain is

214
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,040
kind of sort of a unit cube,

215
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,320
but this thing is way taller than a unit

216
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:42,000
cube. So imagine cutting it into pieces

217
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,560
whose height is only around one.

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,560
Okay? And this was only ever around one.

219
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,040
So each of those pieces now is small

220
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,920
enough to fit in the fundamental domain.

221
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Um, and um

222
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,920
um let me call it piece one, piece two,

223
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,240
piece three, and piece four.

224
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,480
All right. Now, those are going to sort

225
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,720
of fold back into the fundamental

226
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,200
domain.

227
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,320
And at least roughly, I think it's good

228
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,320
to imagine it like this.

229
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,440
So each one of of these guys is

230
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,320
corresponds to one of those guys,

231
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,880
right? Okay. But they are not in order.

232
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,120
So it's not like they go 1 2 3 4.

233
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:32,480
They're in some um they're in some

234
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:34,800
order. uh one two three um so uh I don't

235
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,000
know much about about this order. I

236
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,920
personally don't know anything about

237
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
this order.

238
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,000
[Applause]

239
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,040
Okay. So now I think the question was

240
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,279
how would this picture look if this

241
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,279
thing were twisted a little bit. Um so

242
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,440
first of all you know when we say that

243
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,760
this thing is twisted a little bit it's

244
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,000
a change sort something like a change of

245
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,160
90 degrees or 180 degrees between the

246
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,920
bottom and the top and there are many

247
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,279
steps between the bottom and the top. So

248
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,920
that means if you just look at one of

249
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,079
these guys you don't notice or barely

250
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,440
notice any twisting. This thing is

251
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,800
basically a planer slab. Um, and then

252
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,839
these planer slabs are at slightly

253
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,160
different angles, but this map pi, it it

254
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,600
doesn't it doesn't exactly preserve. I

255
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,120
mean, those angles aren't exactly well

256
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,240
defined because this this is not living

257
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,240
in R3. So, it's actually not it's not

258
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,920
clear exactly what we mean when we say

259
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,680
that this slab and this slab are they

260
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,760
parallel or are they twisted compared to

261
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,680
each other?

262
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,000
Anyway, when they get mapped back in,

263
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,839
it's not I

264
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,839
I think that imagining this is is

265
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,839
reasonable.

266
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,399
Okay.

267
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,399
Um,

268
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,160
okay. Now, that raises a bit of a

269
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,399
question coming back to this picture

270
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,720
that people that that that we we were

271
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,720
trying to digest last time, like what

272
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,600
exactly do we mean when we say that the

273
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,000
compression angle is twisting?

274
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,920
Because the compression angle here lives

275
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,360
at one height, it lives over here, and

276
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,519
the compression angle there lives over

277
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,040
there. How do we compare an angle over

278
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:24,079
here with an angle over here? Uh given

279
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,199
that this is not R3, this is living in a

280
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,839
curved thing. Right? So I actually

281
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,199
rethought how to state it and I added

282
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,360
some words that I don't think I

283
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,800
mentioned last time.

284
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,600
I think when we talk about this

285
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:41,600
twisting, we need to include these words

286
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,399
relative to the unipotent orbits.

287
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,079
Okay. So let me try to make a more

288
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,320
precise statement about what this

289
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,000
twisting means and then we'll see how we

290
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,079
can do some computations in the league

291
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,079
group with matrices and and see that it

292
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,079
happens

293
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,030
[Applause]

294
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:24,320
All right. So, um,

295
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,279
okay. So, precise

296
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:31,399
statement

297
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,399
about what is twisting.

298
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,079
What is twisting?

299
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:43,839
Okay. So suppose I have a piece of

300
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,880
unipotent orbit in my fundamental domain

301
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,160
starts at G knot that's over there some

302
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:54,560
group element in my fundamental domain

303
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:58,399
and then over here I have UT of G KN and

304
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:02,320
T goes say from 0 to one.

305
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,959
Okay. Now at each point here there's

306
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,160
going to be a vector that compresses

307
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:12,959
when I perform ar.

308
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:18,720
So let's say v compression of t. This is

309
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:22,120
a a vector uh and this is the direction

310
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,120
that compresses

311
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,120
when we apply

312
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:35,519
left arce.

313
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,320
So it's the um so it's a it's a vector.

314
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,320
It lives in the tangent space of our

315
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:47,160
group at the given point.

316
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,160
and it's the smallest singular vector

317
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,759
for the derivative of this map.

318
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,279
Okay, so that's what we mean by the

319
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,759
compression direction.

320
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,919
Now, what does it mean relative to the

321
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:10,240
unipotent orbits?

322
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,480
So suppose that over here I have another

323
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,959
unipotent orbit

324
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,959
and it's this is like a nearby unipotent

325
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,959
orbit.

326
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:34,799
Okay. So this might be g plus epsilon *

327
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,679
v kn. epsilon * v is a little vector

328
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,200
that goes between these

329
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,280
starting points of these two nearby

330
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:47,039
unipotent orbits.

331
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:51,200
And up here or maybe here is ut of g

332
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:54,240
plus epsilon v kn. And here there's a

333
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,600
vector that goes between them. I guess

334
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:02,720
epsilon times

335
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:05,440
v orbit of t. So V orbit of T is going

336
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,320
in the direction of the from the red

337
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,320
orbit to the orange orbit.

338
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:18,480
Okay. So

339
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:21,520
so the the thing that is twisting is V

340
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,919
compression of T relative to V orbit of

341
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,200
T is twisting. The angle between those

342
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,480
two vectors is changing. That's the

343
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,559
precise statement of what is twisting.

344
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,240
And we can we can check what it's

345
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,760
happening by computing these two

346
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,280
vectors. Yeah,

347
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,600
>> you're conjugating technically, right?

348
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,559
Not just applying action. You're

349
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,160
conjugating, but when you say twisting,

350
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:51,799
you need to compare that some

351
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,799
if you apply the

352
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:59,200
apply the the gemic

353
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,679
you end up somewhere else.

354
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,280
I'm not sure if I understand comparison

355
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,400
twist.

356
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,039
>> Well, are you also following the body

357
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,039
orbit too?

358
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,039
>> Um,

359
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,160
right. So, the question has to do with

360
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,559
keeping track of things given that they

361
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,320
live in different tangent spaces. So,

362
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:25,120
okay. So, the compression direction is a

363
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,000
vector in the tangent space at the given

364
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,320
point along the orbit. Does that is that

365
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,320
okay so far?

366
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,320
>> Uh

367
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,520
yeah yeah yeah.

368
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,360
>> Okay. Um but then the comment is

369
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,440
you know if if I have a family of

370
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,760
vectors in one vector space then I can

371
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,160
say that they're twisted. But here I

372
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,720
have a family of vectors in a family of

373
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,120
vector spaces. And so it's not so clear

374
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,280
what it means that they're twisted. Um,

375
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,120
so I need to I need one way to do it is

376
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,960
to pick a reference vector to compare

377
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:04,000
them with. And so that's the job of the

378
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,640
of this V orbit vector which goes from

379
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,440
the red vector to this from the red

380
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,880
orbit to this orange orbit. And that's

381
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,080
like a a reference vector.

382
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,400
Um and then we'll see that so at each t

383
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,840
there's there's a orbit vector and a

384
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:26,120
compression vector and um the angle

385
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,120
between them is changing.

386
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,520
Okay.

387
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:36,880
Um cool. So, so there was a question

388
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,559
last class that basically was like

389
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,000
how are we sure that this is happening

390
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:45,919
this picture and the one way to be sure

391
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,919
is to compute these two vectors and then

392
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:52,919
and see that that they're not the same.

393
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,919
Okay.

394
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,919
Okay. So, let's compute them.

395
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,240
actually one of them we can comput.

396
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,240
[Applause]

397
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,840
So

398
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:19,440
ut is a matrix. So when we can we can

399
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:23,679
just multiply this through. This is ut

400
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:28,240
plus epsilon ut of v kn. And if we

401
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:32,120
compare sides we see that v orbit of t

402
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,120
is u subt.

403
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,730
Okay. Now let's figure out what v

404
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:46,099
compression of t is.

405
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:46,099
[Applause]

406
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,720
Okay. Um,

407
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:27,520
cool. So say we have some G knot and um

408
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:32,159
we're going to apply the left action of

409
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:36,080
a R inverse and that will move us to to

410
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,159
um a subr G.

411
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,559
And we want to understand how this map

412
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,120
is distorting the geometry of G knot,

413
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,640
the geometry near GN, and in particular

414
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,120
figure out which direction is being

415
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,600
compressed.

416
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Okay. Um, so I think the best the best

417
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,039
way I could figure out to understand

418
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,799
this is to put it in a picture uh with

419
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,559
connecting this thing that I don't

420
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,039
understand yet to some maps that are

421
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,440
easier to understand.

422
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,960
So here's the identity and from here to

423
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,080
here I could apply a right

424
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,520
multiplication by GMAT and right

425
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,840
multiplication is much easier to

426
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,760
understand because that's an isometry

427
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,919
and the identity also is kind of nicer

428
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,559
than other matrices.

429
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,480
Okay. And then I'm going to go back to

430
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,159
the identity.

431
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:29,520
So this is right multiplication by a r g

432
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,440
all inverse which is also an isometry.

433
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,440
So if you put this all together, I'm

434
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,600
going to have a map from the tangent

435
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,640
space of the identity to itself.

436
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,080
And that map is an isometry times the

437
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,320
map I want to understand times an

438
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,559
isometry. So that all of the metric

439
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:52,480
distortion is going to come from here.

440
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:56,000
Okay, now this map is not so hard to

441
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,039
understand. So if I apply what am I

442
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,480
doing? So I I start with some matrix H.

443
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:06,960
I right multiply by G knot. Then I left

444
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:10,960
multiply by A R then I right multiply by

445
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:14,159
the inverse of A R G KN. What do I get?

446
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,200
Well have h I might I multiply on the

447
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:20,000
right by G knot. Now I multiply on the

448
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,020
left by a r. Now I multiply on the right

449
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,760
by this.

450
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,120
[Applause]

451
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:31,720
Okay. When I invert this I switch those.

452
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,720
I get a g not inverse and they cancel.

453
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,600
So this operation is none other than

454
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:43,120
conjugating by a r. Right? So this is

455
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,480
the conjugation by ar.

456
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,960
Okay. So conjugation by a r is a map

457
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,919
from our new group to itself takes the

458
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,159
identity to the identity and therefore

459
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,000
this map or really its derivative takes

460
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,640
the tangent space of the identity to

461
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,200
itself.

462
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,880
All right and now you can write this

463
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,640
down. This a r is an explicit matrix uh

464
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,559
tangent a tangent vector here is a

465
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:14,240
matrix abcd.

466
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:17,600
So this is just a b c d goes to or d c a

467
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:24,480
r of this is

468
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:25,840
e r e minus r ab c d e minus r e

469
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,000
so this is a thing you can write down

470
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,679
it's not that scary and we worked out

471
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,760
last time uh what it does so recall from

472
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,440
last time

473
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,480
that we have first of all we have an

474
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:43,919
orthonormal basis of TE of G which are

475
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,840
there's a basis vector N 0 1 0 0. Last

476
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,360
time I called this U, but there were so

477
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,039
many U's on the blackboard that I was

478
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,880
worried it was not a great idea. So I'm

479
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,279
going to call it N. N for nil potent

480
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,360
which is also true.

481
00:25:53,279 --> 00:26:00,400
Um there's N tilda which is 0 1 0 0. And

482
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,640
there's a diagonal guy which looks like

483
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:07,120
this.

484
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:09,520
Okay. So what we figured out is that

485
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,960
the conjugation

486
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:16,880
makes n way bigger.

487
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:21,559
It makes n tilda way smaller

488
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,559
and it leaves the diagonal fixed.

489
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,600
Okay. So if I start at the identity and

490
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,120
I go all the way around, I'm doing this

491
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:43,080
conjugation and n tilda is the vector

492
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,080
that's going to get compressed.

493
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,240
But now if I want to know what vector

494
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,559
over here is going to get compressed,

495
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,240
well I start with antilda. I map it over

496
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,640
here. It hasn't gotten any shorter yet

497
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,240
because this is an isometry. That's the

498
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,400
vector that's going to be compressed in

499
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,400
this set.

500
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,320
Okay.

501
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:10,559
So it's the

502
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:13,919
right action by g of n tilda. This is

503
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:17,600
the singular vector

504
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:21,279
of d l a r inverse

505
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:25,320
with singular value

506
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,320
e to the minus 2r.

507
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:32,880
Okay. So that's basically the answer to

508
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:36,720
our question. So the V compress the

509
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,760
compression vector at T

510
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:44,679
that's R at so now I'm not necessarily

511
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,679
at the point GN but I'm at the point ut

512
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:55,720
of N tilda.

513
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,720
So that's n tilda ut g.

514
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,919
Okay. So now if you compare how these

515
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,399
two things are changing with T, you see

516
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,799
it is not the same because our group is

517
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,200
not commutative

518
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:18,640
because when you changing the orbit of

519
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,799
T, you're multiplying by UT on the left.

520
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,600
But when you're changing the compression

521
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,840
direction, you're multiplying by UT over

522
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,520
here in the middle. And it's a

523
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,120
non-commutative group. So those two

524
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,120
operations are not the same as each

525
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,120
other.

526
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,880
Oh um so I don't necessarily

527
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,720
think it will be helpful to do more

528
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,960
computations but I did some at home to

529
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,720
be sure and you know if if you imagined

530
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,520
that at time zero

531
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,760
the these two directions coincided and

532
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,120
then you see what happens as t changes.

533
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,080
You'll see that they stop coinciding.

534
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,600
>> Yeah.

535
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,600
>> So picking the inner product of the

536
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,919
vectors it makes sense as an operation

537
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,120
to do it to compare the angles in the

538
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,720
tangent space.

539
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,120
>> Yeah. Um that's right. So these are

540
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,000
vectors in a Romanian

541
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,760
manifold. um and so they have a well-

542
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,720
definfined angle and we can compute it

543
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:35,919
by taking inner products and and then um

544
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:39,360
uh right so I guess I guess we could say

545
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:41,760
that the coine of

546
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,960
uh

547
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:49,279
of the angle

548
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:52,399
between v of t and w of t

549
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,240
would be um

550
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:59,080
V.W

551
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,080
over norm of V norm of W.

552
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,000
I used to teach this a lot in 1802. I

553
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,919
think that's right. Um so we have

554
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
formulas for V and W. So we can compute

555
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:14,679
this and um it'll be a little messy but

556
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,679
we'll see that it is not constant in T.

557
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:22,640
[Applause]

558
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,640
Other questions or comments?

559
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Okay, so the first big goal that was the

560
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:36,320
first chunk of the class, the first big

561
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,799
goal of the class was to um check that

562
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,880
this picture happens

563
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,760
and then the second part of the class we

564
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,600
will uh discuss how to use this picture

565
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,559
to figure out stuff about a long

566
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:52,600
unipotent orbit.

567
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,600
Okay. So, let's switch gears.

568
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Okay.

569
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:36,559
Okay. So, let's call this tracking

570
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,960
the spread

571
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,960
of an orbit.

572
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:52,320
All right. So remember that we had this

573
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:54,320
u 0 t of x is a r

574
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,360
u01

575
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,279
a r inverse x. Let's call this guy x

576
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,200
tilda.

577
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,360
Okay.

578
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,760
Um

579
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,080
now this uh there was a discussion last

580
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,360
time you know what happens if this orbit

581
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,279
here is periodic

582
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,880
if this orbit here is periodic the

583
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,159
special thing that happens is that this

584
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,919
point X tilda will be deep in the cusp

585
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,519
and the deep in the cusp is sort of a

586
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,600
special case because we were imagining

587
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,000
that this was like a regular nice orbit

588
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,480
of length one but if it's deep in the

589
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,200
cusp it's sort of different.

590
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,519
So let's assume that X tilda is not deep

591
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,519
in the custom

592
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:45,080
and that's equivalent to saying that UX

593
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,080
is not close to periodic.

594
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:51,360
[Applause]

595
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,840
Okay. And let's break up R as capital J

596
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,960
times little R.

597
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:06,200
And uh so then I'm going to say that U.j

598
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:06,200
J is a little R to the J of U01 of X to

599
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,360
Okay. And I want to track how this thing

600
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,840
is spreading out through my homogeneous

601
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,320
space GM mod gamma. And we'll we're

602
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,200
going to track it by noticing how many

603
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:23,600
delta balls it takes to cover it. So

604
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:27,440
recall that X delta

605
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,120
is the minimum number of delta balls

606
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,760
needed

607
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,760
to cover X.

608
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,519
So our goal is going to be to estimate

609
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,679
U.j J delta um

610
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,640
in terms of J

611
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,640
delta and R.

612
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,000
Okay. And for for context for reference

613
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,919
um the we have a three-dimensional

614
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,600
space. So for the whole space the number

615
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,720
of delta balls that we need to cover it

616
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,720
is delta to the minus 3.

617
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Okay.

618
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,560
All right. So, next of all,

619
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,280
our U.J is like a bunch of these

620
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,280
unipotent orbits.

621
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,200
Looks like that. And so, you might

622
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,119
notice that

623
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,280
it only really matters what the top

624
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,159
cross-section looks like. All the other

625
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,560
cross-sections are similar. So let's

626
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,839
take that top part down. Inside of

627
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:51,879
there, we see this. So let's call that

628
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:51,879
XJ. That's the top cross-section

629
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,480
of U.J.

630
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,000
And um then it's not hard to check that

631
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,599
U.j delta is like delta inverse time XJ

632
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,520
delta.

633
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,960
have uh

634
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,800
cut it into slabs of thickness delta.

635
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,720
For each thickness, the number of delta

636
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,560
balls that we need to cover that slab is

637
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:19,359
xj delta. This is the number of slabs.

638
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:23,839
Okay. So, so basically we want to track

639
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,599
how xj delta depends on delta.

640
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,320
So,

641
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,320
so fully spread

642
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,839
or maybe I'll say very spread.

643
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,040
Um, that means that

644
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,440
u.j delta is like delta to the minus3.

645
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,720
That would be like saying xj delta is

646
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:48,240
like delta to the minus 2. That xj

647
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,800
really fills a lot of the disc.

648
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,280
Okay.

649
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:57,040
So now

650
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,040
how does this picture help us to study

651
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,040
XJ?

652
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,079
So using the key picture.

653
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,760
All right.

654
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,760
So um

655
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:38,079
so let me label these maps pi 1 and pi 0

656
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:42,960
and somewhere in the middle we would

657
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:47,640
have pi t. Pi t is what our map ar is

658
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,640
doing to the slice at height t.

659
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,680
Okay, using the key picture

660
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,839
have a lama.

661
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,480
So if

662
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:05,119
e to the minus 2r is delta

663
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,960
then

664
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:14,160
um

665
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:19,800
xj + 1 delta is around a sum over t of

666
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,800
pi t of xj delta.

667
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:28,960
And which t's do we sum over? The t's

668
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:31,960
are in delta z and t goes from zero to

669
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,960
one.

670
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,839
Um this is al we can also write this as

671
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:45,040
delta inverse times the average

672
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:50,760
t between zero and one

673
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,760
of pi t of xj delta.

674
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,320
Okay. So, proof sketch.

675
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,160
Um,

676
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,480
okay.

677
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:15,000
So, here is our fundamental domain. Cut

678
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:15,000
it into slices of thickness delta.

679
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,480
So here's a slice at height t with

680
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:26,400
thickness delta.

681
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:30,040
Okay. Now when we apply l, we uh stretch

682
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,040
it up vertically

683
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,480
and we compress it in some other

684
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:41,119
direction. We get something like this.

685
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:43,520
And then we divide this into pieces at

686
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:48,079
different heights.

687
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,640
And let me color this particular

688
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,800
slab in red.

689
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,800
So that red one is one of them over

690
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,800
here.

691
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,920
So this these are each of height one.

692
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,000
Okay. Um

693
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,520
right.

694
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,560
So in this new picture there will be so

695
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,280
in the in the old picture there were

696
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,280
some unipotent orbits

697
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,440
that went through our slab.

698
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,680
Um so x describes where the unipotent

699
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,720
orbits hit the top of our slab. And now

700
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,040
we apply this map and now there will be

701
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:45,200
some points over here in the top of this

702
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:51,079
slab. And who will they be? Those points

703
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,079
over there would be pi t of x.

704
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,839
Okay. Now we want to cover things with

705
00:39:53,839 --> 00:40:01,359
delta balls. So this distance here is e

706
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:04,480
to the minus 2r. So that's delta. So we

707
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:07,760
want to know how many delta balls does

708
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,599
it take to cover

709
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,200
that.

710
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:17,240
So that number there is delta covering

711
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,240
number of pi t of xj.

712
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,680
Right?

713
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:28,400
So over over here we started with xj.

714
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:34,280
Now what happens when we apply pi?

715
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,280
Each of these slabs gets folded back in.

716
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,760
Okay. Um and um the red one went

717
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:48,200
somewhere. I don't really know where,

718
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,200
but maybe it went over here.

719
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:58,720
And here in the top of it is pi t of xj

720
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:03,119
and it's delta covering number.

721
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:05,920
So the number of delta balls

722
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:12,280
in this strip

723
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:12,280
that would be um pi t of xj.

724
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:22,720
Okay. And now the uh this thing these

725
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:26,400
dots up here are are xj + one. It's the

726
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,079
set of set of dots on the top face. And

727
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,560
so how many delta balls do we need to

728
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,359
cover them? Well, for these ones we

729
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,920
needed pixj delta covering number and

730
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,480
and these other guys those corresponded

731
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:42,119
to different um slabs here. So there are

732
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,119
different terms in this.

733
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:03,040
Okay.

734
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:06,079
Um so now

735
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,800
we can try to use projection theory to

736
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,920
study this thing and it will tell us how

737
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:15,800
the covering number XJ + 1 delta evolves

738
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,800
as we increase J.

739
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:28,280
[Applause]

740
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,280
Any

741
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,720
question? Yeah.

742
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,960
>> Why do

743
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,720
the delta balls start to overlap when J

744
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,440
is large enough and kind of the

745
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,680
compression is more than delta? Because

746
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,240
delta is kind of the size of one round

747
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:51,040
of compression. If you do multiple, why

748
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:54,040
would it be for that?

749
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,040
Um

750
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,440
so I think the question is suppose at

751
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:07,599
the beginning that there happened to be

752
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:10,400
two guys here in X whose distance was

753
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:14,880
less than delta which might happen

754
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,680
>> then um what would happen to them?

755
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,160
Um

756
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,480
>> well

757
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:23,040
>> not that they're less than delta

758
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,920
slightly more than delta

759
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:31,440
but less than

760
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:34,800
eus 2r or e to the 2 r delta so that in

761
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:38,560
the in f they're in the same delta b

762
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,880
then applying the transformation

763
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,400
diagonal transformation that they're

764
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,400
then then they become in a delta

765
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,960
But before they're not in before they're

766
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,800
in two separate delta balls after the

767
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,119
transformation of one delta ball.

768
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,680
>> Right. Right. Okay. So it could happen

769
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:59,280
that we have two guys like maybe these

770
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:03,119
two guys are pretty far apart but after

771
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,480
we perform um pi t they got squished

772
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,200
together and they're now in the same

773
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,240
delta ball over here. Yeah that could

774
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,480
that could happen. And the the main

775
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,319
thing we have to study is how often that

776
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,119
happens.

777
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:21,680
Um but um

778
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:24,079
this lema is still true. Um

779
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:28,240
this might be a lot smaller than xj

780
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:31,200
delta because many many uh points that

781
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,319
were far apart in xj may have gotten

782
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,000
squished together in pi t of xj.

783
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:40,560
But this is just the number of delta

784
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,760
balls that it takes to cover um

785
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,760
the the image there.

786
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:56,079
>> Does that answer your question?

787
00:44:52,480 --> 00:45:01,200
>> Yeah. I guess also like in the third

788
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:02,720
image like why is each delta ball

789
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,640
contained in only the size of one of

790
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:09,440
those kind of strips?

791
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:12,960
>> Ah okay. So we we tuned delta and r to

792
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,599
play together so that we picked r so the

793
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,000
thickness of this strip is delta. I

794
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:21,520
thought if the transformation is applied

795
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,280
multiple times then you get multiple

796
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:30,000
like e to the minus 2 r j scaling.

797
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,760
>> Um that's not wrong but when we apply it

798
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,400
multiple times we're not changing little

799
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,359
r we're just applying a subr a sub

800
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,359
little r multiple times. So so this

801
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,640
picture is describing what happens in in

802
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,720
one time

803
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,160
>> and then you could use this in many

804
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,680
rounds. So you could use this lama over

805
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,640
and over again.

806
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,200
>> Okay,

807
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:52,200
>> which which is what we'll do.

808
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,200
Okay.

809
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,599
Um,

810
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,760
let me change my notation a little bit.

811
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,680
Um,

812
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,920
so I was using the letter pi for this

813
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,839
maybe a little bit prematurely. What's

814
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,880
clear so far is that this is a map. So

815
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:32,359
I'm going to call it f_sub_1, f_t, and

816
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,359
f0. And so then I'll change this.

817
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:42,319
Okay.

818
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:44,720
[Applause]

819
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,960
Okay. So now the next remark is that

820
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:50,640
these maps look a lot like linear

821
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:53,440
projections. So remark

822
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,240
ft is kind of approximately an

823
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:01,839
orthogonal projection

824
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:04,400
um pi t. So let me make a picture. So ft

825
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:07,359
does something like this.

826
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:11,920
And this thickness is delta. This is

827
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:15,960
one. Um and then pi t would just be an

828
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,960
actual orthogonal projection.

829
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,080
Okay. Um

830
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,680
so

831
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:28,839
[Applause]

832
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,839
uh ft is not not perfectly linear

833
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,520
uh but it is smooth.

834
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:43,280
Okay.

835
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,839
So now here is a proposition or exercise

836
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,720
about projections

837
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,480
says that if x is in the unit ball in

838
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:54,400
the plane.

839
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:57,920
Then if you take the average overall

840
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:03,440
directions theta and s1

841
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:09,560
of um pi theta of x delta

842
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:09,560
is at least as big as x delta to the 12.

843
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,960
Here's an example that shows where the x

844
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,960
delta to the 1/2 comes from.

845
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,359
So here's the unit ball and then inside

846
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,599
of it I take a smaller ball and I call

847
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:26,599
that X.

848
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:34,960
So X is the ball of some small radius

849
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:37,920
row inside of the ball of radius one.

850
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:41,559
Um okay then when I perform an

851
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,559
orthogonal projection

852
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:48,559
there's pi theta of X in any direction

853
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:52,400
I'll get a line of length row.

854
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:55,200
So I see that x delta is like row over

855
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:59,839
delta squared

856
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:02,640
and pi theta of x delta covering up is

857
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:05,359
like row over delta. So this is the

858
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,839
square root of that.

859
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:10,640
Okay. And this is the best thing to do.

860
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,880
Um you could devise an example where in

861
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,880
one particular direction the compression

862
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:19,359
is much smaller than the square root.

863
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,920
Um, here's an example like that.

864
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,920
B1,

865
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:28,559
here's X,

866
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:32,559
here's theta. Okay, in this example, pi

867
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:35,599
theta of X delta is much smaller. I'll

868
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:41,480
call this theta KN much smaller than X

869
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:41,480
delta to the 12 for one theta KN.

870
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,640
But at least in this picture, the most

871
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,440
of the projections are way bigger.

872
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:52,400
Okay, so it's not not super difficult uh

873
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,880
to check this proposition. And I'm going

874
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,720
to make it an exercise. I think we're

875
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,720
out of problem sets, but if we weren't,

876
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,720
this is a a nice one to review the

877
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,720
class.

878
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,559
Okay. And another comment is even though

879
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,400
these FTs are not exactly linear maps so

880
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,920
that we cannot just literally apply this

881
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,160
proposition they're close enough that by

882
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,400
using the proof of this you you can get

883
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,720
it for FT2.

884
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:22,720
So remark

885
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:27,400
the proof applies

886
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,400
to FT also.

887
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,280
Okay.

888
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:38,079
So if we put together this lema and this

889
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:42,440
proposition, we'll get an estimate about

890
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,440
the delta covering number of XJ.

891
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:02,240
Okay. So correlary if we put these

892
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:06,720
together xj + 1 delta covering number is

893
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:10,680
at least around um delta inverse time xj

894
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,680
delta to the 12

895
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:18,720
um proof.

896
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:23,280
So xj + 1 delta is

897
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:28,640
uh is at least by our lema delta inverse

898
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:34,880
times the average over t of xj

899
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:38,559
of um ft of xj delta

900
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:42,800
and then by our proposition that's at

901
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:47,160
least delta inverse time xj delta to the

902
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,160
on half and that's the proof.

903
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:53,520
Okay. So then let's just track what this

904
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:55,599
means. So x0 delta would be one. Think

905
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,079
about what x0 delta means. It's one

906
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,760
unipotent orbit. There's okay. So

907
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,800
therefore

908
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,960
x1 delta would be at least around delta

909
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:09,119
inverse.

910
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:12,440
x2 delta would be at least around delta

911
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,440
to the minus3s.

912
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:19,839
X3 delta be at least around delta to the

913
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:22,559
minus1 and 3/4

914
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:26,200
and so on and you'd get pretty close to

915
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,200
delta to the minus2.

916
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,599
Okay. And delta to the minus2 would be

917
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,599
like a definite fraction of the whole

918
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,599
space.

919
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:42,400
All right. Um, so this proves that a

920
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,079
unipotent orbit that's not close to

921
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,359
periodic,

922
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:50,480
it proves that it fills up a lot of the

923
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:53,280
homogeneous space.

924
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,280
It's not Headland's theorem. Um, hold on

925
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,839
a second. So, we didn't prove yet that

926
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,400
the orbit is dense. The orbit could be

927
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:01,839
missing an entire ball that's like half

928
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,839
the size of the space, and this could

929
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:07,200
still be true, but we did prove that the

930
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:09,440
orbit goes a lot of places. Yeah. Um and

931
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,760
this proof like does apply since

932
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,000
applying it each time loses some sort of

933
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,839
implicit constant like how do we know

934
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,599
that it's not becoming dense and just

935
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:22,079
like kind of an infinite decimally small

936
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:25,079
region of this full space.

937
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,079
Um

938
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,119
right so I think the question is like we

939
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,280
we didn't actually get to a constant

940
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,200
times delta to the minus 2 and if I

941
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,040
tried to do this sort of infinitely many

942
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,359
times I would be losing a constant each

943
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:40,400
time. Yeah, that's right. So, you know,

944
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:43,119
imagine doing this 10 times and we get

945
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,599
delta to the minus 1.99

946
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,240
and and that's what the method uh proves

947
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,079
so far. So, stronger things are true,

948
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,520
but but this method doesn't prove them

949
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,119
yet.

950
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,440
Um

951
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:59,720
so remark

952
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,720
um this doesn't show

953
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,640
that the orbit is uh is actually dense

954
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,800
and so

955
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,520
uh so maybe a question you know could

956
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:14,800
the orbit

957
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:17,119
do this

958
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,920
so here's our homogeneous space there's

959
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:23,520
a cusp but it's not that important

960
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:26,720
and and the orbit like goes around a

961
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:29,440
good bit, but it only ever goes around

962
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,880
over here and it never goes over there.

963
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,640
So, this proof doesn't say anything

964
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:37,920
about that.

965
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:39,760
Um, okay. So, as far as I know, the to

966
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:42,319
finish Headland's theorem requires

967
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,920
another step uh that is based on

968
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:47,520
different ideas from these ideas. Um, so

969
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,000
there's more to homogeneous dynamics

970
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:53,640
than than this story. Uh but this we did

971
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,640
still learn something interesting.

972
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,400
>> Yeah.

973
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,559
>> Do you know like how close it's possible

974
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:13,240
to get to the full theorem by trying to

975
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:13,240
optimize all the constants in this term?

976
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,960
>> Um okay. So there are two things that we

977
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,480
might like to improve here. So the

978
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,800
question is how how close can we get to

979
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,960
the full theorem by optimizing the

980
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,640
argument that we've been talking about.

981
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,480
So one thing that you might like is you

982
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,240
might like to actually get to delta to

983
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,839
the minus2.

984
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:34,319
Um that still wouldn't necessarily rule

985
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:36,160
out this possibility but it would be

986
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:39,920
interesting.

987
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:42,880
And um if you look

988
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,200
if you look at this proposition,

989
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,119
one thing that you you sort of notice

990
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,520
that this proposition is sharp in this

991
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:51,839
very clumped case. And if you remember

992
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:55,599
back to the early months of our class,

993
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:58,400
if X was not so compressed, then there

994
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:01,200
would be even better estimates. So if if

995
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,680
you knew as an input that X is not too

996
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,920
clustered, then you could get all the

997
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:09,760
way to delta to the minus 2 in one step

998
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:11,680
or or two steps or something. Um and so

999
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,680
you might try to track that. You might

1000
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,440
try to track not just the delta covering

1001
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:17,359
number but also the row covering number

1002
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,559
for different delta and row. And then

1003
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:22,000
you could take advantage of this

1004
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:26,240
clustering. And um I am not positive but

1005
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:29,359
I think it is a reasonable 18156 project

1006
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:33,410
uh to you try to use that to get all the

1007
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:35,119
way to delta to the minus 2.

1008
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:37,359
[Applause]

1009
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:40,960
Even if you got a constant times delta

1010
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:43,599
to the minus 2, it would

1011
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,200
still not be obvious to me that you

1012
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:49,520
filled the entire manifold and that

1013
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:51,119
you're not missing a ball. And um I I

1014
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,599
thought about it yesterday and today and

1015
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,119
I I don't have I don't have a good

1016
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:59,760
understanding yet of what you need to to

1017
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:01,680
to get everywhere. Um so I would be

1018
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:06,359
interested to learn if people have

1019
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:06,359
thoughts about it or know about it.

1020
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:13,119
Okay,

1021
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:15,040
cool. Um so I think that there actually

1022
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,040
are a bunch of ways to prove Headlland's

1023
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:21,680
theorem and this is not one that I have

1024
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:24,079
seen in the literature. Um and

1025
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,000
all all of these problems become more

1026
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:29,760
difficult and maybe more interesting

1027
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,760
when you go to higher dimensions. Um so

1028
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,359
the projection theory also becomes more

1029
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,760
difficult and more interesting in higher

1030
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:37,680
dimensions. And I wanted in the last

1031
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,720
part of the class to just show you what

1032
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:43,280
happens. Um and in particular we will

1033
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,799
see a new question about projection

1034
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,640
theory that we haven't mentioned so far

1035
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:49,280
in this class but which I think is a

1036
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,280
really cool question.

1037
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:54,280
Um,

1038
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,280
okay.

1039
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,070
[Applause]

1040
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,280
Okay.

1041
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,280
So that I'm going to put this way. What

1042
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,280
about

1043
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,400
SLNR?

1044
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,880
Right.

1045
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:34,000
Okay.

1046
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:36,640
Um so I'm going to take a somewhat

1047
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,920
specific example although I think most

1048
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,720
of what we'll say then would work for

1049
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:42,400
any N. So for example, we could have

1050
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:48,240
SL3R

1051
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:52,319
for our G. Gamma could be SL3 Z. And U

1052
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:56,119
could be the unipotent group of matrices

1053
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:56,119
that look like this.

1054
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,559
So the so from what I understand there

1055
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,960
are several different one parameter

1056
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:06,559
unipotent subgroups of SL3R. They're

1057
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,799
slightly different from each other. And

1058
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,640
this one is sort of particularly well

1059
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:12,240
studied in the homogeneous dynamics

1060
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:14,240
community because it's the one that

1061
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:17,040
comes up in the Oppenheim conjecture

1062
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:19,359
about quadratic forms.

1063
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:22,079
Um, okay. But anyway, so we have this

1064
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:25,040
one parameter subgroup. And so let's

1065
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:27,839
call this u subt.

1066
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:30,480
Okay. So our basic setup with like

1067
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:33,359
conjugating by a diagonal matrix that

1068
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:36,640
works. And the relevant diagonal matrix

1069
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:39,680
is this matrix.

1070
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:44,079
Okay. And then you can check that a subr

1071
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:46,720
u subt a sub r inverse is u sub e to the

1072
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:52,160
rt turns out to be e to the rt not e to

1073
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:54,000
the 2 rt but that's not too big a deal.

1074
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:58,760
Okay.

1075
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,760
So now um

1076
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:05,160
we have a bunch of unipotent orbits like

1077
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,160
before.

1078
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,280
There's a bunch of unit potent orbits,

1079
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:19,200
but um the dimension of our group is

1080
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:22,079
eight instead of three. And so we have

1081
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:24,559
the direction along the orbits t = 0 up

1082
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,640
to t= 1. That's still onedimensional. So

1083
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:29,599
this thing here is a seven-dimensional

1084
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:35,839
ball instead of a disc.

1085
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:37,920
Okay. So now we apply uh we study

1086
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:42,400
the action

1087
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:45,440
of L a r inverse and we'll have a

1088
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:48,440
picture like this

1089
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,440
f1

1090
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:55,119
f0

1091
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:58,799
um and okay something here will happen

1092
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,799
and something different here will

1093
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:07,400
Um okay. So you can study the singular

1094
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,400
values

1095
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:14,160
the singular values

1096
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:16,480
of l a r inverse and those are equal to

1097
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:19,680
the singular values

1098
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,920
of conjugation by a r. So conjugation by

1099
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,440
a r is is a very nice operation on

1100
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,680
matrices. You can write it down and see

1101
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:29,119
what happens. And you can compute these

1102
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:37,200
singular values and they are as follows.

1103
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:41,280
Um eus 2r eus r eus r 1 1 e to the r e

1104
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:42,960
to the r e 2 r.

1105
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,079
I won't do it on the board but I promise

1106
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,319
it's not hard.

1107
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:51,119
Okay. Now one of these singular values

1108
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:55,200
corresponds to the u direction.

1109
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:57,839
So little n is the vector that's the

1110
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:01,200
tangent vector

1111
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:04,559
to the group u at the identity.

1112
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:06,880
Um and so little n is it's not super

1113
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:08,480
important what the formula is but if you

1114
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,839
differentiate that you'll see that the

1115
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:15,040
tangent vector is that and that's one of

1116
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:18,000
these guys.

1117
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:21,920
So as before the direction of the orbits

1118
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:26,000
is expanding and then on the B7 we have

1119
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:30,079
the other seven uh directions. So this

1120
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:37,280
thing over here is an ellypoid

1121
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:41,559
with axes eus 2 r eus r eus r 1 1 e to

1122
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,559
the r e 2 r

1123
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,359
okay

1124
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,040
so as we go from here to here these fs

1125
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:51,119
are not exactly linear but they're close

1126
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:52,960
to linear they're close to linear maps

1127
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,720
and they stretch some directions and

1128
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,880
they compress other directions by these

1129
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,880
amount

1130
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:05,960
Okay.

1131
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:05,960
So what is different from before?

1132
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:14,319
Okay. One difference is that this thing

1133
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:17,319
is not exactly a projection.

1134
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:17,319
Um

1135
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:31,920
um

1136
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,920
but that's not the most important

1137
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,920
difference.

1138
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:41,079
Um so differences from last time

1139
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,799
Right? So if we had like an approximate

1140
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:54,480
projection

1141
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:58,720
that went from the seven ball to some

1142
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:00,319
vector space V of dimension three say so

1143
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,760
four dimensions are getting squished and

1144
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:05,680
three dimensions are staying as they

1145
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:10,880
are. That would sort of be approximately

1146
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:14,240
a linear map with singular values

1147
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:17,839
e to the minus r e to the minus r eus r

1148
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:20,480
e the minus r 1 one one right if I had a

1149
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:23,119
linear map like that these guys are

1150
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,720
almost zero so these are the four

1151
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:25,760
directions that are being squished these

1152
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,240
are the three directions that are

1153
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,160
staying the same the sing list of

1154
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,160
singular values here is not quite like

1155
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,799
that some of them are bigger than one we

1156
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:36,880
didn't have that before and the ones

1157
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:38,400
that are some of them are equal to one

1158
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,960
the ones that are smaller than one have

1159
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:43,039
two different scales. So that's a little

1160
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,359
bit more complicated but I don't want to

1161
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:46,960
focus on it.

1162
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,640
Um

1163
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,880
so

1164
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:53,880
our singular values are a little more

1165
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,880
complicated.

1166
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:01,520
[Applause]

1167
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:03,280
Okay let's ignore that. Suppose each of

1168
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,119
these linear maps actually had those

1169
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,559
singular values. So it was more like

1170
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,880
what we were used to in projection

1171
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:11,039
theory. There would be a different there

1172
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,200
would be another difference from before

1173
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:17,280
which is more important.

1174
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:20,880
So number one number two we still have

1175
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:24,760
only a one parameter family

1176
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,760
of linear maps.

1177
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:33,200
All right. So before when we talked

1178
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:35,359
about projections from B7 to V to

1179
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,200
threedimensional vector space, we talked

1180
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:39,599
about like all of them. If you look at

1181
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,200
all of the projections from B7 to

1182
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:43,680
threedimensional vector spaces, then

1183
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:46,160
something nice happens most of the time.

1184
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:50,319
But we don't have all of them. We just

1185
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:55,280
have a very thin subf family.

1186
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:58,280
So this is not all of the projections.

1187
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,280
Cool.

1188
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,920
Okay. So, um there's also a cosmetic

1189
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:05,119
complication that seven is a lot of

1190
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,440
dimensions and there are a lot of

1191
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,280
numbers. Um that but that that's not

1192
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,240
that important. It's just a pain. But

1193
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,839
but but these are this to some extent

1194
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,400
and this is a really fundamental

1195
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:18,480
conceptual difference.

1196
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,799
Um so I wanted to show you not this

1197
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,280
problem but the simplest problem of this

1198
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:24,960
type

1199
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:27,320
which is called the restricted

1200
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:31,219
projection problem.

1201
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:31,219
[Applause]

1202
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,319
All

1203
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:06,799
right. So this question which I think is

1204
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:13,119
is is a cool question was raised by Fler

1205
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:16,559
Katrine Fler and Thomas Orpinan in 2013

1206
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:19,599
and the question is like this. So here's

1207
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,960
the two sphere.

1208
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:24,000
So we're going to be doing projection

1209
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,440
theory in three dimensions in R3. So the

1210
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,039
different directions are parameterized

1211
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,039
by the two sphere. But we're not going

1212
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:32,799
to project in all of them. We're just

1213
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:35,440
going to pick some curve gamma and

1214
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:39,760
project in the directions of gamma. So

1215
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:41,359
gamma contained in s2 is a curve.

1216
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:46,000
Okay,

1217
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:48,799
the question is like this. um if X is

1218
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:53,440
contained in the unit three ball and

1219
01:07:48,799 --> 01:07:54,880
let's say X is a delta SC set we'll put

1220
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,359
to make it interesting we put some kind

1221
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,880
of non-conentration condition and this

1222
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:00,960
is the one that they had in their paper

1223
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:06,119
basically

1224
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:06,119
okay then estimate

1225
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:12,880
the average

1226
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:17,120
over all the directions in gamma

1227
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:21,679
of the of pi theta of x delta cover

1228
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:24,960
remember okay so pi so theta is a

1229
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:28,159
direction an element of s2 and pi theta

1230
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,319
is the orthogonal projection from r3 to

1231
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:33,560
theta per so from three dimensions to

1232
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,560
two dimensions

1233
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:39,440
so estimate the average of that

1234
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:42,400
seeh

1235
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:44,319
I erased the wrong thing okay on this

1236
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,319
very boring. Not two minutes ago, there

1237
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:49,359
was a proposition. It said if you had a

1238
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:51,120
set in R2 and you projected it in all

1239
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:52,560
the different angles, then on average

1240
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,920
the delta covering number of the

1241
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,400
projection was at least something or

1242
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:59,120
another. So this is like an analog of

1243
01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:01,520
that in three dimensions for a set with

1244
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:02,960
the spacing condition, but with the key

1245
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,440
difference that we're not averaging over

1246
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:09,759
all of them. We're only averaging over

1247
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:11,920
the ones in a particular curve gamma.

1248
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:13,920
Okay. Now an interesting thing about

1249
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,640
this question is that it matters what

1250
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,080
the curved gamma is. And in particular

1251
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:20,640
there's a big difference between an

1252
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:23,679
equator which is sort of like a straight

1253
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:26,640
line on the sphere and a non- degenerate

1254
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:29,600
or curved gamma.

1255
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,279
So the answer

1256
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,080
depends

1257
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:39,199
on whether gamma gamma is the equator is

1258
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:41,279
one extreme or gamma non- degenerate

1259
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:43,040
is another extreme.

1260
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:44,640
Um instead of writing the definition of

1261
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:47,440
non- degenerate let me just give you one

1262
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,920
example of a non- degenerate curve. So

1263
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:53,120
an example of a non- degenerate curve is

1264
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:56,000
gamma is equal to the set of theta in

1265
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:59,400
s2. So that the third component of theta

1266
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,400
is a half.

1267
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,760
So it looks like a the boundary of a

1268
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:10,400
spherical cap like that.

1269
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,600
Okay. So let me show you how these are

1270
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:16,109
different from each other.

1271
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,109
[Applause]

1272
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:40,400
Okay. So, example

1273
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:42,000
say gamma is the equator and s is two.

1274
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:45,040
So, we have a sort of a quote unquote

1275
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,520
two-dimensional set a delta 2 set. Okay.

1276
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:51,400
So, our set x is going to be a delta by

1277
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:51,400
one by one slab.

1278
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,920
So that looks

1279
01:10:56,159 --> 01:11:01,280
okay. And so imagine that the the um the

1280
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,360
two big directions are in the plane of

1281
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,880
the blackboard and the slab is sticking

1282
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:08,000
out of the blackboard by a little bit

1283
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,520
delta. Okay. Now there's an equator of

1284
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,239
directions that we're going to project

1285
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:14,159
in. And think of that as the equator

1286
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,920
that's like uh the sphere was centered

1287
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:17,120
at the blackboard. You intersected the

1288
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,800
sphere with the blackboard you would get

1289
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,960
a circle.

1290
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:24,640
So

1291
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:26,960
here's gamma. So now if theta is in

1292
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:31,600
gamma

1293
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:33,440
then the projection of x is a delta by

1294
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,040
one rectangle.

1295
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,679
So there's a circle of directions where

1296
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:41,400
if you project this slab you just get a

1297
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:41,400
delta by one rectangle.

1298
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:54,239
Okay. So then we see that the average

1299
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:57,239
uh pi theta of x delta is like delta

1300
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:57,239
inverse.

1301
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,679
Okay.

1302
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:11,440
Okay. Now, there's no obvious version of

1303
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:14,320
this example where where gamma is that

1304
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:16,960
curve that's up nearer the top.

1305
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:19,600
And the difference is so you know if

1306
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,679
you're if you're projecting in in a

1307
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:24,560
certain direction then the fibers are

1308
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:26,400
like lines in that direction. And so

1309
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:28,800
what's special here is that all of these

1310
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:31,280
lines are co-planer. And so you could

1311
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:33,360
have a kind of planer object that has a

1312
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:36,800
lot that that p where these lines

1313
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:39,199
intersected a lot. And instead, when we

1314
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:42,080
have those directions, then all of our

1315
01:12:39,199 --> 01:12:43,679
lines make an angle of 45 degrees with

1316
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,760
the horizontal. They're like light

1317
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:49,040
cones.

1318
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:51,040
And these just don't fit together in the

1319
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:54,560
same nice way that co-planer lines fit

1320
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:57,040
together. So, it makes a difference. And

1321
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,320
Fler and and Orpin, they they proved

1322
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:00,320
that it makes a difference. So, they

1323
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:02,400
proved some bounds for that thing that

1324
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:04,800
are strictly bigger than this thing. But

1325
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:08,800
it took a while to figure out what is

1326
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:11,920
the sharpest bound. Um and that was

1327
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:16,800
figured out sometime later in a paper of

1328
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:21,120
six authors. Um Shang Wang Gan Shia Guo

1329
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:23,920
me Terrence Harris Dominique Mald and

1330
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:27,280
Hang Wa many of whom were here working

1331
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:31,440
on it at various times. Okay. And we

1332
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:40,560
approved um I'll just do a special case.

1333
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:45,120
So if uh x and b3 is a delta 2c set

1334
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:49,360
um and gamma is non- degenerate like

1335
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:53,679
this example above then the average

1336
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:56,880
theta in gamma of pi theta of x delta

1337
01:13:53,679 --> 01:14:00,880
covering number is bigger than cepsilon

1338
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,880
delta to the -2 plus epsilon

1339
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,840
Okay. And the best thing you could hope

1340
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:10,000
for here is delta to the minus2 because

1341
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:14,159
x itself probably has delta covering

1342
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:16,239
number delta to the minus 2. So up to

1343
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:19,239
small issues that this is the sharp

1344
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:19,239
theorem.

1345
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:25,199
Okay. Um this proof is based on some

1346
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:27,040
version of the fora analysis method. Uh

1347
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:30,320
but it's a more difficult version that

1348
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,320
involves decoupling.

1349
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:48,159
Okay,

1350
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:50,800
cool. So this connection between

1351
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:52,480
projection theory and uh between

1352
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,040
homogeneous dynamics and projection

1353
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:57,199
theory was discovered by Alan Linden

1354
01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:00,640
Strauss and Amir Mohammadi who were

1355
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:03,679
working on uh quantitative estimates for

1356
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:06,400
how how unipotent orbits become dense in

1357
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:08,320
this setup and they realized this

1358
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:10,159
connection with projection theory and

1359
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:12,640
they found the literature they found the

1360
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:14,880
paper by Fler and Orpin and and all the

1361
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,440
follow-up papers and they used those

1362
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:20,960
tools to prove of quantitative estimates

1363
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:21,840
about how these unipotent orbits mix.

1364
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,440
>> Yeah.

1365
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,679
>> The question of projection theory where

1366
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,080
kind of each unipotent filament kind of

1367
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:30,560
reduces a different projection. Is that

1368
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:32,800
set of projections dense in kind of the

1369
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,239
whole space of projections or is it some

1370
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:36,640
non-dense subset?

1371
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:39,440
>> No, it's some non-dense subset. Yeah. So

1372
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:41,280
here t is going from zero to one. For

1373
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:45,520
each t we have more or less a

1374
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:49,360
projection. Um and so we have a smooth

1375
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:51,679
curve of length length one in the space

1376
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:54,080
of pro of not exactly projections but

1377
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:56,800
the space of linear maps.

1378
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,320
Um and so it it is not in any sense

1379
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,880
becoming dense in the space of linear

1380
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:04,239
maps. is really just a few special ones.

1381
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:06,320
And um and this is a a reasonable model

1382
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:08,239
to picture in your mind like that that

1383
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,640
sphere is like all of the projections or

1384
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:13,360
all of the linear maps and that orange

1385
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:16,080
circle is the ones that come up in the

1386
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:19,920
in homogeneous dynamics.

1387
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:21,760
Yeah. Okay. So in the last two minutes I

1388
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,760
will write down a theorem that they

1389
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,760
proved.

1390
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:48,159
uh at least approximately.

1391
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:52,560
Okay. So this is Linton Strauss,

1392
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:57,280
Mahmadi, Wang and Yang.

1393
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:59,679
Um so setup is on that board. So if G is

1394
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:03,040
SL3R,

1395
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:08,080
gamma is S L

1396
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:15,440
3 Z U as above.

1397
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:18,800
Okay, we take X um and we suppose U dox

1398
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:23,920
is not close

1399
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,920
to a proper homogeneous subspace.

1400
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:30,320
So it's some analog of being not close

1401
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:35,679
to periodic.

1402
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:44,320
Okay. Then the conclusion is that

1403
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:47,600
u 0t of x is delta dense

1404
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:49,040
in um in the homogeneous space. But so

1405
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:50,800
the homogeneous space has infinite

1406
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:53,920
diameter. So this can't quite be true.

1407
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,920
But in the if you cut off the cusp.

1408
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:01,840
So you cut off the cusp. So you have a

1409
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:04,800
compact piece of this. Um and delta is t

1410
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:08,280
to the minus c. C greater than zero is a

1411
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,280
universal constant.

1412
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:16,480
Okay. And a key step in the proof is to

1413
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,600
first show an estimate of the kind that

1414
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:22,080
we were talking about that the delta

1415
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:25,400
covering number of this orbit is is

1416
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:25,400
pretty big.

1417
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:31,679
Right? So the biggest it could possibly

1418
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,199
be would be delta to minus the dimension

1419
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,520
of the group. That's the delta covering

1420
01:18:33,199 --> 01:18:37,840
number of the whole space. And it's

1421
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,600
quite close to that. That's a key step.

1422
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:43,440
It's analogous to the proof that we

1423
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:45,360
sketched for the simpler SL2R case. Um,

1424
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:47,600
and there is an additional argument, but

1425
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:50,239
it seems like the most novel and

1426
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:53,040
important part of of this paper was

1427
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:54,800
using projection theory, using those

1428
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:57,840
kind of theorems

1429
01:18:54,800 --> 01:19:03,080
plus some other smart stuff uh to show

1430
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:03,080
that the orbit covers a lot of ground.

1431
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:09,920
Okay. Um Okay. So homogeneous dynamics

1432
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,920
is a big subject and there are different

1433
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:13,520
techniques but in this course I wanted

1434
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:15,120
to show that there's a connection to

1435
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:17,600
projection theory which is one set of

1436
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:20,320
techniques and which helps to say some

1437
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,320
some interesting
