1
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,160
So,

2
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,599
choose

3
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,559
12

4
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,559
and options.

5
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,120
So if you have um

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,199
so how do we go about choosing okay

7
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,600
things from 10 objects? That's an easy

8
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,600
way to do it.

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Choose them one at a time. So

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,680
N ways

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,680
to

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,680
first

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,840
because once you choose the first thing

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,400
you can't choose again

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,400
and two

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,040
third

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,040
actually k.

18
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,840
So this gives us

19
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,159
n

20
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,680
- 2

21
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:08,160
n - k + 1. So I guess this should be

22
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,039
plus.

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,039
So is this correct?

24
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,080
No. Why not?

25
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,280
>> Yeah.

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,640
>> You want to like divide their order?

27
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,640
>> Yeah. It's basically because

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,120
we've

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,680
you know we've over counted. I mean if

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,080
you had a set of one two three four five

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,879
we could choose three and four we could

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,040
also choose four and three and these two

33
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,640
ways will give us the same set. So what

34
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,599
we need to do is we need to divide by

35
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,959
the number of ways of getting each of

36
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,840
these objects and that's k factorial

37
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:55,160
because we could have gotten them in any

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,160
order. So we divide by m.

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,360
So this is m k is equal to

40
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,360
now there's another expression for this

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,280
which

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,120
is actually

43
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,920
maybe a little simpler certainly a

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,920
little bit more. We can multiply the top

45
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,319
and we see that this is equal to

46
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,400
now

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,200
one of the

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,120
really nice techniques in proving I

49
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,120
guess theorems about binomial

50
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,799
coefficients and other counting things

51
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,280
is to count things in two different

52
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:02,000
ways. Count the same set of things in

53
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,799
two different ways. These two um

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,879
expressions have to be the same.

55
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,879
So what can we do? Well,

56
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,000
let's

57
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,000
let's count um

58
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,280
ways.

59
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,919
Okay, things.

60
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,840
Well,

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:38,360
either the last thing

62
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,360
is in the set or it's not in the set.

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,360
If it's in the set,

64
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,360
we have

65
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,840
in the set. We have n minus one things

66
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,080
here and the last things in the set. And

67
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,080
then also

68
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,960
um I guess k minus one things

69
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,560
and the first n minus one things in the

70
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,479
set. And if the last thing is not in the

71
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,120
set,

72
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:14,840
then we'll color it white rather than

73
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,840
blue. And you get things in the set.

74
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,039
So um

75
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,120
so what's the number of ways of choosing

76
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,000
k minus one things out of n minus one

77
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,600
things?

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,639
>> Yeah.

79
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,840
choose.

80
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:40,960
>> Yeah, exactly. So, we get n -1 k here

81
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,680
and we get n

82
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,560
choose k way of choosing these things

83
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,600
here. So, that shows us that

84
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,880
n choose k=

85
00:05:51,600 --> 00:06:00,440
n -1 choose k

86
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,440
- 1 + n - k

87
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,639
So

88
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,400
see, so we got this expression by

89
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,600
counting

90
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,919
the number of ways of choosing

91
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,800
K things out of n in two different ways.

92
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,240
First we uh

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,639
colored one of them and then

94
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,880
did the

95
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,319
you know used induction and the other

96
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,319
way is we just

97
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,280
prove the binomial coefficient and

98
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,479
choose 10. So having things in two

99
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:42,240
different ways can give you a theorem

100
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,560
and um in fact it can give you very deep

101
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,759
theorems which

102
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,720
as well as

103
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,720
relatively easy theorems

104
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,960
and

105
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,039
you know there's this beautiful proof of

106
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,639
Kayle's tree theorem and then don't

107
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,440
which depends on counting things in two

108
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,639
different ways and I will eventually get

109
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,560
to it. Probably not until next class.

110
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,599
So,

111
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,599
what do I want to say now?

112
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,759
Yeah,

113
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,759
this is

114
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:33,440
um this formula gives us Pascal's

115
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:37,240
triangle near um

116
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,240
I'm going to say 1

117
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,880
and

118
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:53,080
you know if this

119
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,080
row is n.

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:05,280
So n = 1,

121
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:07,199
n= 0, n = 1, n = 2, etc. And this is k =

122
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,919
0,

123
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,800
k = 1,

124
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,800
k = 2.

125
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,639
Well,

126
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,840
you get this number from adding the two

127
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,160
numbers above it and that follows from

128
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,400
this identity.

129
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,240
And from Pascal's triangle you can see

130
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,240
that n choose kus

131
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:41,200
k because pascal's triangle is

132
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,120
symmetric.

133
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,120
You know the ways of getting this number

134
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,480
is exactly the same. The ways of

135
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,080
computing this number is exactly the

136
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,279
same way

137
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,760
we comput this number because each

138
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,920
row is a

139
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,720
Hello.

140
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,680
But you can also see this by the formula

141
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,200
n factorial k

142
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,200
n minus k factorial.

143
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,240
Okay. So,

144
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:49,760
if a + b c = 10, n choose a b c

145
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,760
is equal to

146
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,760
And

147
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,399
this is the number of ways.

148
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:05,360
Number of ways

149
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,360
of

150
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,360
choosing

151
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,360
a set of size

152
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:21,800
sets of size

153
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,800
sets of size. A B Crow

154
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,480
and X

155
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:36,560
and these sets are labeled and but

156
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:42,240
the things within the sets are um

157
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:44,079
I mean things within the sets are

158
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,079
interchangeable.

159
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,079
So,

160
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,839
and how do you prove this? Well, there's

161
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,320
two ways of proving this. First, you can

162
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,279
um

163
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,279
use this

164
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,279
to

165
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,279
n

166
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,279
c

167
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,279
n - one choose a b - c

168
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,480
a c.

169
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,440
So that's one way to prove it

170
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,959
because you just ask which set was the

171
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,279
last n and then the n minus one

172
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,839
remaining things.

173
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:46,200
you know what the sizes of the sets are

174
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,200
or you can prove it

175
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,399
and

176
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,600
sorry

177
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,800
n=

178
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,079
n choose a

179
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,639
* n a b + b.

180
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,040
So here you first choose the set first

181
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,880
set which has size a and now you choose

182
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,320
the second set for the remaining n minus

183
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:21,200
one a minus things and that has size b

184
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,279
and this is equal to

185
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,279
the

186
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,279
coefficient

187
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,399
n factorial a factorial nusal

188
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,560
times

189
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,560
I guess

190
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,600
n minus a is b + c. So b + c

191
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,480
over

192
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,600
factorial c.

193
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,240
And now remember that b + c plus n minus

194
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:59,760
a. So these two terms cancel and you get

195
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,240
n factorial a factorial bal.

196
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,000
And of course, there's no reason that

197
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:10,360
you

198
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,360
would need to stop with three sets.

199
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,760
We get noose

200
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:22,480
a1 a2 through a k

201
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:27,399
is equal to n factorial over the product

202
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,399
1 through k a sub

203
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,920
a1 + a2

204
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,920
plus a k.

205
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,440
So this is um multial coefficients.

206
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,480
So now I want to talk about bjections

207
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,079
which is another way of counting things

208
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,600
and

209
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:27,199
um you know common and tourists really

210
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,519
like finding bjective proofs by

211
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,519
although So

212
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,279
these are not necessarily the easiest

213
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:40,760
groups.

214
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,760
So um but often they are bjection

215
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,920
function

216
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,680
is bjection

217
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,760
is injective and surjective.

218
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,240
I guess a B or A sets of things

219
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,920
means A1

220
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:31,279
is not equal to F A2

221
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,079
A1 is not equal to A2.

222
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,720
So you don't get that mapping two things

223
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,720
onto the same

224
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,880
object

225
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,880
and subjective

226
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:54,519
is if B is on B

227
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,519
then there exists an A.

228
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:04,279
So subjective means that everything in B

229
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,279
is in the range of

230
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,680
also

231
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,680
f is

232
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,600
um

233
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,320
only

234
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,320
F as an inverse

235
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:38,360
f. Now for inverse we use f of g of a

236
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,440
g of f of b.

237
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,839
I guess I will prove one of these

238
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,839
directions.

239
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,199
F has an inverse.

240
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,880
It is a function.

241
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,320
So what we need to prove is that it's

242
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,320
injective and it's surgic.

243
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,360
half of A1

244
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,360
= half of A2.

245
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:06,440
G of half of A1 = G of A2

246
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:15,200
just because G is a function. But this

247
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,640
has to a2 and this has to equal a1.

248
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,280
So this implies

249
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,559
a1.

250
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,559
So f is

251
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,640
injective.

252
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,919
E is in the range of

253
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,840
f of g of pals.

254
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,720
So there's this element that maps to b.

255
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,720
So it's subjective.

256
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:01,240
And we've proven that f has an inverse

257
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,240
that has a bjection.

258
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,720
And a nice thing about bjections is that

259
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,799
the size of a is

260
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:31,280
and so if we counted the things in A

261
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:34,640
then we will also have counted things B

262
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,039
and we'll see seeing several examples of

263
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,799
this today. And the first one I want to

264
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,960
show you

265
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:45,960
is another thing with bal

266
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,960
coefficients.

267
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,000
Um let's see.

268
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:10,039
Oh, many

269
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,039
different ways.

270
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,160
Oh, coloring.

271
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,440
Okay.

272
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,840
and balls with J

273
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,440
and I should tell you what I mean

274
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,440
different here. So

275
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,559
um

276
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,520
so let's do an example

277
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,480
n= 4

278
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,840
and

279
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,840
J.

280
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,039
Well, we could color them all the same

281
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,039
color.

282
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,960
I want to claim that there's only one

283
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,720
way of doing that.

284
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,280
for each color. If there's only one way

285
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,280
of doing that, so there are three ways

286
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,280
TO

287
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:27,919
color one of them one color

288
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,919
and the other

289
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,919
three

290
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,159
um

291
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,240
one of them one color and the other

292
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:50,240
three another color.

293
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,640
And I want to claim there are three ways

294
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,520
of doing this because or six ways of

295
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,640
doing this because you choose one color

296
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,440
for the first one and

297
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,000
three colors for the other one. So there

298
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,159
are three ways to choose the first color

299
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,799
and two ways to choose the second color.

300
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,799
So there are six ways.

301
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,679
So note that we're not distinguishing

302
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,919
the coloring red blue from the color

303
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,280
blue red blue.

304
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:24,400
So these we're just asking for the total

305
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:29,600
number of balls we colored. And you

306
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:33,360
could also color two of them one color

307
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,880
and two of them another color.

308
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,120
And I want to claim there are three ways

309
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,360
of doing this

310
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,360
because there are three colors you don't

311
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,000
use. And once you've decided which color

312
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,720
you're not going to use, the rest of

313
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,720
them are

314
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,080
given. So that's 12 so far.

315
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,919
And I'm

316
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,919
Is there another color? Another way I

317
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,919
missed?

318
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:07,200
Yeah, like 211. Yeah, 211.

319
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,280
Okay, so we could have

320
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,280
red,

321
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,280
blue,

322
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,880
green, green. So, how many ways are

323
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,880
there doing this?

324
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,120
Yeah,

325
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,640
>> there are three ways to just choose

326
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,159
which color.

327
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:35,320
>> Yeah, there are three ways because once

328
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,320
you've chosen which color you're going

329
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,880
make two balls then the rest is set. So

330
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:46,880
there are three

331
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:51,280
and if we up we get 15

332
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,360
and 15 just happens to be equal to

333
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,320
5

334
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,000
choose 2.

335
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,520
And

336
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,080
you know just from this one example it

337
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,679
might be a coincidence but you can try a

338
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,600
whole bunch of other examples and it

339
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,480
always works out to be a binomial

340
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,520
coefficient. So it turned out not to be

341
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,679
a coincidence and a theorem that would

342
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,760
like to prove

343
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,240
and

344
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,760
find two is a number of ways of choosing

345
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,960
two things out of five things. So, how

346
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,880
can we take

347
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,120
these colorings of balls and turn it

348
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,279
into

349
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,520
finding a subset of two things out of

350
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,520
five things?

351
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,640
And

352
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,440
this is actually a fairly clever

353
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,840
digestion. I'm not going to ask you to

354
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,840
figure it out.

355
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,400
You'll notice I'm going to do this all.

356
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,279
So, let's um

357
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,960
pick one of these. Um okay, we should

358
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,960
pick two of them.

359
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,880
green.

360
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,640
So first step

361
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,799
step

362
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,799
order balls

363
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:51,400
with some fixed ordering and in this

364
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,400
case it'll be red green.

365
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,600
Okay. Second step

366
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,000
is insert the

367
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,520
So we're going to put a divider between

368
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:18,799
actually you know what would have caught

369
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:23,440
my mistake

370
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:29,600
15 is 6 choose 2 and not 5 choose two.

371
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:32,640
So because it's 6 * 5 / 2 that's 15. 5

372
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,640
choose 2 is 10.

373
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,000
So I should warn you that I cannot do

374
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:43,200
elementary arithmetic when I'm

375
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,320
so um

376
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,520
so the second step is insert dividers.

377
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,240
So what we're going to do is we're going

378
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,240
to take this

379
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,000
and dividers between the

380
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:11,080
So

381
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,080
okay now I want to claim the third step

382
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,559
is the base.

383
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:33,320
Okay. So now we have two dividers

384
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,120
and six

385
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:46,919
things

386
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,919
because we had four balls and two bers.

387
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:54,159
Okay.

388
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,640
And I want to claim that this is a

389
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,440
righteous. Why?

390
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,919
because we can reverse it. If we know

391
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,440
where the divisors are, what we do is we

392
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,640
color everything before the first

393
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,240
divider red, everything between the

394
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,480
first second divider blue, and

395
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,480
everything after the second divider

396
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,559
green. And if we don't have any red

397
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,720
balls, we just put the first divider at

398
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,520
the beginning.

399
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:27,039
So, um, this can be reversed and this

400
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:31,919
can be reversed. So that means if this

401
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:35,919
function that maps from colored balls to

402
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:38,240
balls and dividers is

403
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,279
reversal is invertible.

404
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,279
So that means that it's a bjection.

405
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,279
Okay.

406
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,440
Okay. So that means that the number of

407
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,600
Maybe I

408
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,679
Good morning.

409
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Um

410
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,240
involves the jars.

411
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,720
So how many dividers do you use

412
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,720
that we have J colors? How many dividers

413
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,720
this?

414
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,559
>> Yeah.

415
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,720
>> J minus one. J minus one because we put

416
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:59,520
the fire between

417
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:02,559
all the pairs of colors and we have N +

418
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,679
J minus one

419
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:10,279
things. These are the total dividers of

420
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,279
the colors and we're choosing Jers.

421
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,679
Okay, so that was a really

422
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:40,200
and so this shows proofs djection and

423
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,200
this is not a completely real

424
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,240
and I want to claim that there are other

425
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,559
ways you could do it.

426
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,559
done this.

427
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,559
Okay.

428
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:09,320
So now I want to shift gears and talk

429
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,320
about thick walls which are

430
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,880
capital which are

431
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,279
really very nice um

432
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,960
very nice example and we will see them

433
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,960
again when we do.

434
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,159
Okay.

435
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,919
First, let's

436
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,080
And so

437
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,039
is up

438
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,919
49 0

439
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,519
2 2n

440
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,279
z

441
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,600
and I guess I should call that a path of

442
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,600
length 2n

443
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,240
and each step

444
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:40,480
is

445
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:42,399
- one sorry each step is 1us

446
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,919
one

447
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:47,480
and

448
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,480
it's always

449
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,640
above

450
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,640
X axis

451
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,600
and that's

452
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,600
and for the

453
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,600
numbers

454
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,279
length

455
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:13,760
2 N

456
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:18,519
is C subn

457
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,519
the and Cadillac.

458
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,320
Okay.

459
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,600
So

460
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,679
for Yes.

461
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,200
>> So the first step is not legal to have

462
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,159
like oneus.

463
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,640
>> The first step always goes up. Yes. And

464
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,600
the last step always goes down because

465
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:54,240
it has to come back to zero. And if you

466
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:58,960
have a big path, the reverse is also

467
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:02,159
what I'm going to do is I'm going to um

468
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,600
give you some examples.

469
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:09,200
C1 is equal to

470
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,359
Well, how many paths are there?

471
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,359
The first step has to go up and the

472
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:17,760
second step has to go down. So

473
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,639
is what?

474
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,200
Now let's figure out

475
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:31,079
two. Well, you could either go up down

476
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:31,079
up down or you could go up up down.

477
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:40,440
So C2 = 2, C3 = 5. And let's um

478
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:53,919
Okay, so we have that one. We could use

479
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:55,440
this one. So we go up twice. Twice

480
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:59,119
and

481
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,119
one more. And we could do the same

482
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,119
thing.

483
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:11,079
And

484
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,079
We could also go up three

485
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:26,040
and there's one I'm missing.

486
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,040
Anyone want to tell me what it is?

487
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:41,880
>> Yeah. Up, down, up, down, down.

488
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,880
>> Yeah, there we go.

489
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:52,359
Down up down.

490
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,359
So number five

491
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,560
or like six, I should say.

492
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,680
Okay, I did not write these

493
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:40,599
Okay. And let's

494
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,599
numbers down here. Catalan numbers.

495
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,880
One 2

496
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,960
um

497
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,520
14

498
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,400
42

499
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,400
132

500
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,040
And we do not have to memorize this.

501
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,320
Maybe you should memorize. I mean, we're

502
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,599
going to be doing a lot of stuff with

503
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,280
Cadillac number. So, maybe you should

504
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,280
memorize the first three or four in the

505
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,280
series.

506
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,320
Okay.

507
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,560
So, Richard Stanley was a professor at

508
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,119
MIT before he retired. He was a

509
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,880
cominator tourist and he came up with

510
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,200
something like 200 things that are

511
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,200
counted by the capitalist.

512
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:37,440
So there are really a lot of I mean they

513
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,359
really appear all over mathematics

514
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,119
and um

515
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,240
>> is there a pattern relating them to the

516
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,400
end?

517
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,400
>> Yes, there is and we will get to that

518
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,079
eventually.

519
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,680
But the first thing I want to do is tell

520
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,680
you two more things that are counted by.

521
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,040
Okay.

522
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,720
So there are plain trees

523
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,839
and

524
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,839
n

525
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,800
groups

526
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:43,839
n= 1 have a tree

527
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,119
Only one way you can draw a tree really

528
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,119
and two

529
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,119
draws.

530
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,920
So that's one, two, just like that.

531
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,599
And

532
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,000
let's

533
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:08,200
draw a tree. This

534
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,200
tree looks like this.

535
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,440
looks like this.

536
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:21,079
We draw a tree just like this.

537
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,079
And there's one

538
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,800
there.

539
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,800
And you'll notice that

540
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,760
these um

541
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:40,079
left and right count when you're talking

542
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,920
about. So this is the mirror image of

543
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,599
this but they count as two different

544
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,599
trees.

545
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,599
So

546
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:52,000
which

547
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,680
leaf

548
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,680
or which vertex something is attached to

549
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,680
matters.

550
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,079
And the next one has 14 but we're not

551
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,079
going to draw that.

552
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,119
And

553
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,400
Oh, let's let's do it up here.

554
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:03,079
I don't know what to say. Last thing

555
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,079
were

556
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,160
every node

557
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,680
two.

558
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,680
So,

559
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,119
so n=

560
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:31,400
one binary tree

561
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,400
on I guess three bird seeds, two leaves.

562
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,640
We can either add

563
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,160
two

564
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,079
either develop this node or develop this

565
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,040
node.

566
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:52,359
and three.

567
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,359
Okay. See if I can not

568
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,960
And that is supposed to be all although

569
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,960
it's not immediately clear.

570
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,560
You know, you get one of these by taking

571
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,520
one of these and adding a pair of leaves

572
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,560
to the bricks

573
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,720
and a pair of leaves to a leaf. And

574
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,480
there are only

575
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:52,800
well you could pair to anything here to

576
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:55,520
any vertices but you do it to this

577
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,640
vertex and this vertex you get the same

578
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,119
tree. So this is fine.

579
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,640
>> Yes.

580
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,440
letters.

581
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:08,440
>> N is counting

582
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,440
um

583
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,640
and is number of non

584
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:27,079
less than

585
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,079
weakness.

586
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:47,119
And you can prove that every tree has

587
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:50,480
one more leaf node and

588
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:54,000
interior node because now this is true

589
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,720
for n= one. At n= two, you replace a

590
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,720
leaf with an interior node and two more

591
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:03,200
leaves.

592
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:06,160
So you preserve the number of

593
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,839
leaf nodes minus non leaf nodes.

594
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:12,319
So for binary trees

595
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:16,480
every node

596
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:20,359
the number of non is one

597
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,359
fewer than the number of

598
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,960
okay

599
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,640
number of edges or n is the number of

600
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,640
edges. Yeah.

601
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,640
And there's one equals number.

602
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,480
Oh no, a number of vertices.

603
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,079
And you can similarly prove that a tree

604
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:04,000
always has one more

605
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,000
vertex than action.

606
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,520
Okay.

607
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:15,680
So we have three things which counted by

608
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,760
they pass and I think what I'm going to

609
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:24,200
do is first I'm going to give you the

610
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:24,200
formula for the catal number

611
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,800
and this is a

612
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,800
really nice

613
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,359
well

614
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,680
this is a really nice proof of the

615
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,000
formula for capital number although it's

616
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,000
a little bit complicated

617
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
and

618
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,520
we will

619
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,319
this is one of those proofs that

620
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:11,480
it's not clearly help anyone come up

621
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,480
with it.

622
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:18,280
So

623
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,280
C is equal to

624
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,640
1

625
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,640
+

626
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,640
2.

627
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:34,440
So that's the formula for the numbers.

628
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,440
So let's try it for n= 3.

629
00:46:50,560 --> 00:47:00,440
So that's 6 choose 3 * 1 4

630
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,440
6

631
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:09,440
1 and actually there's four

632
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:12,960
And we're going to cancel these out. The

633
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:16,520
fours cancel, threes cancel the two and

634
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,520
we get five.

635
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:25,280
So it works at least for one case in

636
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:29,400
that we'll prove it in general.

637
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,400
So how are we going to prove it?

638
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,599
Okay, let

639
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,400
zero

640
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,400
be the number of PS

641
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,200
0.

642
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,040
So this is all paths from

643
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,520
0 0

644
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,520
to 2 Z.

645
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,960
Okay.

646
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,800
E

647
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,800
false.

648
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:37,400
And let's go R

649
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,400
Pus.

650
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,480
So everything that's notable.

651
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,119
And what we're going to do is we will

652
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:55,359
count

653
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:58,359
the number of things in the end.

654
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,359
All right.

655
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,400
And now

656
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:06,559
to get the number of dick walls, we just

657
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,119
take the number of paths and subtract

658
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,960
the bar and we get to the end. So can

659
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:15,640
someone tell me what the number of paths

660
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,640
is from 0 0 to 20?

661
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,440
Yeah.

662
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:33,040
>> 2 n because we need n

663
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:36,319
steps up and n steps down and we don't

664
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,559
care whether it goes below the x-axis or

665
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:43,319
not.

666
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,319
Okay. So, what is dx?

667
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,760
Well,

668
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,760
let

669
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:12,960
B - 2

670
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:15,440
N

671
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,440
B

672
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,240
from

673
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,400
0 0 to 2 n - 2

674
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:34,440
and we don't care which way they go.

675
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,680
So

676
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:44,480
you should

677
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:48,079
So a path from 2n from 0 0 to 2 n minus

678
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:52,440
2 is going to have to have one two more

679
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,440
down steps in upstal.

680
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:11,160
And I'm going to claim that the number

681
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,160
of non paths

682
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:17,880
is equal to the number of

683
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,760
02

684
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,720
and that will give us the catal when we

685
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,880
subtract.

686
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:36,200
I show you that first.

687
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,200
That's pretty.

688
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,680
So, a path from

689
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:08,839
P nus 2 is equal to 2 to n - 1.

690
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:08,839
P subn 0 + 2 ch

691
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:22,559
- 2

692
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,559
is 2 n factorial over n factorial n

693
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:30,720
factorial

694
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:32,960
- 2 n factorial over n + 1 factorial

695
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,960
n

696
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:41,280
is equal to

697
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:44,880
well this is just 2n choose n and this

698
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,400
if we take 2 n choose n and multiply in

699
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,200
the

700
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,119
denominator by n + one and the numerator

701
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,440
by n

702
00:52:51,119 --> 00:53:01,720
we get

703
00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:01,720
this thing that's minus n / n + one

704
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:14,319
that you see when we multiply by

705
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,720
n + 1

706
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:19,520
n in the numerator

707
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:24,319
will turn n factorial the denominator

708
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:27,599
one factorial when we n + one in the

709
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:28,880
denominator turns an n factorial

710
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:33,720
factorial

711
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,720
So to get from here to here, we multip

712
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:38,359
and this is just equal to

713
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,680
10 / n +.

714
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,680
So what we have to do now is show that

715
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:57,680
every nondict path show a djection

716
00:53:51,680 --> 00:54:00,559
between non path and paths from 2

717
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:04,839
to

718
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,839
from 0 to 2.

719
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:20,760
And this I think the best way of doing

720
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,760
it is um

721
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,400
best way

722
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,599
is by drawing a picture.

723
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:38,119
I'm not going to be able to describe it

724
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,119
in words.

725
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:47,280
Okay.

726
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:51,680
So we have here

727
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:56,319
and it goes starts at zero

728
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:58,400
and it goes up down down up down maybe

729
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:00,640
at some point it has to go below the

730
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:05,640
x-axis because it has to end up at minus

731
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,640
two and um

732
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,680
which is why it's not

733
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,280
this I believe is minus two.

734
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,480
Okay.

735
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:27,480
So this is a

736
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:43,520
I guess we are six

737
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,839
any difference.

738
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:49,359
Okay. What are we going to do? What

739
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:52,359
we're going to do is we're going to take

740
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,359
the

741
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,680
x =

742
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:04,400
x.

743
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:07,400
I'm going to reflect this path around

744
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,400
x=us1

745
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,520
from every point after the first time it

746
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,520
hits minus one

747
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:27,400
from

748
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,400
let's say

749
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,040
x -

750
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,720
I guess

751
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:45,000
x= -

752
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:57,040
well

753
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:59,920
it's going to end up on zero

754
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,920
and

755
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:14,480
Okay. So now I would claim this is a

756
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:19,599
nondict path.

757
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:24,240
So why is it a nondict path? Well,

758
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:27,680
I mean we have a point x that is x=us

759
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:31,280
one. So it has to be a nonic path.

760
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:33,280
because it goes below the x-axis

761
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:38,240
and

762
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:40,720
it is a path from zero to to n every

763
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:46,240
step up

764
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:49,960
either up or down. So it is in

765
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,960
p 0

766
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,599
and I'm going to claim this is a

767
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:57,760
bjection between two paths

768
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:01,079
and

769
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,079
Stro Zus.

770
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:25,760
Now why is that?

771
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:28,960
Right? And if you have a path from here,

772
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,640
well, you have a path from

773
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,000
0

774
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:38,160
to n minus 2, you take this point, which

775
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:41,920
is the first point that hits

776
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:44,480
you around this axis and you get a

777
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,119
unique path. On the other hand, if you

778
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:52,799
have a path

779
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:55,280
from x= 0 to x = 2n that goes below the

780
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:57,280
x ais, you can take the first time it

781
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:01,760
has

782
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:04,400
the x= -1 line and you've undone this

783
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:07,359
function.

784
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,079
So it's a function f which has an

785
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:13,240
inverse ga

786
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,240
by junction.

787
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:24,040
Okay. And the number of paths from x=

788
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,040
0us

789
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:28,200
2 indeed

790
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,799
factorial. So this shows that the number

791
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:39,359
of nonps

792
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:45,880
is the right number. So that shows the

793
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:45,880
number of big pads number. So that's our

794
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:53,880
that's our proof that big pads are

795
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,880
number.

796
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,640
So

797
00:59:56,319 --> 01:00:00,480
I want to say how would you ever find

798
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:03,680
this proof?

799
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:06,680
I really don't know.

800
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,680
However,

801
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,280
if you wait a couple weeks, we will be

802
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,680
doing generating functions. And

803
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,720
generating functions is a completely

804
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:18,799
straightforward way of figuring out the

805
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,119
formula for the

806
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:24,319
although it's

807
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:28,040
actually not as nice and easy as this.

808
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:28,040
It involves some calculations.

809
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,880
Okay.

810
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:40,480
And now the next thing I want to show is

811
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:43,799
a djection between binary trees and

812
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,799
thick paths.

813
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:55,240
And that will show you that

814
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:55,240
binary trees are also counted by

815
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:41,880
Okay. So, how does this work? Well,

816
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,880
let's do an example. So,

817
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:06,359
Okay. So this is a LIBRARY

818
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,520
and what we're going to do is we're

819
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:16,920
going to traverse the nodes in that

820
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,920
first order.

821
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,559
And what does that mean? Well,

822
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:38,559
What it means in this case is we're

823
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:42,559
going to just run around the outside

824
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:48,400
and the first visit. This one is the

825
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:51,920
second we visit. This is the third we

826
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,920
go down up and we visit. So we're only

827
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:57,920
counting the first time we visit this

828
01:02:53,920 --> 01:03:01,200
node. This is five six.

829
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:03,280
Okay. Now we go down back down and up

830
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:08,280
here. This is the seventh note, eighth

831
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,280
node, ninth node, 10th node.

832
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:15,960
Okay.

833
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,960
So what do we do with these things?

834
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:32,559
What we're going to do is we're going to

835
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:36,200
associate

836
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,200
each of the nose

837
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:42,760
um

838
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,760
INTERIOR

839
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:51,880
call plus and

840
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:51,880
we will call.

841
01:03:52,960 --> 01:04:05,280
So what is this? This is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

842
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:09,119
9 10 11

843
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:11,280
and one and two are both pluses

844
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:16,240
because they're internal notes. Three is

845
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:20,799
a minus. Four is a plus.

846
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:24,799
Five is a minus and six is a minus.

847
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:29,480
Seven is a plus. 8 is a minus.

848
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:29,480
9 is a plus. 10 and 11 are minus.

849
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:33,319
Okay.

850
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:42,079
And what we do is we use this path. We

851
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:45,079
go up with plus and down when it's a

852
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,079
minus.

853
01:04:56,079 --> 01:05:03,079
So what does our path look like? Well,

854
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:03,079
it starts out twice.

855
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:11,280
And now we go down and up and down and

856
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:15,160
down.

857
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:15,160
And we go up.

858
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:25,000
- plus - plus

859
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
-

860
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:36,240
one more interior

861
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:39,559
one more loop interior. So this always

862
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,559
ends up

863
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:53,839
but the last step has to be a leaf. So

864
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:55,920
the last has to be down. So we just

865
01:05:53,839 --> 01:06:01,880
ignore this

866
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:01,880
last step. and the path is here.

867
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:13,319
So we have to prove this is a d path and

868
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:13,319
we also have to prove that

869
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:19,160
every path corresponds to

870
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,400
Okay.

871
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:45,880
So why is this?

872
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,880
Well,

873
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:58,440
how many upsteps does it have and how

874
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,440
many down steps does it have?

875
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:09,520
So, there are 2 n + one

876
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:12,640
leaves. All right. N plus one leaves and

877
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:15,920
n interior nodes.

878
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:18,079
But we're ignoring the last step. So

879
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:22,680
there are n

880
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:22,680
steps up and n steps down.

881
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:37,200
And why does it never go

882
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:41,720
the x axis?

883
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,720
>> So suppose it went below the xaxis.

884
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:17,319
Look

885
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:17,319
at

886
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,480
the tree.

887
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:26,759
and

888
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:26,759
and just

889
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:38,440
well just the nodes up to the point

890
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:38,440
where it goes to minus one.

891
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:46,920
I guess 2 k.

892
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,920
Well,

893
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:03,880
this sub

894
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,880
must have.

895
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:09,000
Oh, one more

896
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:17,000
leaf

897
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:17,000
then interior.

898
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:26,359
Okay. So, it has one more leaf and

899
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,359
interior node.

900
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:42,040
It's a full binary TREE

901
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,279
because you know basically if you take a

902
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:53,359
tree

903
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,920
and you remove

904
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:59,600
some part of it

905
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,600
before um let's stop when I get to this

906
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:03,040
thing

907
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,960
some part of

908
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:08,640
Then

909
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:11,280
I want to claim this part always has at

910
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:14,640
least

911
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:18,840
as many leaves as interpret.

912
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:18,840
Why? Wow.

913
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,440
If you remove some part of it, there's

914
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:37,920
always

915
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:41,360
uh no degree one. It's because if you

916
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:43,199
have every node has degree two, it's a

917
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:46,719
complete binary tree and you can't add

918
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:48,320
anything more to it. So that means that

919
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:50,880
you traverse the whole tree. So there's

920
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:55,960
a

921
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:55,960
node of degree one

922
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,640
and

923
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,640
that

924
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:11,320
well there's either an inter

925
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,440
tree.

926
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:38,080
So if you move if you stop at this note

927
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:41,920
and move these two leaves, you either

928
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:46,280
have this guy

929
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,280
Or you could stop

930
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:52,840
here and this leaf. Then you have

931
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:05,080
this guy which is

932
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:05,080
just has degree one. So

933
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,640
if you um stop early

934
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:16,560
you'll always have

935
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,239
more interior doses than leaves. That

936
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:21,040
leaves and that means you haven't

937
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:23,760
actually got

938
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:26,760
to

939
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,760
yet.

940
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,920
So

941
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:35,239
if you take a tree,

942
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:42,640
if you take a binary tree and you stop

943
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:46,199
really

944
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,199
do not get

945
01:12:51,679 --> 01:13:00,120
that little bit, but you can go and

946
01:12:54,719 --> 01:13:00,120
figure it out if you want. And um

947
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,520
and

948
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:08,159
every

949
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:13,040
will give you a tree because

950
01:13:08,159 --> 01:13:16,320
you know you just go through this and

951
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:22,880
you put a plus one. If it's a plus one

952
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:24,640
two goes on. So minus one leaves on and

953
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:27,760
eventually

954
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,760
you'll get to the

955
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,960
We'll get the tree cut out.

956
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:43,360
Suppose you label this one this

957
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:47,679
one.

958
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:51,440
Well, either this is a plus one

959
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:53,679
or it's a minus one case and you end.

960
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,239
And um

961
01:13:53,679 --> 01:14:00,320
now there's always something to do. I

962
01:13:56,239 --> 01:14:02,880
mean as long as

963
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:05,280
this tree does not have more interior

964
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:08,320
nodes

965
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:10,320
does not have

966
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,320
one more leaf than the interior. You can

967
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:17,360
always add to it and as soon as you get

968
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:19,920
to the end of the path and it has

969
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:21,679
as many

970
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,239
one more interior

971
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:30,080
One more leaf in the interior node, then

972
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:33,080
it's a full binary tree and we're done.

973
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,080
Okay,

974
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:40,560
so that is more or less what I wanted to

975
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:42,800
tell you today. I

976
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:48,040
also wanted to tell you what Sterling's

977
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,040
formula was, but um

978
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:52,080
well, I'll just give it to you.

979
01:14:53,440 --> 01:15:02,679
We can next time. Okay, I have time. So

980
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:02,679
n factorial

981
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:08,600
is equal to

982
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,600
approximately

983
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:17,560
2 m

984
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:17,560
over the

985
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:36,480
And from this you can get 2 n

986
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:39,480
approximately

987
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,480
um<unk>

988
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
4

989
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:49,159
I

990
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,600
squared

991
01:15:54,080 --> 01:16:02,760
2 n / b 2

992
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:02,760
n / b n

993
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:11,040
because we're just taking n factorial.

994
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,960
We're taking this approximation for 2n

995
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:16,560
factorial and dividing it by

996
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:18,080
approximation for n factorial.

997
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:21,440
And you can see that most of these

998
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:24,480
things cancel out.

999
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:27,440
This e cancels the c. This cancels this

1000
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:29,760
time

1001
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:34,360
and

1002
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:34,360
this more or less cancels

1003
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,360
and we get

1004
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:55,320
And that tells us that C7.

1005
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:21,120
Okay, so we have an approximation. We

1006
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:24,120
know roughly how fast C

1007
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,120
goes.

1008
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:33,800
Okay, so next time I will do more

1009
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:33,800
examples of counting.

1010
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,400
Any questions?

1011
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,400
Okay, we're not going to give proof of

1012
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:52,719
Sterling's formula, but I want to say

1013
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:56,960
the only hard part about proof of

1014
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:59,360
Sterling's formula is this square of pi.

1015
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:01,520
Everything else

1016
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:05,120
I guess the square root of 2 pi

1017
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:09,440
everything else is

1018
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:14,600
can be done with elementary calculus or

1019
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:14,600
elementary probability but the root pi

1020
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:21,640
this con is tricky. Okay, thanks
