1
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:17,440
Okay. So last time uh we uh we talked

2
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,199
about

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,199
um in particular we talked about two

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:27,000
things. We talked about the cushy

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,000
uh convergence here.

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,120
So the cushy convergence theorem says

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,120
that any any cushy sequence

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,320
uh is convergent.

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,879
Right? So this is one thing we talked

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,199
quite a bit about last time. uh and we

11
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,079
proved it but we proved it assuming

12
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,079
another theorem. So we showed it the

13
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,079
proof

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,159
proof used

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,280
the also bas

16
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,119
now now

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,119
the person bias theorem. So that's the

18
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,119
following.

19
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,880
So this is the following theorem

20
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,280
that say that any bounded

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,280
any bounded

22
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,439
any bounded

23
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,439
sequence

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,479
A end has a convergent subsequence

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,040
and let's call it a and k. Okay, that

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,120
was the balsano vra theorem. So using

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,760
this remember the cushi convergence

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,400
theorem the proof then went like this

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,599
that if you take a cushi sequence then

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,000
it was easy to prove that it was bounded

31
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:37,120
then you use the balsano vasium to say

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,360
that now the sequence is bounded it's a

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,720
sequence the sequence is bounded so it

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,959
has a convergent subsequence so you have

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,760
and the limit you would then want to

36
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,959
prove that the limit is actually a limit

37
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,000
That's for the whole sequence right

38
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,040
that's what we did right

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,680
now but we didn't prove the balsano vess

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,680
theorem so let's try to pro prove it now

41
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,560
so proof of the bzano vos

42
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,280
so let me try to explain the idea

43
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,280
So you have a sequence a n

44
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,760
and a n is bounded. Let's just say it

45
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,440
doesn't matter but let's say that a n

46
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,319
lie in the interval from 0 to one.

47
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,480
It could be any other bounded interval

48
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:41,200
but but let's just say it's 0 to one.

49
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,760
Then the idea is that you we want to

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,400
prove that a n we want to so the idea is

51
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,959
that we want to find

52
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,959
want to find

53
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,239
um a subsequence

54
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,000
A and K

55
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,000
and two other sequences.

56
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,080
and two other sequences.

57
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:26,639
A sorry B K and C K. And these two other

58
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,720
sequences has a property that if you

59
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:34,960
have here

60
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:38,960
A and K then the B's lie below

61
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,800
the they lie below the A and K and the

62
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,160
C's

63
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,160
lies above it.

64
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,199
So, so the sequence the subsequence

65
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,680
that we will find is going to be

66
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:59,040
squeezed between two other sequences.

67
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:02,360
So, so right. So, a and k

68
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,360
is squeezed

69
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,080
between two other sequences.

70
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,639
And the thing about the other sequences

71
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,680
is that they are much nicer

72
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,840
because so why are they much nicer? The

73
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,479
BKS

74
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,160
are monotum

75
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,440
increasing

76
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,400
and the CK

77
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,400
are monotum decreasing.

78
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,120
Okay.

79
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:46,479
So, so you have that. So the picture is

80
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:48,880
sort of that the that the bees the bees

81
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,479
are always moving in this directions.

82
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,759
The C's here this is the B's they you

83
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:59,280
know as as K get larger they're moving

84
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:03,199
to the right and the C case are moving

85
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,680
to the left and these guys

86
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,720
A and K

87
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,440
they will be squeezed between these two

88
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,600
right? So if you're looking at a later

89
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:20,479
one right h so this is like one and now

90
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,240
imagine that you take a later uh uh in

91
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:27,120
the subsequence

92
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:30,319
sorry let me indicate it here a n say l

93
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,120
and l is now further out in the

94
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:38,240
subsequence

95
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:42,400
then this is going to be lying between b

96
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:46,160
L and CL

97
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,120
but these here this here will lie you

98
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,160
know the B L because it's further out in

99
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,199
subsequence it would lie to the right of

100
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:59,360
the so here will be BK it would be BK

101
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,720
would be to the left and CK would be to

102
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,280
the right of this right so you see that

103
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,720
these here are coming together they're

104
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,400
coming together like this and the the

105
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,400
the a no the the a the subsequent is

106
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,560
going to be squeezed in smaller and

107
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,360
smaller interval right and that's going

108
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,400
to force it to converge right and the

109
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,720
the point here is that because this here

110
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,039
is increasing

111
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,840
and they always lie between the ones

112
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:34,080
that go below this automatically means

113
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,240
that the B case will always be less than

114
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,599
than the first

115
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,160
C

116
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:45,440
and and this C case will always be

117
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,759
bigger than the first

118
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:53,840
uh B and so this is a more a sequence

119
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,879
that go up but it's bounded so it has a

120
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,680
limit so BK

121
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,319
is converging to something

122
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,160
the CKS are going down but they're

123
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,560
bounded from uniformly bounded from

124
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,639
below so they will also be converging

125
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,039
converging,

126
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,120
right? But now they're coming closer

127
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,120
together, right? They're coming closer

128
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,199
and closer together. This is converging

129
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,560
to that and this is converted to this.

130
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,240
So that's going to imply that B is equal

131
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,520
to C.

132
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,520
Okay, that's the idea. Yeah, sorry.

133
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,919
>> They they only they

134
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:36,479
will uh they they will be uh they will

135
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:41,200
have sorry the B

136
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,839
K will be less or equal to B K + one and

137
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:50,880
the C K

138
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:53,360
will uh be uh big or equal to CK + one.

139
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,240
>> So so it's not strict it's like

140
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,240
inequality like this.

141
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,200
>> Yeah that's right. But the thing is also

142
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:08,399
that they are going to that the

143
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:12,320
difference. So the CK is lying above the

144
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,160
BK. Right? So this here is positive.

145
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,720
This is

146
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,440
and we prove that this here is bounded

147
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,320
by two. It was actually going to be

148
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:27,760
equal to we actually prove that this

149
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:31,040
here is equal to um to one minus like

150
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,320
this and you see this here goes to zero.

151
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,880
So you're right that uh if they didn't

152
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,959
come together we couldn't conclude

153
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,279
things but they will come together this

154
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,519
will guarantee. So how do we do this?

155
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,920
That's the idea. How do we do this?

156
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,279
Well,

157
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,600
and again I'm just I'm just doing 0 to

158
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:58,000
one, but it but the same argument work

159
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,160
for any other interval. It's only like

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,279
it will look it will look simpler if I

161
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,360
do it from 0 to one. Uh but it's not

162
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,839
there's nothing essential I'm using

163
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:13,360
about. So here is your starting interval

164
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:16,240
from 0 to one.

165
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,640
We want to construct a subsequence and

166
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,440
we want to not only what do we want to

167
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,480
construct a subsequence but we also want

168
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:32,160
to construct the sequence BK and the

169
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:37,680
sequence CK right so let me find let me

170
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:41,839
define B1 b1 is just going to be zero

171
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:48,640
c1 is going to be one

172
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:51,279
and then uh a n1 that's the subsequence

173
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,959
the first element is subsequence I just

174
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,120
take it to be the first element in

175
00:10:52,959 --> 00:11:01,440
sequence okay so now of course we have

176
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,959
trivially that we have that b1 which is

177
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,000
zero

178
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,720
this is lesser equal to a1 because it

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,120
lie in this interval lesser or equal to

180
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:17,200
c1 which is one Okay.

181
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,880
Now then you divide it into two

182
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:25,120
intervals here. So the second step is

183
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,519
that you take the interval from 0 to

184
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,680
one.

185
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:34,000
You divide it into two halves. Right? So

186
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,760
you have between zero and a half and a

187
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,839
half and one. The whole sequence lie in

188
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,680
this interval.

189
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,720
So this means that there are either

190
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,160
infinitely many here or infinitely many

191
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:52,000
there. Right? Let's say that infinitely

192
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:56,240
many of the a lie in this interval.

193
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,880
Okay? So then we're going to

194
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,200
forward we were going to just focus on

195
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:05,200
this interval and on sub intervals of

196
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,440
this. Okay. So the we need we have

197
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,839
defined a1

198
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:18,120
a now we want to define and b1 and c1

199
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,120
then so now assume again assume

200
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,920
that infinite many

201
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:37,920
lie in this interval right so then we

202
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,600
make um we a n2 the second element in a

203
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,279
subsequence

204
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,480
we let it be the next element after a1

205
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:51,480
that is in this smaller interval right

206
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,480
so this here is the second element

207
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:01,760
in the original sequence

208
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,760
[Applause]

209
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,190
that lies

210
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:09,190
[Applause]

211
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,320
in the interval from 0 to a half.

212
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,959
Okay,

213
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,440
that's a n2, right? We don't want to

214
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,279
have a1 again, right? We need another

215
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,560
element because it's otherwise it's not

216
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,680
going to be a subsequence. You can't

217
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,519
pick a pick the A1 we already I mean it

218
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,639
could be the same value but it's it will

219
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:36,160
have to come from a different subscript.

220
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,639
Okay. Now B2

221
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,440
is then just going to be the left end

222
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,560
point of this interval. So this is again

223
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,720
zero and C2

224
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,040
is going to be the right end point of

225
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,519
this interval we're now focusing on. So

226
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,519
that's a half.

227
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:00,000
Now

228
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,440
uh so now to the next. So now how do we

229
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,440
construct the third element in the

230
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,320
subsequence

231
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,519
and the corresponding

232
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,600
B's and C's.

233
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,320
Okay. The thing is that and here you

234
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,680
have to be a little bit careful because

235
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,320
now we we we we

236
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,959
assumed that there was infinitely many

237
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,920
elements in the sequence that lie in

238
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,160
this smaller interval. You are going to

239
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,600
only from here on out you're going to

240
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,839
only look at those infinitely many.

241
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,480
You're not going to care about you know

242
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,720
so this may be the fifth the seventh the

243
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,000
15th element in the original sequence.

244
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,160
You're not going to worry about what

245
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,199
lies here, right? And so now you divide

246
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,680
this one here into two halves. This

247
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,880
interval between zero and a half, you

248
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,160
divide it into two halves.

249
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,720
And so so now imagine you have then the

250
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,880
picture here. Here you have zero. Here

251
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,440
you have uh a half.

252
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,279
And then you divide it into this

253
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,040
interval from zero to half. You divide

254
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,760
it into

255
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,720
two equally

256
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,560
large intervals. So

257
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,199
now

258
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,079
we already we're just focusing on the

259
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,440
infinitely many of the original sequence

260
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:30,240
that lie here. But of those infinitely

261
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,440
many either infinite many lie here or

262
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,839
infinitely many lie there. Right?

263
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,680
Let's say that that there's only

264
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,800
finitely many here. Say but there are

265
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,120
infinitely many here. Right? So if

266
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,720
there's infinitely many in this interval

267
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,600
here, then from here on out, you would

268
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,360
only focus on those infinite many. And

269
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,880
the next element would be right we know

270
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,880
that uh right the next element would be

271
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,759
the next element after the the one you

272
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,519
pick to be the second element in the

273
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,720
subsequence

274
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,720
that would lie in this in this

275
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:17,920
subsequence. Right? So we define a3

276
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:22,560
is now the next element. So a N3

277
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:28,800
this is now this element that lies in in

278
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:35,600
in this interval here right and then B

279
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:37,920
B3 is then going to be 1 / 4 and B uh

280
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,120
sorry and C3

281
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:46,399
is going to be the right uh end point of

282
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:49,399
this interval 1 over 4 one over two

283
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,399
Right?

284
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,040
And then you continue, right? Then you

285
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,880
continue this way. So let me just make

286
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,320
sure that it's totally clear. Let me

287
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,759
just go over how how we did it.

288
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,039
Right? So, so just because I want to be

289
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,120
careful that you, you know, once you, so

290
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,000
we started with the interval from 0 to

291
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,160
one, the first element you just pick in

292
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,439
the subsequence that was just the first

293
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,480
element in the original sequence and the

294
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,839
B1 was just the left endpoint here. So

295
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,720
that was zero. C1 was the right endpoint

296
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:30,400
that was one.

297
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,799
Now you divide it into two and one of

298
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,280
the two half potentially of course both

299
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,160
of the two half could have infinite many

300
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,679
elements in the original sequence. You

301
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,919
just focus on one of the two half that

302
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,840
have infinite elements, right? If

303
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,000
they're both fine, but you just take one

304
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,400
of them, right?

305
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,160
And so from here on out, we're just

306
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,400
going to focus on those infinitely many.

307
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,760
And then you're going to pick the next

308
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:04,160
one after the the A1 that lies in that

309
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,120
interval you're focusing on. That's the

310
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,240
second element in a subsequence. And the

311
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,720
B's will always be the left end point of

312
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,039
the interval. The C's will be the right

313
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,080
end point of the interval.

314
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,640
Then when you do the third element, then

315
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,520
you have to remember that you were

316
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,760
looking at infinitely many. And so now

317
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,720
it's like you're looking at you divide

318
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,080
this interval into two.

319
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,600
And now either this one here or that one

320
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,919
here has infinite many, right? and you

321
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,640
pick whatever it is. I mean, I guess we

322
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:44,080
we assumed it was this interval.

323
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,480
And then the next element after the the

324
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,799
two first you picked in the original

325
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,640
sequence, the next element that lies in

326
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,720
this that's going to be your third

327
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:57,280
element of the sequence. And then still

328
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,039
the B's will be then of this interval

329
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,760
you're focusing on would be the left end

330
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,799
point and the C the right end point.

331
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,000
Right? If you do that, you see each time

332
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,559
you're halfing it. So it means well it

333
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,760
first of all it means that the that the

334
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:18,080
bees are going to be increasing right

335
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,600
because it's always right each time you

336
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,919
divide into a half and it's always and

337
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,080
but it's like the interval you focus on

338
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,440
previously you divide into a half like

339
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,919
this and then you either you pick either

340
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,000
this point or that point right and this

341
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,480
here was the previous one right so the

342
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,760
bees will always be increasing

343
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,440
Likewise, the C's will be a decreasing

344
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,000
sequence.

345
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:49,360
And you also see

346
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:53,760
that the difference between CK say CK +

347
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:56,880
1 minus B K + one that the difference

348
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,679
here, right? But the difference is going

349
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,000
to be like half of the length of the

350
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,120
previous interval, right? So the

351
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,840
difference here is going to be 1/2. it's

352
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:11,280
actually going to be 12

353
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,880
uh and then B C

354
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:18,720
minus BK.

355
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,880
So you're getting this form right and so

356
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,840
and now if you just use that you're

357
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,640
starting with if you're just using that

358
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,000
the aridium. So when so you get this

359
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:36,720
recursive formula here

360
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:39,760
and you also have that c uh 1 minus b1

361
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,679
this is the length of the original

362
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:47,039
interval right because b1 was zero c1

363
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,360
was one so this is one

364
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:54,000
and so you're just putting this in and

365
00:20:49,360 --> 00:21:01,840
so you get the formula that c k minus bk

366
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:05,440
K is equal to 2 to the uh 1 minus K.

367
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,240
So you're getting this formula here.

368
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,919
This just come from this recursive

369
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,720
formula and how this starts right. See

370
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,480
this give you this. Okay. And so you see

371
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,039
that the length of these interval

372
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:24,000
becomes smaller and smaller. Again the

373
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:27,280
sequence BK is increasing the CK is

374
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,600
decreasing. So this means that this here

375
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,799
is converging to some B. This here is

376
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,039
converging to some C. And because the

377
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,880
difference between these goes to zero.

378
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,039
Then the B must be equal to C.

379
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,480
Right?

380
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:48,080
and and so this will prove that the

381
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:52,280
limit that you construct because the the

382
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,280
this is going to be squeezed

383
00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:05,440
you have this property that if you're

384
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:11,200
looking at a k and even uh sorry a n k

385
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:13,919
and even a uh n l

386
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:19,200
that this thing here. This here will by

387
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:22,320
construction will lie between these two

388
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,880
but all the later ones will also lie in

389
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,240
this interval. Right? So this here will

390
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,600
also lie in this interval

391
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,120
CK as long as L here is bigger equal to

392
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,720
K.

393
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,159
Right?

394
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,159
And so you see that this thing here this

395
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,080
thing here will because this here is

396
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,240
converging

397
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,559
to B and this is actually now we prove

398
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,320
that this converts to the same number B.

399
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,840
So this means that these guys here that

400
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,200
is squeezed between these two other

401
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:58,679
sequence will also converge

402
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,679
to B. Okay. So that's a vol.

403
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:09,440
Okay. Another key concept is um in this

404
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:12,440
class is the concept of a series.

405
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,440
Um

406
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,760
and

407
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,679
and so so this is the concept of a

408
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,679
series.

409
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:39,120
U and so a series is like as follows

410
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:43,480
that suppose you have so let

411
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,480
a n be a sequence

412
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,880
from a sequence you can form another

413
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,919
sequence and you can form another

414
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,640
sequence the following way that s so we

415
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,440
form

416
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,440
another sequence

417
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:12,640
And that is that uh s1 and we call this

418
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,919
other sequence sn another sequence sn

419
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:20,640
and uh and the sequence is defined as

420
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:25,520
follows that s_ub_1 is a1

421
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,840
s_ub_2 is a1 + a2

422
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:35,039
s3 3

423
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:39,279
is uh a1 + a2 + a3.

424
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:42,559
Um, S4 is where you summing the first

425
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:45,559
four element in this in the original

426
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,559
sequence

427
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,640
and and then you write sorry this is

428
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,760
first four element and then you write

429
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:58,960
the nth element you write it just as a

430
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:02,120
sum where I equals to one say to N of

431
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,120
the AIS.

432
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:08,799
So, so if you have a a sequence then you

433
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,400
can form another sequence

434
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:16,000
and this is this we denote by s and this

435
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:19,360
here is this here is so we really so

436
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,240
this here other sequence if a sequence

437
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:29,919
is of this form then you call it a

438
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:34,080
series so so uh so sn here so but sn is

439
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:37,480
just a sequence this here is called is

440
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,480
said to be

441
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,120
a series.

442
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:50,400
Okay.

443
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:53,440
Now um let's let's go to the most so I'm

444
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,679
sure m probably everybody have heard

445
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,880
about that's a kind of one of the famous

446
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,039
Greek paradoxes is this with I mean they

447
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,360
have various different forms is this

448
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:08,640
with one form of it is with Achilles and

449
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,679
the turtle where the turtle is getting a

450
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,799
head start of Achilles and the paradox

451
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,360
is that because the turtle have a head

452
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,120
start, then Achilles can never catch up

453
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,400
with the turtle even though the turtle

454
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,960
is moving incredibly slowly because in

455
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:29,360
order to catch up with the turtle then

456
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:32,159
Achilles first have have to go um half

457
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,960
of the distance that the turtle have

458
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,760
gone and then once you have done that he

459
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,120
have to go half of the distance that he

460
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:44,080
that the turtle now have traveled etc

461
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,760
and so this go on infinitely long and

462
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,120
Therefore, he can never catch up with

463
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,919
the turtle. There's various other

464
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,039
version of this, right? But that and

465
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,600
that's exactly a series and like and

466
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,400
this is also like the most important

467
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,919
series is what's called the geometric

468
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,919
series.

469
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:07,440
So the geometric series.

470
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,320
So this is a you know the most important

471
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,919
uh series and it's the most important

472
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,440
because it's kind of a non-trivial

473
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:18,559
series that can be used to determine

474
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:23,840
whether other series or whether these

475
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:26,880
other for other sums whether these uh

476
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:30,000
this sequence sn whether it converges or

477
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,760
not. So the geometric series is the

478
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,760
following that C you take some number C

479
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:40,720
and then you are summing uh this number

480
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,520
but to a power so you're looking at

481
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,440
where you have some power say from zero

482
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,640
to n

483
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:55,520
right so this means that um so this is

484
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:58,399
SN so it mean that s uh s zero uh this

485
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:02,960
is just where you have

486
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:07,039
where you have uh by C to the power zero

487
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,960
by definition is one and s1 is then when

488
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:13,679
you're summing

489
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:20,159
c to the power z plus c to ^ 1. So

490
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:22,520
that's just uh 1 + c and s_ub_2 is then

491
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,069
uh s_ub_2 is then

492
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,069
[Applause]

493
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:38,000
s_2 is then uh c 0 + c1

494
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:39,840
+ c². So that's just 1 + uh c + uh c²,

495
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,399
right? Etc.

496
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:47,039
So that's a geometric series where it's

497
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:51,200
just a number and each time you multiply

498
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:53,840
that number by itself the end time and

499
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,120
then you're adding it to the previous.

500
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:01,039
So that's the geometric series. Okay.

501
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:04,480
And now and the reason why this is uh

502
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:07,120
important is that this is very useful to

503
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,039
determine whether other series are

504
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,919
convergent or not because you can

505
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:15,600
compare it. You can compare other series

506
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:18,159
with the geometric series

507
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,480
and the geometric series is easy to

508
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,480
determine whether it's convergent or

509
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,159
not. And so this is because of the

510
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:29,120
following little calculation here. Let's

511
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:36,240
suppose I'm looking at some summing here

512
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:42,000
from zero to N of C to the power I

513
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:44,559
and now I multiply this with C. Right?

514
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,520
So then this here would just be where

515
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:51,360
I'm summing here. You see if I multiply

516
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:54,960
by C I can move that C inside and then

517
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,559
the first time it's really right. So you

518
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,200
can write this thing here. So let me

519
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:04,720
just write it out. So this is C and then

520
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:09,360
it's 1 + C + C 2 + CQ

521
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:12,159
etc like that up to C uh N.

522
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:18,320
And if you multiply by C then of course

523
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:22,640
this is just C + C ^2 + C cub up to

524
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:25,120
uh C to the N + one. Okay.

525
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,279
And so this means that if you take this

526
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,679
thing here, so if you take if you're

527
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:35,520
looking at this sum from zero to n of CI

528
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:39,279
and now you multiply by 1 minus C,

529
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:42,080
right? Then this here is the same as

530
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,880
this here is the same as

531
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,960
just one times this. So let me just

532
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,159
write it out. This is what this just

533
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,840
give you the in original series. So this

534
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:57,039
gives you this up to CN. That's when we

535
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:00,320
multiply the one in when we multiply it

536
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,240
by minus C then we get this thing here

537
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:09,320
with a minus sign. So we're getting

538
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:09,320
minus C. Um so I can write like this

539
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,520
like that.

540
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,000
But now you see that there's a lot of

541
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,520
cancellation, right? This thing here

542
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
cancel

543
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,640
with this here. The next one would

544
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,799
cancel with this. This here would cancel

545
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,360
with the second last, right? And so you

546
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,440
were only left with this one here and

547
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,880
that one here. But the this one here

548
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:40,640
comes in with a minus sign. So this is 1

549
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:45,240
minus c to the n + one.

550
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,240
Okay. So we have this little formula

551
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:58,559
have this little formula say that if you

552
00:31:52,480 --> 00:32:02,159
take uh if you take 1 minus c and you

553
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:06,240
sum from i = z

554
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,919
to n ci

555
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:14,399
right this is what we did here then

556
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:16,000
you're getting 1 - 1 - c to the n + one.

557
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,519
Okay.

558
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,240
So now of course if c if c is one let's

559
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:26,960
wait with figuring it out but assume

560
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:30,080
that c here is not equal to one

561
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:36,000
then I can write this here

562
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:38,240
as that this sum here i = z to n ci I

563
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,640
can just divide here by this here on

564
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:47,880
both sides. So I get this thing here

565
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,880
1 minus C. So I have this formula here

566
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,240
assuming that C is not equal to one. So

567
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:58,720
I can divide by 1 minus C.

568
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:02,240
And now you see that um so now we can

569
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:06,039
now from this here we can determine so

570
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,039
we can prove a little theorem.

571
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,840
So that the geometric series so this is

572
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,840
geometric series convergence

573
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,240
convergence.

574
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:25,440
Right?

575
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,000
Remember that this this thing here. So a

576
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,039
series here. So maybe I should just

577
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,039
emphasize that over here.

578
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,399
So if you write down a series, so again

579
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,000
a series is always that you're starting

580
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:45,519
with a sequence like this and then you

581
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,399
form this other sequence sn where you're

582
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:51,440
summing the first

583
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,919
um the first n you know I guess in this

584
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,760
case now I'm starting from zero so then

585
00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:00,399
it would be n plus one elements

586
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,519
like this

587
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:08,000
and and and and sometimes one also just

588
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:10,720
write for the series one write it as

589
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:14,240
as this where one

590
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,040
uh one write like this here

591
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,399
but uh but really what you're thinking

592
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,280
about is this sequence here and so but

593
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:26,320
you you sort of with a slight abuse of

594
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,399
notation you write this here for a

595
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,159
series but what you're thinking about is

596
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:35,159
this sequence And so a series is

597
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,159
convergent.

598
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,240
It is convergent.

599
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:50,440
Uh just means

600
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,440
that the sequence

601
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,800
sn is convergent.

602
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,359
Okay. So it just means that that that

603
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:09,200
this sequence sn is convergent

604
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:11,920
and the and the and the sum and the

605
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:16,000
limit

606
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,960
of the sequence series

607
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,960
this is just the limit

608
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,960
um is the limit

609
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,960
of the sn

610
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,000
That's called that is usually denoted

611
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:46,880
denoted

612
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:49,920
by by by this uh by this infinite sum

613
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:53,920
a sorry this was I

614
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,720
ai like that right so so you see there's

615
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,160
a little bit of abuse of notation

616
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,960
that one one talk about a series and one

617
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:06,000
typically write it like this. What one

618
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,880
really mean is that one think about this

619
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,160
sequence here and then if it's

620
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,839
convergent this just means that these Sn

621
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,560
converge

622
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:19,520
and the limit the limit but the limit

623
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,320
you would also write as this. So in a

624
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,160
way this symbol here is used for two

625
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,160
different things. it's used for the

626
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:31,200
series and if the series is convergent

627
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,400
it's also used for the limit. Okay, this

628
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,720
is like standard. So,

629
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,119
okay. So, now let's come back to the

630
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,680
geometric series, right? So, again the

631
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,280
geometric series were that you take some

632
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,520
C

633
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:52,240
and then you form this series here

634
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,640
C I I = Z to infinity. It's it's of

635
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,440
course important where you start. I mean

636
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,680
it's the convergence is not important

637
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,599
but the what the limit is depends on

638
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:08,880
where you start. Okay. So so this is a

639
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:12,960
geometric series and we have that if um

640
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:18,920
if see here so we have now the following

641
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,920
that um that the geometric series

642
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,520
series

643
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,520
is convergent

644
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,599
if

645
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:35,680
if C here in absolute value is less than

646
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:41,079
one

647
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,079
uh and uh and divergent otherwise

648
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,079
if as the absolute value of C is bigger

649
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,160
to one.

650
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:59,440
Okay. So, so this is the claim that okay

651
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:03,599
and so this is and and so this is a

652
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:09,680
claim and and in fact um

653
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:14,599
right and and in fact so one more thing

654
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,599
is that that

655
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,960
so moreover

656
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:30,160
If uh if C

657
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,920
is less than one then the limit so so so

658
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,400
then the claim is that it's convergent

659
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,400
then the limit

660
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:46,960
is uh one one minus 2. This here has a

661
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:50,359
limit and so we write this here as the

662
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,359
this infin.

663
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:00,720
Okay. Now let's just try to prove this.

664
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,640
So let me first do and we have we almost

665
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,359
there already.

666
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,359
So the thing is

667
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,359
that

668
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,000
Right. So let's first look at the case

669
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,280
uh assume

670
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,680
C in absolute value it's less than

671
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:36,680
strictly less than one. Well, then we

672
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:36,680
have already proven that Sn is so sn

673
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:46,480
I = 0 to N CI and we have already proven

674
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:50,720
that this here is 1 minus CN + 1 over 1

675
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,960
- C right and this makes sense C is

676
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,359
strictly norm is strictly less than one

677
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,400
so in particular C is not one right so

678
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,240
this here is is fine but now you see

679
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,720
that If you take something with norm

680
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:07,839
strictly less than one, then just

681
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:10,560
because CN + one, the norm of this here,

682
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:13,599
well, if you take a something and you

683
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,720
multiply it by another, so so if you

684
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,400
take two numbers a and b and you take

685
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,800
the absolute value of the product,

686
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,960
that's the same as the product of the

687
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,880
absolute values,

688
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,400
right? So, so this means that if you

689
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,680
take C to the power n + one, so if you

690
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,079
take C and you multiply it by self, n +

691
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,280
one time, this is the same as the

692
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:40,400
absolute value times to raised to the

693
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,200
power n plus one, right? And so now you

694
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,920
see that because this c has absolute

695
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,440
value less than one, strictly less than

696
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:53,040
one, then as n go to infinity, this here

697
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:57,599
converts to zero. Right? So this means

698
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,880
that as n go to infinity this thing here

699
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:04,000
right converge this here goes to zero.

700
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,640
So just by the algebraic rules for

701
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,880
limits right this thing here is going to

702
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:14,359
converge to one minus C over one like

703
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,359
that right

704
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:21,520
so you see that in the case where the

705
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:24,160
where C in absolute value is strictly

706
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,720
less than one then we have now proven

707
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,040
that the geometric series is convergent

708
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,520
and in fact we have even which is really

709
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,599
nice and and sort of unusual for a

710
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,160
series. I mean, usually you cannot

711
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,119
actually determine what the limit is,

712
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,680
but in this case, we could, right? But

713
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,599
we still need to figure out why is it

714
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:52,400
not convergent if C

715
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:54,640
is um the absolute value of C is bigger

716
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,160
or equal to one.

717
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,000
And so here's an easy thing.

718
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,319
I mean, but you could also kind of I

719
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,079
mean, yeah. So, here's an easy thing

720
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:08,480
that if you're looking at C, sorry, SN +

721
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,079
1 minus SN,

722
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:15,440
right?

723
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:19,040
Well, SN + one or SN say this here was

724
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:24,960
just right. This here was just C to the

725
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:26,560
power zero up to C to the power n S N +

726
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,200
one

727
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,160
is where you do the same stuff. You're

728
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,520
adding these guys,

729
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,839
but then you have to add one more,

730
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:42,000
right? So this means that this

731
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:45,280
difference here is really C to the N +

732
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,599
one, right?

733
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,640
But now I could look at the absolute

734
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,760
value of this difference.

735
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:57,760
This is this

736
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,480
but this is the same again as C to the

737
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:04,560
power n + one.

738
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:07,599
But you see if C here is the absolute

739
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,800
value is bigger equal to one then this

740
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,440
thing here then this thing here so if

741
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,800
the absolute value here is bigger equal

742
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:21,440
to one then this thing here must be big

743
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:24,319
or equal to one right remember that if a

744
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,839
sequence is convergent if a sequence is

745
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:30,319
convergent then it is a cushy sequence

746
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:33,359
it's a cushy sequence that if you go

747
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:36,960
sufficiently far out then from there on

748
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:40,240
and out everything bunch very very close

749
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,200
together but you see here not even two

750
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,920
consecutive is bunching together because

751
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,960
independent on how far out how large n

752
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,440
is the difference is always at least one

753
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,800
right so this is not even a cus I mean

754
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,800
this well I mean it's actually

755
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,440
equivalent of course but it's not a cus

756
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,400
sequence it sort of failed like the most

757
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:04,079
basic thing with consecutive ones

758
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:07,520
does not even lie close together. So

759
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,240
this proved this uh this theorem about

760
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,640
the geometric convergence the geometric

761
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:17,599
series convergence.

762
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:21,040
Okay. So now so this is like

763
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,839
the most important example of a

764
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:27,599
sequence. Um

765
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:32,440
maybe the second most important

766
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,440
is what's called the harmonic series.

767
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,599
So harmonic series

768
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,200
and but the harmonic series is

769
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,000
unfortunately not a series that is

770
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,079
convergent. So the harmonic series is

771
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,119
the following. So I again I'm writing it

772
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:59,839
I'm using this abusive notation

773
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:03,760
that I'm writing the series as like a

774
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:06,480
infinite sum but this infinite sum you

775
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,240
know but it's not a convergent series.

776
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:12,800
So the infinite sum doesn't really make

777
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,720
sense. So so this is the here I have to

778
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,040
start because I'm dividing by n. So I'm

779
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,760
starting by one with one. So this here

780
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:24,640
is called the harmonic sh.

781
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:27,599
Okay. and and um and there's there's

782
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:30,960
various so for series

783
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:34,160
and for series there's like a sort of

784
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,240
bunch of things bunch of tests that are

785
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,119
useful to determine whether a series is

786
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,400
converging or not right and but there's

787
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,720
but and and the ones and we'll talk

788
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,319
about these tests I talk a little bit

789
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,480
about later in this lecture I'll talk

790
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,400
about some of the tests but not all of

791
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,000
them and and we will later talk about

792
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,760
more the test that is particular useful

793
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,280
in this case it's what's called the

794
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,200
integral test but I won't talk about

795
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:04,240
that today

796
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:07,440
um but instead I will show you a very

797
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:11,160
simple proof of why this here

798
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,160
is not convergent

799
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:18,440
so uh so so here's a theorem

800
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,720
The harmonic series

801
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,280
is a divergence. It's not conver it's

802
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,280
diverg.

803
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,880
Okay. And so in fact what we will prove

804
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,640
is the following

805
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:47,119
that we will show that if you're looking

806
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:52,240
at so n is an integer. If you're looking

807
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:55,440
at at so this is this is like so this is

808
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:58,160
like a right this is only some of the

809
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:02,240
you know you only hit for this here you

810
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:04,160
only hit some of the um element in the

811
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:11,280
sequence right so this is where I'm

812
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:16,160
summing again from i = 1 to 2 n to 2 to

813
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:19,760
the n minus one n is an integer of 1 I

814
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:21,280
right so I want to prove that these guys

815
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,000
here

816
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,839
if if the original sequence has been

817
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,800
convergent then of course any

818
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:30,960
subsequence would also be convergent and

819
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:36,720
we're going to prove that this thing

820
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:42,119
here is big or equal to n /2 so I claim

821
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:42,119
that we have this so this is a claim

822
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:48,560
that you have this But if you have this

823
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,280
thing here, you see that then the se

824
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,680
this subsequence here is unbounded.

825
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,000
Right? So of course the original

826
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,440
harmonic series is not convergent.

827
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,200
Right? So let's try to prove this. And

828
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:06,640
again you know this is not um this is

829
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,880
just like a simple proof of that very

830
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,119
simple minor proof that the harmonic

831
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:15,920
series is divergent

832
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:17,359
but but there are you know more

833
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,000
you know once we learn about the

834
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:24,480
integral test and so on there are other

835
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,559
in a way better ways of doing it.

836
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,760
So let me try to prove this. So I want

837
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:34,040
to prove the claim

838
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,040
prove of of the claim.

839
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:42,160
So I'm going to prove it by so I just

840
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:46,160
prove so so I want to establish this for

841
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:49,839
all n and I'm going to prove it first

842
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:53,520
when um when n

843
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:55,839
is equal to one. Right? So let's show

844
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,599
this for n equal to one.

845
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:04,640
So for n= to one

846
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:08,160
well then the claim here means that um

847
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:13,520
right so 2 to the one that's two so this

848
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:17,520
is this is s1 right right because two to

849
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:21,599
the one is 2 minus one so this is one so

850
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:25,839
I claim that so so I want to prove that

851
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:29,400
s1 is bigger equal to a

852
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,400
want to show

853
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:38,400
but of course S1 here S1 is just one

854
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:42,960
over one so it's actually that's

855
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:46,480
definitely fine okay so this is so it's

856
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:51,119
for so we we so so we want to prove the

857
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:53,440
claim and the claim is okay so claim is

858
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:58,079
okay

859
00:49:53,440 --> 00:50:04,040
for n = 1. Okay. So now I want to prove

860
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:04,040
it. So I want to assume so assume

861
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,200
the claim

862
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,359
is correct

863
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:20,760
for for N and we want to prove it for

864
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,760
want to show it

865
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,559
to show the claim

866
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,800
for

867
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:37,640
for the next one, right? And so I I have

868
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,640
that. So we we have we assume

869
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:47,839
that s2 n

870
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:54,240
minus one that this is bigger than n /2

871
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:57,040
and then I want to look at uh s 2 n + 1

872
00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:01,359
-1. Okay, how can I write this thing

873
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:04,880
here? So I'm summing, right? This here

874
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:07,520
is a sum of the one over I where I do it

875
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,800
up to this thing here. But I can think

876
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:14,640
about that as a sum of the one where I

877
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:18,720
do up to this here

878
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:26,319
and then then I have to sorry sum the

879
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:29,440
rest also. So this is I = to 2 n to 2 n

880
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:34,319
+ 1

881
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:41,000
2 n sorry + 1 - 1

882
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:41,000
like this of 1 / i right

883
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:47,200
but now you see

884
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:50,079
I want to bound it from below

885
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:53,200
right so I

886
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:55,839
So if you sort of continue this line

887
00:51:53,200 --> 00:52:00,559
then by assumption this thing here is

888
00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:04,720
bounded by n /2 right this thing here

889
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:08,240
right I'm summing right I'm summing two

890
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,800
n numbers right from here to here there

891
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:13,119
are two n numbers

892
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:17,040
right

893
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:19,119
and uh and so it's two n numbers and if

894
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,200
I take the smallest of those two

895
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,640
numbers, right? If I take the smallest

896
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,640
of these guys and I multiply by 2 n,

897
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,359
then that's definitely a lower bound. So

898
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,599
let's try to do this. So I say 2 n 2 to

899
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:34,079
the n and then the smallest, but the

900
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:39,200
smallest is the last one. So the

901
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:42,880
smallest is 1 / 2 to the n + one

902
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:46,319
minus one, right?

903
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:49,520
But this thing here, right, is of course

904
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:51,599
obviously bigger than so n / two. This

905
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:55,200
thing here, well, this is 2 to the n.

906
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:57,839
But this thing here, if I divide by a

907
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,160
larger number, and the larger number is

908
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:04,640
just this here, then I get something

909
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:07,119
even smaller. So I would have 1 / 2 to

910
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,760
the n + one, right?

911
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,720
But now you see that this thing here

912
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:16,240
cancel with these guys here. And so

913
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:20,319
you're getting that this is n / 2 + a

914
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:24,319
half. And so this is n + one / two. And

915
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:27,200
that's exactly the claim for n + one.

916
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:30,800
Right? So we proven that if it was true

917
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:34,000
for n then it's also true for n + one.

918
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:37,280
And we remember to check that the

919
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,040
beginning was also okay.

920
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,800
Okay, so that's the harmonic series. So

921
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,599
you see that the harmonic series is

922
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,200
divergent.

923
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:48,319
Now

924
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:51,599
um the harmonic series is of course an

925
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:54,000
example of something else.

926
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:56,480
Namely that

927
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,960
if you're looking at so when you're

928
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:03,800
looking at a series

929
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:03,800
the first thing you look at typically is

930
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:14,000
Okay. So,

931
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:17,520
let me just have a side here. So,

932
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,280
if you give me a series,

933
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,359
you know, it doesn't really matter where

934
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,760
I mean it

935
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:26,319
it doesn't matter very much where it's

936
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,240
the for for whether a series is

937
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:30,319
convergent. It doesn't matter where you

938
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,680
start because this is just adding

939
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:35,680
something to it. It will matter where

940
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,680
you start for the limit but not whether

941
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:40,000
or not the sequence series is

942
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:43,520
converging. But if you give me a limit

943
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:49,000
the first thing I always check is that

944
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:49,000
this so first so so for a series

945
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,800
always check

946
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,599
if a n goes to zero or not.

947
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,559
And why? Because if you give me a

948
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:10,240
series, this the the the question about

949
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:13,440
a series is always whether it's

950
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:15,920
converging or not. Right? And again,

951
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,920
just like we did, if you're looking at

952
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,359
Sn

953
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,760
say minus SN minus one, this is where

954
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:26,000
I'm looking at two consecutive things,

955
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,400
right? But if I'm looking at this

956
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,839
difference here, the difference here,

957
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:34,559
this is where I'm summing up to the a n

958
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:38,720
minus one. Here I'm summing up to the a

959
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:41,040
n. So the difference here is a n. And if

960
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,280
the sequence just like we saw, if the

961
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,440
sequence of the series sorry is

962
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,000
convergent, it means that this sequence

963
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,079
here is convergent. But it means that it

964
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,119
has to be a cruise sequence that things

965
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:55,839
have to bunch together. But that two

966
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:58,079
consecutive bunchs together or not is

967
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:01,760
determined whether a n goes to zero or

968
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:04,000
not. So if a n does not go to zero, you

969
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,559
already done, right? There's no reason

970
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,960
to continue. It's already clear that

971
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,960
this if a end does not go to zero, you

972
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,640
can just say it it doesn't converge

973
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,319
because a end doesn't go to zero. So

974
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:18,240
there's no reason to start with any kind

975
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:21,240
of test or anything any sort of uh good

976
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,240
ideas.

977
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:28,319
Um okay so so that was just a side

978
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:31,760
remark. The other thing is that for the

979
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:35,920
the harmonic series is uh you know so

980
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:39,200
this of course failed this test

981
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:42,559
but but it also is an example of

982
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:44,480
something where you're taking a so

983
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:47,119
suppose you take a so you have a

984
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:51,960
sequence a n

985
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:51,960
and and then you're forming the series

986
00:56:53,920 --> 00:57:00,280
this here. Now, if all of the a

987
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,440
suppose that all of the a ends are non-

988
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:08,000
negative, right? Then if you're looking

989
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:12,559
at sn

990
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,640
+ one, you can think about sn + one as

991
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:17,359
where you're summing

992
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:20,960
the first

993
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:23,520
n elements and then you're adding

994
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:26,960
the n plus one elements. Right? So this

995
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:31,760
here you can think about as sn

996
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:34,160
plus a n + one. And so of course if you

997
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,920
have if all of these elements is non-

998
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,079
negative this means that this here is

999
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,720
non- negative. So this thing here is

1000
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:43,680
bigger than Sn. So you see that if all

1001
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:48,079
of the element a is non negative then

1002
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:50,640
this sequence sn is monotone. So in this

1003
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:53,040
case here if you have this this imply

1004
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:57,839
that this sn

1005
00:57:53,040 --> 00:58:01,760
is mono increasing right. And so now to

1006
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:04,079
say whether this in if you have this to

1007
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:07,680
determine whether this series here is

1008
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:10,160
convergent or not it's just a matter of

1009
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,960
proving whether you know to determine

1010
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:15,280
whether this this

1011
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:19,240
sequence is bounded or not. Right? So

1012
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,240
you just need to find a bound.

1013
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:27,440
Okay. So this naturally leads to looking

1014
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:29,200
at what's called absolute convergence.

1015
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,200
So this is something stronger than

1016
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,200
convergence.

1017
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,400
And for many things for many although

1018
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,240
not all

1019
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,079
there's a particular test that deals

1020
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:47,040
with it with uh where you don't have

1021
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:49,359
both things or where you don't have the

1022
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:53,839
stronger property. So for many things

1023
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:57,760
you are you have absolute convergence.

1024
00:58:53,839 --> 00:59:02,920
Um okay and um

1025
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,920
so let me try to so absolute conver.

1026
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:15,480
So again you have a um a series here.

1027
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:22,480
This series here is set to be absolute

1028
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:25,480
convergence or converge absolutely. So

1029
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,480
converge

1030
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,400
absolutely

1031
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:39,040
if if the co the series where you slap

1032
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:41,040
absolute values on them. If this thing

1033
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:44,040
here

1034
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,040
converge

1035
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,640
right?

1036
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:54,799
So if this so we say that this here

1037
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,799
converts absolutely if this here

1038
00:59:54,799 --> 01:00:03,440
converge. Okay. Now

1039
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:05,119
uh so I claim that uh that absolute

1040
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,119
convergence is stronger than

1041
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:08,119
convergence.

1042
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:21,559
So, so absolute

1043
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,200
convergence

1044
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:32,599
implies

1045
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,599
uh convergence.

1046
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,640
This is a theorem.

1047
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:44,079
But it's not the other way around,

1048
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:46,880
right? So if you have what's called the

1049
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,960
So here an example

1050
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,440
and and we haven't yet proved that it's

1051
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,760
converging, but we'll do that in some

1052
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,760
later lecture.

1053
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:06,160
So um so here's an example.

1054
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:10,319
If you're looking at the series minus

1055
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,400
one to the power n / n n n n n n n n n n

1056
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,720
n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n

1057
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,760
n n n n n n n n n n n = 1 to infinity.

1058
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:18,160
This here you see this is if if this

1059
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:22,240
hair just had been one then it had been

1060
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:25,200
the harmonic series. This here series is

1061
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:28,240
it's also kind of like a famous series.

1062
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:32,359
It's called the alternating

1063
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,359
alternating harmonic series.

1064
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:39,520
And it's alternating alternating mean

1065
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:43,040
that the sign of it is alternating

1066
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:45,680
right. So the sign of this a element it

1067
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,079
keep changing from guess in this case

1068
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,400
the first one is negative the next one

1069
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:54,960
is positive. So it go back and forth

1070
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:59,040
between uh uh back and forth uh around

1071
01:01:54,960 --> 01:02:03,319
zero. to a harmonic series.

1072
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:03,319
And this series is convergent

1073
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,359
is convergent

1074
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,079
but not absolutely convergent.

1075
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,200
Why? Because the the if you slap

1076
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,119
absolute value sign you get the

1077
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,200
harmonics is and we already know that

1078
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:24,839
this is not convergent but not

1079
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,839
absolutely converted.

1080
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:33,319
Okay.

1081
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:38,480
So this is the alternating harmonic

1082
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:41,760
series. Okay. Now let's try to prove

1083
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:44,720
that uh absolute convergence implies

1084
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,720
convergence.

1085
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:51,760
And so I'm going to look at so I take

1086
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:58,720
two series. So I have SN that's my

1087
01:02:51,760 --> 01:03:00,960
original series a I = Z to N like that.

1088
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:03,920
And then I take the one where I slap

1089
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,839
absolute value sign and I denote it with

1090
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:11,119
a bar.

1091
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:15,359
So I = to zero 2 N of A.

1092
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:18,640
And then I make a little observation

1093
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:21,520
and the observation is

1094
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:25,200
that if I take

1095
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:27,839
if I'm looking at

1096
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:33,680
SN and SM

1097
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:35,599
so just think about at N here is larger

1098
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:38,480
than N.

1099
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:41,280
Then you can think about this thing here

1100
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:46,839
as this thing here is just where you're

1101
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:46,839
summing from m + one

1102
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:57,039
n up to a n right that's this difference

1103
01:03:55,119 --> 01:04:01,280
right

1104
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:04,640
but if you take absolute value on this

1105
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:07,599
absolute value on that well that's a

1106
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:09,599
that's of of course less or equal to

1107
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:13,799
right where you're taking absolute value

1108
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,799
on each individual one

1109
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:28,640
like that.

1110
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:31,680
But this thing here is just this is just

1111
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:35,359
right this thing here is just for the

1112
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:38,839
the other series. this is it's the same

1113
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:38,839
sort of difference

1114
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,880
and and here actually I don't need to

1115
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,480
take absolute value but I could take

1116
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,200
absolute value but this is already non

1117
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:53,119
negative

1118
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:56,880
and so you see that so so you make this

1119
01:04:53,119 --> 01:05:00,000
little observation but now we know that

1120
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:02,559
if it is absolutely convergent then this

1121
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,200
sequence here converge so this means

1122
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:08,000
that in particular it's equivalent to

1123
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,839
saying that it's a cushy sequence and so

1124
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,160
this means that things if you are

1125
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:14,480
sufficiently far out these things here

1126
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:17,280
have bunched together epsilon together

1127
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:19,359
if you are bigger than some capital n

1128
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,680
but now this inequality say that these

1129
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:25,440
things here bunch together so you see

1130
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:28,799
that that if this is convergent

1131
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:31,280
then it's a cy sequence but this means

1132
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:33,440
that this here is a cy sequence so it

1133
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:36,440
means that there are vision series was

1134
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,440
converged.

1135
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:46,799
Okay. Um

1136
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:49,359
and so now let's look at one more

1137
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:51,920
example and then then we'll talk about

1138
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:53,760
some of the tests.

1139
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:57,760
Um

1140
01:05:53,760 --> 01:06:03,440
yeah. So let's look at so we we we saw

1141
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:03,440
that the harmonic series is divergent.

1142
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Um

1143
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:14,000
so we saw that the harmonic series is

1144
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:18,280
divergent

1145
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,280
but let's what about

1146
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:25,520
right I mean and what about so this is

1147
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:28,160
another thing you could do right so

1148
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:31,039
maybe the most important

1149
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:33,359
series is the geometric series after

1150
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,000
that you can debate a little bit which

1151
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:38,079
series is the most important and but

1152
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:43,039
these here is some other candidates for

1153
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:49,039
that. Um, so I'm looking at now the sum

1154
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:51,760
here n = 0 to infinity.

1155
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:56,720
Uh, and I'm looking at

1156
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:58,799
uh 1 / n squares. But you could do it

1157
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:01,440
more generally where you raise it to

1158
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:03,839
some power. Right? If that power was

1159
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,000
one, you got the alternating, you got

1160
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:08,880
the harmonic series. But I'm now I'm

1161
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,280
just looking at a specific power two.

1162
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:14,640
Okay.

1163
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:20,400
And so I claim that that this series

1164
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:21,839
here this here is um this here is um I

1165
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:25,839
mean this one doesn't really have a name

1166
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:28,319
but it is a key series. And so I claim

1167
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:31,319
that this here is convergence. So this

1168
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:31,319
is

1169
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:43,599
now

1170
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:46,880
You observe that the a n in this case

1171
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:49,760
this is just 1 / n^2 right and these

1172
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:52,240
here are non- negative. So all we need

1173
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,119
to do is so we just need to prove. So

1174
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:58,559
this is when the a ends are non negative

1175
01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:02,400
all you need to prove is that that the

1176
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:05,400
sequence you just need to prove need to

1177
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,400
show

1178
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,520
that the SN which is where you're

1179
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,520
summing here

1180
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:23,440
I = uh you can't you shouldn't sum from

1181
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:25,120
zero sum from one I = to uh one to n

1182
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:27,600
that you will need to prove that these

1183
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:30,560
here are bounded

1184
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:34,199
and this is because the a

1185
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,199
ends are non negative.

1186
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:43,920
Okay. So now the idea here is that um I

1187
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:47,040
mean again this is not

1188
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:50,960
um this is not necessarily how I would

1189
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:54,480
do it but um if but this the advantage

1190
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:57,120
with this here is that it doesn't use

1191
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:59,839
anything fancy. I mean it's not like the

1192
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:02,000
the the way later on you would do it

1193
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:03,520
will you would use the integral test but

1194
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,920
we haven't talked about this integral

1195
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:08,000
test yet. So you can do it very simple

1196
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,759
mindedly.

1197
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:17,040
And so the claim here is that

1198
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:19,520
um that um that you want to compare.

1199
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:22,719
So we want to we want to make a

1200
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:26,159
following claim

1201
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:31,040
uh that um

1202
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:35,920
that um that if you're looking at s to

1203
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:38,799
the 2 n + one sorry f to the 2 n. So

1204
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,560
it's just similar to what we did before.

1205
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:44,000
If we want to prove we want to prove

1206
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:46,719
that this thing here uh for this uh

1207
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:55,280
series that this is less than the sum

1208
01:09:46,719 --> 01:10:00,800
here from i uh equal to uh zero to n of

1209
01:09:55,280 --> 01:10:02,880
12 to the power i. So we'll put n minus

1210
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:06,320
one.

1211
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:09,679
So we claim this thing here.

1212
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:13,760
Now you see that so we claim that we

1213
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:17,600
have this inequality for all in right

1214
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:22,280
but um this thing here we already know

1215
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,280
that this here is a geometric series

1216
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:31,560
series

1217
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:31,560
with C = to a half so it's convergent

1218
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:37,600
and you see this thing here is a subsequ

1219
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,840
sequence

1220
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:44,000
but it's a subsequence because this here

1221
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:46,400
is convergent. This here is this here is

1222
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,800
yeah right this here is bounded by

1223
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:52,320
something fixed right so it means that

1224
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:56,239
this subsequence here is bounded

1225
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:58,800
but the original series was a mono

1226
01:10:56,239 --> 01:11:02,159
increasing sequence. So if a subsequence

1227
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:04,480
is bounded then the original sequence is

1228
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:07,199
bounded and and so convergent right. So

1229
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:09,679
we just need to prove we just need to

1230
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:11,199
give a bound like this and the bound

1231
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,199
here you get is but we already

1232
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:18,800
determined that this here is less or

1233
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:21,920
equal to one over 1 minus c. C is a

1234
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:25,120
half. So this is like this. So this here

1235
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:27,199
is a half. So this whole thing here is

1236
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:30,400
two.

1237
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:35,199
So this here would be bounded by two.

1238
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:37,360
Right? Okay. So now we want to prove so

1239
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:40,080
we want to prove this claim here. So if

1240
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:44,080
we can prove this claim then we have

1241
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:46,239
that the series this series here is

1242
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:50,480
convergent.

1243
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:53,760
Okay. So now let's let's let's try to do

1244
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:57,280
that. So when

1245
01:11:53,760 --> 01:12:00,400
n is equal to one so we we do it again

1246
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,320
in the same way.

1247
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,960
This is called by induction. We do it

1248
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:13,120
for first for

1249
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:16,080
for n = 1 for n = 1 it is a claim that s

1250
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:18,560
right if n is equal to one this is 2

1251
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:21,040
minus one that's one so it's a claim

1252
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:24,640
that this thing here

1253
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:26,239
is uh is bigger equals is lesser equal

1254
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:29,199
to

1255
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:31,280
and now it's when n is equal to one it's

1256
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:34,480
just this is you're just summing over

1257
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:37,440
one thing. It's just one thing and it is

1258
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:40,800
a half to the power zero and that's one.

1259
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:43,800
So for n= 1, this is what we need to

1260
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,800
show.

1261
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:51,199
Okay.

1262
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:54,719
But now let's see

1263
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:58,800
for n equal to one. Well, this here is

1264
01:12:54,719 --> 01:13:02,239
indeed one. So that's okay, right?

1265
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,239
So this is okay.

1266
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,480
So now assume

1267
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:23,840
assume that s ^ 2n -1 is bounded by this

1268
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:26,880
i = 0 to n -1 of 12 to the power i.

1269
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:31,760
Right? So assume this and we want to

1270
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:35,159
prove the same thing but for n + one. So

1271
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:35,159
want to show

1272
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:40,280
the same inequality

1273
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:49,560
for

1274
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:49,560
n + one. Okay.

1275
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:54,280
So let me do that.

1276
01:13:58,030 --> 01:14:08,159
[Applause]

1277
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:12,880
So I'm looking at s 2 n + 1 -1.

1278
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:18,880
So s 2n + 1 - one I can write as where

1279
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:22,800
I'm summing the first 2 n minus one

1280
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:25,840
and then I'm I'm summing

1281
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:35,280
and then plus and then I'm what I'm

1282
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:40,159
summing from I equ= to 2 n to uh up to 2

1283
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:46,159
n + 1 - one

1284
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:49,280
right and then it's 1 / i^ 2

1285
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:50,880
now in this case remember before we

1286
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:52,000
wanted to prove that something was

1287
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,239
divergent

1288
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,560
So we wanted to give a lower bound. In

1289
01:14:54,239 --> 01:15:00,159
this case we want to give a upper bound.

1290
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:03,040
So when we do this we think about what

1291
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:05,120
is the instead of what is the smallest

1292
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:08,080
we think about what is the largest of

1293
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:11,360
these numbers but that's the first one

1294
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:14,400
right and there are again just like

1295
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:18,880
before there are two n many of them. So

1296
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:22,800
this thing here is lesser equal to s2 n

1297
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:25,199
minus one. Sorry. Yeah, like this. And

1298
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:27,760
then there are two n many they're all

1299
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:30,000
non negative. And this is and the first

1300
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:34,080
one is the largest.

1301
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:38,480
So 1 / 2 n

1302
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:41,679
squared like this, right?

1303
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:45,840
And so you see that this thing here is

1304
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:47,760
so now we can fill in the assumption. We

1305
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:50,560
were assuming that this here was less

1306
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:53,360
than this.

1307
01:15:50,560 --> 01:16:02,520
So this is the sum from

1308
01:15:53,360 --> 01:16:02,520
i =0 to n -1 of 12 to the power i

1309
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:11,760
and uh the this thing here but the

1310
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:14,880
square kills that one and you're still

1311
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:18,000
left with one over 2n

1312
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:21,840
but you see this is of course exactly

1313
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:28,719
the next one in the series. So this is I

1314
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:31,840
= 0 to N of a half to the power I like

1315
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:34,640
that right and that's indeed this is

1316
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,320
like the induction step right this is

1317
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:39,520
what's called the induction step so this

1318
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:42,400
is so it's true also so if it's true for

1319
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:45,719
n the claim then it's also true for n

1320
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:45,719
plus one

1321
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:54,800
Okay.

1322
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:56,239
So now uh so now um let me I have just

1323
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,360
four minutes left. There's a little bit

1324
01:16:56,239 --> 01:17:04,000
more uh in I already posted the lecture

1325
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:07,760
notes uh and um and there's a bit more

1326
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,360
here I want to talk about.

1327
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,480
So I want to talk about some of the

1328
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:18,040
tests but we we'll talk about that more

1329
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:18,040
next time also. So to determine

1330
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,520
whether another series

1331
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:32,800
a series is converging

1332
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:35,600
converge

1333
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:39,719
uh then

1334
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,719
there are a number of tests

1335
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:49,040
and then of the the key

1336
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:53,120
uh the key point is to use the right

1337
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:54,800
test. So uh I will just talk about so I

1338
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:56,880
just mentioned some of the tests but we

1339
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,440
won't anyway go through all of them you

1340
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:03,880
know so maybe I can't go through any of

1341
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:03,880
them. So there's a comparison test,

1342
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:09,560
there's a ratio test,

1343
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,199
there's root test,

1344
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:20,920
and there's also the one I talked about

1345
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,920
several times, the integral test.

1346
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:27,400
And then there's even one called the

1347
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:27,400
alternate series test.

1348
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:36,880
[Applause]

1349
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:39,840
Okay, now maybe I can just talk about

1350
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:43,560
the the comparison test. That's in a way

1351
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,560
the simplest of.

1352
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:50,880
And so the comparison test is

1353
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:55,080
that you're looking at two series. So

1354
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:55,080
you have these two series here

1355
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:59,560
and you have this other series here.

1356
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:10,400
And the comparison tests say that if you

1357
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:17,239
have a n bigger equal to zero less or

1358
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:17,239
equal to bn. So if you have this and

1359
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:25,400
and the B and this series here

1360
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,400
converge

1361
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:32,640
then then the corresponding thing with

1362
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:36,360
the A in

1363
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,360
will also converge.

1364
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:46,560
and and this this this is the simplest

1365
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:50,400
version of the comparison test and this

1366
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:53,520
is in a way used in two ways right so

1367
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:56,640
you often you have a series and maybe it

1368
01:19:53,520 --> 01:20:00,000
could be a super complicated series

1369
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:02,960
and uh but you see some kind of path in

1370
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,520
and so you can compare it with a much

1371
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:08,320
simpler series that perhaps you already

1372
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:11,040
know whether it's converging right and

1373
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:14,080
so if you can compare it with something

1374
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:17,199
else and you know that that converge

1375
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:19,840
then you conclude that that that a end

1376
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:22,400
series is converging. It's also

1377
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:24,320
sometimes used that you want to

1378
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:27,679
determine whether this series here is

1379
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,600
converging but you can you actually you

1380
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:31,760
can easily kind of compare it with some

1381
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:33,760
other series where you have this

1382
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:36,719
relationship here and this one you

1383
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:39,600
already know is divergent right so it's

1384
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:42,159
used in both ways when it's used to both

1385
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,000
determine that a series is convergent

1386
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:46,560
and it's also used to determine that the

1387
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:49,600
series is divergent okay so there's a

1388
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:52,480
little bit more about test on the in the

1389
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,480
lecture notes. Um but we will anyway

1390
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,080
talk about it more next time. Yeah.

1391
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:59,320
>> Question about like the intuition of

1392
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:59,320
this like

1393
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:04,800
>> Yeah.

1394
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:07,120
Right. Right. Right. So so so that's

1395
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:09,040
right. So

1396
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:11,840
so so

1397
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:16,080
right. So that's so that sort of thing

1398
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:19,679
is I mean this last one show you that

1399
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:22,320
the geometric series is one that is that

1400
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:27,040
sort of come up often as a kind of

1401
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:28,640
comparison in a way when how you get it

1402
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,880
different for different people obviously

1403
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:32,960
you don't start with a claim you sort of

1404
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:35,920
looking at the first few things and you

1405
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:38,080
see a pattern basically but it's not I

1406
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:41,360
mean you know this is not the way you

1407
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:43,840
want to really you know later on you

1408
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:46,640
know I would never prove any kind of

1409
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:51,360
convergence like this you know there's a

1410
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:53,840
a there's a way of comparing it with the

1411
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:55,920
so the idea is let me just tell you but

1412
01:21:53,840 --> 01:22:00,560
of course the lecture is over but but

1413
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:03,040
there is um so the integral test is that

1414
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:05,199
you're looking at so you're looking at a

1415
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:08,080
series and if you have a series of non-

1416
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:12,960
negative numbers you can think about

1417
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:15,600
that the series is like the area below.

1418
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:19,679
If this here is if this is think about

1419
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:23,040
this here as a1 and this is maybe a2

1420
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:26,159
then you can think about the sum as the

1421
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:28,239
sum of the areas like this and so the

1422
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:32,000
integral of test is that you comparing

1423
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:34,639
it with some curve and the area that

1424
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,800
lies below it then it's like much more

1425
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:38,800
clear right the other one is like where

1426
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,880
you have to do it case by case right

1427
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:44,960
that's not you know here there's a kind

1428
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:46,880
of general idea So it's nice in this

1429
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,159
particular case. I'm not sure it's you

1430
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,920
know what I mean. I mean you had to look

1431
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:52,000
at the first few things and see if you

1432
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,760
see a pattern, right? And of course you

1433
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,679
don't start with a claim, right? That's

1434
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,000
like the end. When you when you actually

1435
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:01,480
have a claim, then you already know

1436
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,480
what's going on.
