1
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,920
And this network could be all sorts of

2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,240
things. I mean it could be

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,240
pipes,

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,240
roads,

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,760
um,

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,760
you know, electronic communications.

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,040
And

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,040
each edge has a capacity.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,559
And the question is how much

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,280
um whatever can you get

11
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,840
get from a source to a sync.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So here we have an example.

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,240
This is a network.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,280
This six says that only six units of

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,640
flow can pass over this edge at any

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,799
given time. This says four. This is

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,520
three. And the question is how many

18
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:42,880
units of flow can you get from S to T?

19
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,320
And we will call the source S and the

20
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,000
sync T. And these are the standard

21
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,079
letters that are used for them. I don't

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
know whether they stand for anything or

23
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,759
not. I mean clearly source S presumably

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,040
stands for source but I don't know why T

25
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,920
is a sync. Okay.

26
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,200
So the question is how much flow can you

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,200
get from here to here?

28
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,640
Um,

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,080
well,

30
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,959
let's try putting flow from here to

31
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,520
here. Does anybody see a path you could

32
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,520
run flow on?

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,680
Okay, this is an easy question. What is

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,239
some path from S to T?

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's say S2

36
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:43,440
um oh my I have left out the

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,400
numbers on the nodes. So this is four

38
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:51,760
and this is five.

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,680
So S to two to four to T you could run

40
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,840
three units of flow along this path. So

41
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,519
let's put them there.

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,120
Now are there other paths you could

43
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,360
take?

44
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,239
Yeah, of course there are. You could run

45
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,560
two units of flow from here to here. So

46
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,560
that's two

47
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,280
to two two.

48
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,680
And

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,280
is this all? Well, no, because you could

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,280
run two units of flow from here

51
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,080
to here

52
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,920
to here. And we have, you know, two

53
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,840
units of flow already on here. So this

54
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,000
gives you four. You have zero units of

55
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,840
flow already. So this is two. You have

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,879
three units of flow here. So that gives

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,480
you five.

58
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,720
Now

59
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,080
is that the maximum?

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,080
Does anybody see any more paths?

61
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,640
>> Yes.

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:04,640
One from S. Two, three, five. Is it?

63
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,120
>> Yeah, you could do one from here.

64
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,760
Wait.

65
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,920
Oh, you're right. This was four. No,

66
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,519
wait. Yeah, this was four. But you could

67
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:20,479
run one up here. Four. You could run one

68
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:25,520
down here. One. And three.

69
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:27,280
And one up here. And one up here. And

70
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,720
there's still one more path you could

71
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:35,919
do, which I guess is one here, one here,

72
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,840
um, one here, one here, and one here. So

73
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,080
that's pretty complicated, but this

74
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:45,840
would be five, and this would be two,

75
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,240
and this would be three,

76
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,360
and two.

77
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,680
No, wait. And you could one run one run

78
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,199
here from four to three. So that's

79
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,120
there. And now we have a flow

80
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,040
every

81
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,800
the flow through every edge is less than

82
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:09,639
the capacity on that edge. So that's

83
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,639
good. And we have got a nine units of um

84
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,400
nine units of flow from here to here.

85
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay. I guess I copied down the um

86
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,440
No, I didn't copy anything wrong. I'm

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,880
just looking at the green numbers rather

88
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:34,360
than the blue numbers. Okay. So, here is

89
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,360
um a flow of nine units.

90
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,280
So, what we're going to do later is

91
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,960
write down a linear program and the

92
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,759
solution to this linear program will be

93
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,039
the maximum flow. But first, I want to

94
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,639
talk about a cuts. So,

95
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,639
how could you prove

96
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,160
How can you prove that this flow is

97
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,160
maximum?

98
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:24,000
>> [clears throat]

99
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,440
>> Well, let's look at these three edges.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,479
This one, this one, and that one.

101
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,960
There's four units of

102
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,039
capacity

103
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,280
on this edge, two units of capacity on

104
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,759
this edge, and three units of capacity

105
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:45,840
on that edge.

106
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:49,199
And so this defines a cut and

107
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,919
at most nine units of flow can cross

108
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,880
this cut. So that shows that nine units

109
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,880
of flow is maximum

110
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,360
cuts.

111
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,199
A cut is defined

112
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,800
as a subset of the vertices or subset

113
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,759
containing S but not T.

114
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,520
And so to make this a subset of the

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,400
vertices,

116
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,160
gosh,

117
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,199
what we do is we make the subset this

118
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,199
guy and this guy.

119
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,199
And

120
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,199
um maybe we should call it C.

121
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,120
Edges

122
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,440
from

123
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:09,240
C to C bar

124
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,240
are edges in the cut.

125
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:21,639
And let's say the capacity of an edge is

126
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,639
U of the edge.

127
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,720
So summation over E

128
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:36,680
equals I J I in C J and C bar

129
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:45,719
U of I J equals

130
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,719
I guess the value of cut

131
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,920
and it should be fairly easy that the

132
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,600
maximum flow

133
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,480
is less than or equal to the minimum cut

134
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,880
because if you have a flow from S to T

135
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,120
it must cross

136
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:12,800
every edge of the cut. So if the flow is

137
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,880
9 units then or rather if the cut is 9

138
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,800
units then

139
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,800
you can't have a flow larger than 9

140
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,800
units

141
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,320
and the theorem we will prove later

142
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:30,200
later theorem

143
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,200
the value of max flow

144
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,640
equals value

145
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,640
of minimum cut.

146
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:46,320
So you probably recognize this as being

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,800
somewhat

148
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:56,279
you know something like LP duality and

149
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,279
this is the primal solution

150
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,720
of LP and this will turn out to be the

151
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,360
solution

152
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:15,720
of the dual LP. P

153
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,720
and by the strong duality theorem of

154
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,120
linear program this guy equals this guy.

155
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,640
So the maximum flow equals the minimum

156
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,079
cut.

157
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,600
Okay. So there's a bunch of things we

158
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:35,640
have to do before we prove this theorem.

159
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,640
So what do we do?

160
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,480
First thing we do is write down the

161
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,480
linear program.

162
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,680
Does anybody have suggestions for what

163
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,680
the variables should be?

164
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,920
Yeah,

165
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,800
>> I guess it's like how like how many

166
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,600
units you like flow through each

167
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,480
>> through each edge. Exactly. So the

168
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:26,320
variables are going to be

169
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:29,720
x subig j that's the flow over edge

170
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,720
i j.

171
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,560
And

172
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,560
any suggestions for constraints?

173
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,720
>> Yeah. for any node not equal to SRT like

174
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,279
maybe the flow inwards is the flow

175
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,320
outwards

176
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,640
>> right so flow conservation I guess you

177
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,640
could call it

178
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:02,519
and let me write this down

179
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,519
um

180
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Okay.

181
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,440
Okay. Summation.

182
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:26,880
Hope I'm getting this.

183
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:29,519
J such that I J is in the set of edges.

184
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,160
X subj.

185
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,320
So this is a set of things going into

186
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:41,120
node I

187
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:45,079
and a set of things going out of node I

188
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,079
equals um

189
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,440
no wait this is a set of things going

190
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,480
out of node I J and the set of things

191
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,399
going into node I and let's put a minus

192
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,639
sign here

193
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:03,920
so that

194
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:07,279
um K such that K I is an A. So this is a

195
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,399
set of things going into node I X sub K

196
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,279
I equals zero

197
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,320
because you know linear programs it's

198
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,160
nice to write down. So you have the

199
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,240
variables on the left side of the

200
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,839
equations and are inequalities and the

201
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,680
constants on the right side of the

202
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,279
inequalities.

203
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:34,800
And there's another set of constraints.

204
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:37,279
Can anybody figure out what it is? Yep.

205
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,680
>> What?

206
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,959
>> Yes.

207
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,800
>> The capacities.

208
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,920
>> Yeah, the capacities. We need to use the

209
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,279
capacities somewhere. And the you know

210
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,200
Xig is less than or equal to

211
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:53,680
um we call them U of J.

212
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,639
Okay J. and also

213
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,120
x i j have better than greater than

214
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:03,040
equal to zero.

215
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,720
And what do we want to maximize?

216
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:10,639
Okay, so what we want to do is we want

217
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:13,279
to maximize the sum of the things into

218
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,880
the

219
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,519
sync

220
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,959
which is node t. But actually we're

221
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,480
going to do this a slightly different

222
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:25,040
way. We're going to write down a

223
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,440
different um a new constraint summation.

224
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,760
Um,

225
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:35,320
oh, let's write down for all I and I

226
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,320
want to write down

227
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,360
um

228
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,360
K such that

229
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,360
KT

230
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,800
X sub KT

231
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:56,399
is an A. So this is all the things

232
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:00,240
going into the sync.

233
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:05,880
X sub KT is equal to

234
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,880
Z and we want to maximize Z.

235
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,199
So let's

236
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:16,199
did not leave enough room. So maximize

237
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,199
see.

238
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,959
Okay.

239
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,440
So that is the um

240
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,760
linear program

241
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,199
and

242
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:55,279
I have this sneaking suspicion that I

243
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:58,560
messed up a sign somewhere but

244
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,560
it doesn't really I mean doesn't ma I

245
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,399
mean this is a pro linear program which

246
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,079
does get the solution so it doesn't

247
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,160
really matter if I messed up a sign

248
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,880
except then when we take the duel it's

249
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:15,720
going to be

250
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,720
it's not going to be quite as nice.

251
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,360
Okay, let's just keep on going and write

252
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,079
down the duel. And if I got the sign

253
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,160
wrong, we'll fix it after that.

254
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,160
I want to say sign I don't I'm going to

255
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,600
say the sign is not wrong. This is a

256
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,600
perfectly good linear program for

257
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,959
max flow.

258
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,120
It's just I am, you know, a little

259
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,759
worried that when we take the duel,

260
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,199
we're going to have to flip some signs.

261
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,086
Okay.

262
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,679
So

263
00:17:05,086 --> 00:17:08,720
[clears throat]

264
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:14,360
why don't I explain why don't I take the

265
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,360
duel now to take duel

266
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,959
each

267
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,160
equation

268
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,799
gives a constraint

269
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,520
or each inequality

270
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,520
no each variable gives a constraint each

271
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,520
constraint

272
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,720
gives a variable

273
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,320
So, we have two classes.

274
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,880
Well, actually, I guess we have three

275
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,880
classes of

276
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,240
equations and inequalities, but I just

277
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,000
want to um

278
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,679
use two of them. I'm going to call this

279
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,559
one alpha subj

280
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,720
and this one beta subi and this one beta

281
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:05,200
subc.

282
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,160
because this really is a lot like this

283
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,960
except um slightly different. And I

284
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,960
really should make this minus Z equals

285
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Z.

286
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,320
Okay.

287
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,919
So, how do we

288
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,799
get the um

289
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:37,039
variables of the

290
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:39,440
how do we get the constraints of the

291
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,600
duel and the objective function of the

292
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,880
duel? Well, the objection function in

293
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,880
the duel is just the right hand sides of

294
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,880
the

295
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,280
right hand sides of the constraints of

296
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,280
the primal.

297
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,360
So the

298
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,679
so we will have minimum

299
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,120
Because the original L primal LP was a

300
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,720
maximization. We want to have a

301
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,039
minimization.

302
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:26,039
And the minimization

303
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:26,039
summation alpha J u of I J

304
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,799
subject two.

305
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,720
Um

306
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:39,919
okay, we're going to have a equation for

307
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:44,960
each variable.

308
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:48,400
So let's say the equation

309
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,919
corresponding to variable x subig j it's

310
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:55,679
just you look at all the places where

311
00:19:51,919 --> 00:20:04,200
xig j appears in equation. So x subj

312
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:04,200
appears in beta subi and in alpha subj.

313
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:19,000
And we should have alpha iig j

314
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,000
plus beta subi minus beta subj

315
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:27,520
is greater than or equal to zero.

316
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,000
So it's greater than equal to because

317
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,679
these were positive variables. And when

318
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,760
we go from a maximization to a

319
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,080
minimization,

320
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,760
you're minimizing this. You want a

321
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,159
greater than equal to sign in your

322
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,799
constraints.

323
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,799
Okay.

324
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,799
Now

325
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,400
there is one more

326
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,400
um

327
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,960
well I guess Z was also a variable in

328
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,960
this

329
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,960
and

330
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,159
um

331
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,159
so there's an equa equing

332
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,960
to B and Z appears in the objective

333
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,679
function. So this should be greater than

334
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:24,000
or equal to one and Z also appears

335
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,159
in

336
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,640
um

337
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,720
well I just want to say only appears in

338
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:36,480
one equation that's beta subz. So beta

339
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,280
subz is greater or equal to one. No,

340
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,280
actually it appears in

341
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,280
um

342
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,679
Yeah.

343
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:08,280
Yeah. So this is the

344
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,280
duel.

345
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,960
>> What

346
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,480
>> not negative one?

347
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,480
Ah

348
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,480
because

349
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,520
I should have written this equation

350
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,679
minus and plus.

351
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,640
And now this left hand side is things

352
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:39,039
leading into

353
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:41,440
oh this is beta subt beta sub z I'm

354
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:45,039
sorry that was a very good question beta

355
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,360
subt and this thing

356
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,919
is

357
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,919
um

358
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,919
k

359
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,760
this should the

360
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:06,000
edges leading into T. And if we look

361
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,720
down here, edges leading into I have a

362
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,799
minus sign. So to make it consistent,

363
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,799
this has to have a minus sign. And then

364
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:17,039
this is a plus sign and

365
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,919
we

366
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,240
have beta subt greater than or equal to

367
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,480
one. That was a very good question and

368
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,799
that explains why I was worried about

369
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,799
the signs.

370
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,799
Good.

371
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,039
Okay.

372
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,799
So, what do solutions of this equation

373
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,799
look like?

374
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Well,

375
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:02,159
how do you get cuts out of solutions to

376
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:05,159
this equation? Okay, and this is uh very

377
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,159
um

378
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:30,200
This is a rather tricky um thing.

379
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,200
So,

380
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:37,360
so for this we have

381
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,559
um

382
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,919
we put

383
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:48,520
we put um

384
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,520
numbers on the

385
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:57,360
nodes of this network.

386
00:24:53,279 --> 00:25:00,880
And we want to maximize

387
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:06,240
alpha subj times the capacity

388
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:08,320
and subject to the capacity

389
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,240
beta i minus beta j is greater than

390
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,400
equal to zero.

391
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,880
And first I want to say you know

392
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,880
for optimal

393
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:28,240
alpha subig is equal to

394
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:32,279
well

395
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,279
either alphaig j

396
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:39,360
oh did I write forget to write down

397
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:42,400
alpha j bigger than equal to zero

398
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,120
because alpha subi j

399
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,120
was

400
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,120
uh

401
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,840
less an inequality in the

402
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,840
um

403
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,600
okay

404
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,159
the

405
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,080
constraint corresponding to al alpha i j

406
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,600
was an inequality so alpha j is greater

407
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:15,320
than equal to zero

408
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,320
and the beta sub i's are unconstrained.

409
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,240
For the optimal, well, you want to make

410
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,400
alpha subj as small as possible

411
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,520
subject to the constraints that alpha

412
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:33,360
subig is bigger equal to zero and alpha

413
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,960
sub j is bigger than beta j minus beta

414
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:41,840
i. So you might make alpha J equals

415
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:44,320
maximum of zero and beta J minus beta

416
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,720
subi

417
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,720
and the optimal.

418
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,120
Okay.

419
00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:00,240
So we're going to put

420
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:04,159
values on the nodes and we're going to

421
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:09,799
make alpha subj for maximum zero and

422
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,799
beta j minus beta i. Now suppose

423
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,559
each

424
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:22,720
alpha j equals z or 1.

425
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:24,640
And now what we have is we have

426
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,919
and

427
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,919
I'm just going to say here

428
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,279
because we want to make everything as

429
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,919
small as possible. We'll take beta

430
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:39,440
subtal 1 and we'll take beta subs equals

431
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,440
zero

432
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,440
because

433
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:52,039
you know because if there is no

434
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,039
because if s

435
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:02,080
if s is one of these

436
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,440
if we're looking at i j where i equals s

437
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,279
for this then really we don't have a

438
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,080
beta sub i and the you know

439
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,360
the equations alpha i subj minus beta j

440
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,120
is greater than equal to zero but you

441
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,320
can just make everything uniform by

442
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:22,760
setting beta s equals z. So we have beta

443
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,760
t equal 1 beta s equals z.

444
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,919
So we have 0 0. Okay, I should put some

445
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:41,120
this is one

446
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:44,120
let's make this one this zero

447
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,120
etc.

448
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:49,360
So alpha subi j is the maximum of zero

449
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,760
and beta j minus beta subi. So that

450
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,640
means that this is going to be one. This

451
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,320
is going to be zero. This is going to be

452
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,080
one.

453
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,080
Um

454
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,840
this

455
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,679
is you know this would be minus one

456
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,600
except that's less than zero. So this

457
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:12,159
had better be zero. This is zero. This

458
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,840
is zero for the same reason. This is

459
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,960
one.

460
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,960
This is um

461
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,640
one and this is zero.

462
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,799
The one edges

463
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,720
are a cut

464
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,960
because the one edges are just the edges

465
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,120
leading out of the things nodes with

466
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,559
alpha

467
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,279
nodes with beta i equals z and to the

468
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,720
nodes beta i equals 1 which was our

469
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:57,240
definition of cut.

470
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,240
So that means that this is a cut between

471
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:08,559
um which nodes are zeros

472
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,559
between the green nodes and the other

473
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,559
nodes.

474
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:18,080
So there's one here,

475
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:21,840
one one here, and one here.

476
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,000
So when you add up the

477
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,600
you look at the

478
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,679
objective function, it's just the sum

479
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,200
over all of the

480
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,960
edges

481
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,039
in the cut times their capacity

482
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,200
or one for all the edges in the cut

483
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,919
times their capacity. So it's just the

484
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,919
value of the cut.

485
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,679
So this is

486
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,799
dual

487
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,799
objective function

488
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,240
value

489
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,039
of cut

490
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,600
if

491
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:14,559
beta subi is in 01.

492
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:20,480
Now here comes the trickiest part. of

493
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:24,240
this whole um thing. Why can we assume

494
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:27,120
it's the minimum cut rather than

495
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:31,679
this? In other words, why can we assume

496
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,760
that the optimal solution of the duel

497
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:38,600
has integer values rather than

498
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,600
fractional values for the variables?

499
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,080
look

500
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,080
at.

501
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,720
Okay, we're going to look at this graph

502
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,320
in another way. Graph

503
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,640
above

504
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,600
drawn

505
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,600
in another way.

506
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,760
Okay, so let's put

507
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,480
S

508
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:18,320
beta subs=0 on the left side

509
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,840
beta subt = 1 on the right side and

510
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,399
um

511
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,799
beta sub 2

512
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,799
beta sub3

513
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,240
beta sub 4 beta sub5 But

514
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,360
um

515
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,200
I want to claim I want to

516
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:47,440
I want to say that there's no reason

517
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:52,000
these beta eyes have to be in order. put

518
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:55,120
beta i's online

519
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,360
at value

520
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,360
of beta i in the optimal solution of the

521
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,360
duel.

522
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:06,159
[clears throat]

523
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,080
So if beta was 2 was equal to 2 in the

524
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,120
optimum solution of the duel this point

525
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,679
would be 0 2.

526
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,559
And now let's look at the edges in this

527
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,039
graph. And

528
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,120
this is

529
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,600
um

530
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,679
six.

531
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,760
This is

532
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,720
four.

533
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,720
This is two.

534
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,679
Um there's an edge three, a value three

535
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,679
going from

536
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,240
Beta 3, beta 2 to beta 4. So this is

537
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,600
three.

538
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:55,039
There's an edge from beta 3 to beta 4.

539
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,039
So that is three.

540
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,039
Um,

541
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:04,240
there's an edge from beta 4 to beta 5.

542
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,440
Wait,

543
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:11,760
there's an edge from beta 5 to beta 4,

544
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:15,119
which is this way. Two.

545
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,679
There's an edge from beta 4 to t. So

546
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,679
this is eight.

547
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,839
And this is two.

548
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Um,

549
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,560
okay.

550
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,040
So,

551
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Um,

552
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,119
so the claim

553
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,000
edges

554
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,880
crossing

555
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,880
a vertical I

556
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,960
form a cut.

557
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,240
So let's look at this edge.

558
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,520
Um

559
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,119
this vertical line this has edge two,

560
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,800
three and four crossing in it. And we

561
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,000
have beta's

562
00:35:52,800 --> 00:36:01,400
Beta 1 and beta beta S and beta 2 are on

563
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,400
the left side. So that is just

564
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,359
this cut.

565
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,200
You have S and two on the left side of

566
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,640
the cut and all the other edges on the

567
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,599
right side of the cut. And we have four

568
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,079
and two and three crossing them. Now

569
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,720
let's try another cut.

570
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,720
And um I probably should use a different

571
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,720
color.

572
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,400
So

573
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,800
um

574
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,119
let's try

575
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,119
this cut.

576
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,560
Now we have five and t on the right side

577
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,480
and the other four edges on the left. So

578
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,720
what cut does that correspond to

579
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,880
here?

580
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:54,200
Um it's not a different color.

581
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,200
I'm sorry.

582
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,119
Let's try

583
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,119
making it purple.

584
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:08,839
Okay. So that

585
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,839
and I see I have drawn

586
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,720
drawn things wrong.

587
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:21,680
I left out a edge because there's an

588
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:24,640
edge from B3 to B5. So that should look

589
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,599
like this

590
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:31,880
because we have three going to five and

591
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,880
that edge had capacity four.

592
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:50,160
So the value of this cut is two.

593
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:54,480
No, wait. It's four + 8.

594
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:56,320
That's 12. And we don't count this two

595
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,440
edge two because it crosses the cut

596
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,960
backwards. And we only count edges that

597
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:08,000
cross the cut forwards. And

598
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:12,520
you know here we have

599
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,520
that cut is um

600
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,720
okay I need a purple line here. purple

601
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,720
line here.

602
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,839
No, those are the wrong

603
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,800
I'm sorry about that.

604
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,240
This is the So five and t are on the one

605
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,200
side of this cut. So we this this and

606
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,640
this edge is not cross the cut because

607
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,440
it crosses the cut backwards. So the

608
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,440
value of that cut

609
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,440
is

610
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,920
no.

611
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,520
So these edges are these vertices are in

612
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,680
the cut. So the edges are the ones that

613
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,359
go from something not in the cut to

614
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,960
something in the cut. So that's four to

615
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,119
t

616
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,280
3 to 5

617
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:24,880
and 5 to 4 is backwards edge. So the

618
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:26,640
value of that cut is 8 + 3 which is 11

619
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,640
which is bigger than nine. So it's not

620
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,640
the minimum cut but that it

621
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,880
I think the B beta 3 to beta 5 might

622
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,760
have the wrong value.

623
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,040
>> I think you're right. So beta 3 to beta

624
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:56,200
5 is four

625
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,200
and I put down three on here.

626
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:08,800
So let's see beta 3 to beta 5 three. So

627
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:11,800
this is supposed to be a three. Thank

628
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,800
you.

629
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:25,839
Okay. So that is um so we have a cut of

630
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:31,119
value 11

631
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:34,920
for there. So these are cuts.

632
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,920
Now I want to claim

633
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,320
The value of the dual optimum

634
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,960
in duel.

635
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:04,040
Well, I want to label these cuts. So,

636
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,040
let's label this one as

637
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Um,

638
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,440
okay.

639
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,400
C1,

640
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,040
C2,

641
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,040
C3, C4,

642
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,040
C5.

643
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,800
And let's assume

644
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:36,480
that the betas are put down in order

645
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:42,560
because we can always renumber the

646
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:46,160
um variables so that the third variable

647
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:49,599
is the one right after the second cut.

648
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:53,960
So the value of the optimum in the dual

649
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,960
is equal to summation

650
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,160
well

651
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,160
summation

652
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:09,280
alpha subig j u of i j which is equal to

653
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:15,720
summation

654
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,720
beta j minus beta j minus one

655
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,079
um

656
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
times

657
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,760
C sub

658
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,760
J minus one.

659
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:39,800
Why is that?

660
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,800
Well, let's look at this picture again.

661
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,920
So

662
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:57,359
we have alpha i subj equals maximum of

663
00:42:52,800 --> 00:43:00,359
zero and beta j minus beta subi.

664
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:00,359
So,

665
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,480
so this is equal to summation over

666
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,480
forward

667
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,480
edges

668
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:17,640
beta j minus beta i

669
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,640
u of i j.

670
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,200
Now let's look at this edge.

671
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:30,000
This edge appears in two cuts

672
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:34,880
and its value in the first cut is beta t

673
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:37,920
minus beta 5 times the value times 8.

674
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:43,839
The value of contributing the second cut

675
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:46,000
is beta 5 minus beta 4 * 8. So adding

676
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:48,800
them up

677
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,280
when you sum up all the cuts you get

678
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,920
beta t minus beta 4 * 8

679
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,079
for the value this edge contributes to

680
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,079
the duel

681
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,440
which is

682
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,440
exactly what it's supposed to be.

683
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:19,960
Okay. So this is the trickiest part. So

684
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,960
should I explain it some more?

685
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,560
Um

686
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:37,200
so beta five. So

687
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:40,160
the cuts only come from the edges where

688
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,960
beta

689
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,560
where beta 5 is bigger than beta 4. So

690
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,200
this edge does not contribute anything

691
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:50,000
to the cut. If there's a cut that goes

692
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:54,880
if there's an edge that goes forward, it

693
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:58,800
contributes beta t minus beta 5 * 8 to

694
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:01,040
this cut and beta 5 minus beta 4 * 8 to

695
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:07,359
this cut. And adding those two things

696
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:10,480
up, you get beta t minus beta 4 * 8

697
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:14,880
to the total objective function of the

698
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:17,839
duel, which is just

699
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:22,760
what it's supposed to be because alpha j

700
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:22,760
is equal to beta j minus beta i.

701
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,200
Okay. So,

702
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:52,520
oh, wait. I think I wanted to keep that.

703
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,520
So,

704
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Objective

705
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,560
function

706
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,079
of duel

707
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:43,839
is

708
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:48,520
summation beta j minus beta j minus one

709
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:48,520
c subj j minus one

710
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:53,760
right

711
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,520
but

712
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,280
summation

713
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:04,160
beta j minus beta j minus one is equal

714
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:09,240
to beta t minus beta s is equal to

715
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,240
because beta t was one, beta s was zero.

716
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:17,680
Let beta j minus beta j minus one equals

717
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:21,280
lambda j.

718
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:24,480
So this equals summation lambda j c j

719
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:27,359
minus one.

720
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,560
Okay, maybe lambda j minus one lambda j

721
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:32,960
minus one c a minus one

722
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:38,440
where

723
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,440
summation lambda j - 1 = 1.

724
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,520
This

725
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,520
is an average

726
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,119
of

727
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,599
values

728
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,599
of cuts

729
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,720
just by the definition of average. But

730
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,560
the average of a bunch of things is

731
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,800
bigger than the minimum of the bunch of

732
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:10,599
things. So this is greater than or equal

733
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,599
to the minimum

734
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,560
cut.

735
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:19,040
And in the optimal solution of the duel,

736
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,640
you take the minimum cut. You can put

737
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,720
zeros

738
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:25,359
on the beta subjs that are to the left

739
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,440
of the cut and one on the beta js to the

740
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,440
right of the cut. So you get the minimum

741
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:34,040
value of the cut for the solution of the

742
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,040
duel. So the

743
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:43,040
value of the dual substitution

744
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:45,520
is equal to the minimum cut

745
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:49,920
and we know that the value of the primal

746
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:52,240
solution is equal to the maximum flow

747
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,800
because that's the way we set up the LP.

748
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:58,280
So the maximum flow is equal to the

749
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,280
minimum cut.

750
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,800
Okay.

751
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,800
And

752
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:10,720
so the next thing I want to do, which

753
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,319
I'm

754
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,280
I don't think I'm going to quite get

755
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:18,720
through all the lecture notes today, but

756
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,040
what I've done today is the so far is

757
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,200
the thing that I really want you to

758
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:26,720
take, you know, the lesson I want you to

759
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:29,359
take home that looking at the DS and

760
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,240
analyzing them can give you very

761
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:34,800
interesting theorems about

762
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:37,680
um linear programs

763
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:42,079
and this is

764
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:45,040
no I want to say this is a

765
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:49,680
fundamental principle in combinatorial

766
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:52,480
optimization and um if you actually get

767
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,839
a linear program from somewhere

768
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,000
one of the first things you do is you

769
00:49:53,839 --> 00:50:01,040
look at the duel you stare at it and you

770
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:03,839
say what does this mean in terms of the

771
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,359
actual problem you're studying. And

772
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,880
often

773
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:09,520
it will give you some insight into the

774
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:12,379
problem. Sometimes it won't. Sometimes

775
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,520
it just looks like a bunch of,

776
00:50:12,379 --> 00:50:17,760
[laughter]

777
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:19,520
you know, a bunch of um

778
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,520
variables that you can't understand at

779
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,520
all.

780
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,119
Okay.

781
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,119
So,

782
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:41,480
um, I think we can erase this now.

783
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,319
Suppose

784
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:09,319
you have a

785
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:09,319
you have a maximum flow problem

786
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,000
with integer capacities.

787
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:36,040
Then

788
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,040
the solution is an integer

789
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,119
proof.

790
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,559
The dual solution

791
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,520
is a cut.

792
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,960
So it's

793
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,960
a sum

794
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,960
of

795
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,319
integers

796
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,839
because the capacity of the cut is the

797
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:13,200
sum of the capacities of the edges and

798
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:18,680
the capacities of the edges are

799
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,680
integers. So we can ask the question

800
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:28,359
does the primal

801
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,359
solution

802
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,760
also

803
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,720
have

804
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,720
I guess integer flows.

805
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:50,880
because maybe it doesn't. I mean, there

806
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,160
are certainly solutions where it

807
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,160
doesn't. I mean,

808
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,319
um,

809
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:05,280
you can imagine coming up with a

810
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:08,079
solution where you have, I guess, six

811
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,880
and a half units of flow flowing over

812
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:14,800
this edge and one and a half units

813
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:17,680
flowing over that edge. and adding up to

814
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:21,160
nine. So I guess I can't do arithmetic

815
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,160
but um

816
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:28,400
but you also know that all the edges

817
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,480
all the flows going across a cut have to

818
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,559
be equal to the value of that the edges

819
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,720
in the capacities in that cut. So you

820
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,359
know some edges have to be integer. So

821
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,119
the question is do all the edges can you

822
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:41,119
find a solution with all the edges

823
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:43,920
integers

824
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:48,480
and

825
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:50,720
the answer is yes and I don't know how

826
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,599
to do it easily working from the linear

827
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,280
program. So there's another algorithm

828
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,520
for

829
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,079
integer flows

830
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,079
algorithm

831
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:05,480
for

832
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,480
max flow

833
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,920
which I'm going to call augmenting paths

834
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,920
algorithm

835
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,040
and the and the idea.

836
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:25,160
Find a path.

837
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,520
Push as much flow

838
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:37,559
over this path as possible.

839
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,480
So

840
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:57,040
as much flow over this path as possible

841
00:54:52,480 --> 00:55:00,640
will you know you will take the minimum

842
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:04,960
residual capacity in every edge

843
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:07,920
and the path and um that means that you

844
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,920
um

845
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,160
you know the residual capacity is always

846
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,440
an integer because the flows are

847
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,720
integers and the capacities are

848
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,880
integers. So that means that the whole

849
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,880
thing will be an integer. So let's try

850
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,880
this

851
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:31,559
and let's see we have a simple network.

852
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,559
Um

853
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,079
2 2 3

854
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,520
three. These are the capacities. Two

855
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:57,839
two. And let's put another edge from

856
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:59,520
here to here with capacity three.

857
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:03,400
And we're going to direct all the edges

858
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,400
to the right. So

859
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,240
good.

860
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:18,319
Okay. So the first step,

861
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:20,400
let's take the best path to

862
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:23,040
push flow from here to here. So let's

863
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,640
take three along here,

864
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:29,640
three along here, and three along here.

865
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,640
Okay.

866
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:35,920
Now, how much capacity remains

867
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:38,799
in the graph?

868
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:41,440
Well,

869
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:43,040
there's zero left in this edge, zero

870
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,720
left along this edge, and zero left

871
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:48,720
along this edge. So it looks like we

872
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:52,000
have a cut

873
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:54,400
between the left side and the right side

874
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:59,760
with

875
00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:01,839
and you can't put any more flow across.

876
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,720
But of course you should know you should

877
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:07,839
realize that you could easily put a flow

878
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:11,520
of four on the original graph.

879
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:14,960
So um

880
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:18,920
you have to be clever

881
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,920
to use this algorithm.

882
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:27,920
So

883
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:30,920
how can we push more flow across this

884
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,920
graph?

885
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,680
I want to claim that we could use this

886
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,680
path

887
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:47,839
So this path we push it two across here.

888
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,480
Push two across here. And now we're

889
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:52,160
going the wrong way in the edge. But we

890
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,040
can do that because there's already a

891
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:58,319
flow of three across this edge. And so

892
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:01,119
to get a flow of two this way, we just

893
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:05,920
reduce this three to one.

894
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:08,079
And then we can push another flow of two

895
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,160
across here and another flow of two

896
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:14,240
across here.

897
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:17,760
So you can push flow across edges

898
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:20,559
backwards as long as there's

899
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,359
uh

900
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,440
there is a flow left

901
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:28,875
as long as there is as long as there's a

902
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,720
flow already along an edge.

903
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:34,240
[clears throat] So I want to claim

904
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:37,240
define residual

905
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,240
network.

906
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,480
Um,

907
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:47,480
if an

908
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,480
edge

909
00:58:51,040 --> 00:59:01,040
has flow

910
00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:04,599
x subj less than u of j.

911
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:04,599
The new capacity

912
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:13,480
is

913
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:13,480
U of I J minus X of J.

914
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:22,079
If an edge

915
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:26,640
has flow

916
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:32,359
x subj greater than zero.

917
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:32,359
There's an edge and residual network

918
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:39,960
with

919
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:50,559
so let's call this edge ei J

920
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:53,559
E subji with

921
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,559
capacity

922
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:00,119
um

923
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,119
x subi j.

924
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:06,960
So

925
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:09,520
what is the residual network for this

926
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:12,640
graph when we put

927
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,880
the flow the orange flow across it?

928
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:18,119
Well,

929
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,119
we have

930
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:25,280
um

931
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:29,040
well this had capacity three. So now

932
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:31,200
that edge has capacity three in the

933
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:33,520
opposite direction.

934
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,720
This edge has zero. So that has capacity

935
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:40,079
zero. Two two.

936
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,839
This edge also has capacity three and

937
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:44,480
flow three in the forward. So now we get

938
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:47,119
capacity 3 going in the backwards

939
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,839
direction

940
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:51,680
and this one we have capacity three in

941
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:53,920
the backwards direction. This has

942
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:57,562
capacity three in the forwards and the

943
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,640
capacity three in the forwards.

944
01:00:57,562 --> 01:01:04,200
[clears throat]

945
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:04,200
Okay. So this is the residual network.

946
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,000
Okay.

947
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:19,680
And now you can see that there's a flow

948
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:23,839
of two that goes bum bum bum bum bum.

949
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:29,240
So we push this flow of two here and we

950
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:29,240
get here. I'm going to redraw this.

951
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:38,440
We get two, two,

952
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:49,920
and one going this way. And

953
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:52,920
three going this way. And two, two, and

954
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,920
three.

955
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:02,480
So now we have a flow from the source to

956
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:04,000
the sync with value five. And that's the

957
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:07,200
best you can do because you can see that

958
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,040
there's a cut of value five. With just

959
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:16,440
taking t and everything else, you can

960
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:16,440
get at most value five across this cut.

961
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,599
So claim

962
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:43,520
if there

963
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:47,079
is

964
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,079
no flow

965
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,240
in residual network.

966
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,559
So

967
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,359
then

968
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:14,440
there is a cut

969
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:14,440
cut in original graph.

970
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:23,119
So

971
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,200
if you have a value,

972
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:28,480
so I guess

973
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:31,440
I should have started this with

974
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:35,400
suppose

975
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,400
you have a flow

976
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,599
of

977
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:41,440
value

978
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:44,559
Z.

979
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:47,119
If there's no augmenting path in the

980
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:51,960
residual network, then there's a cut in

981
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:51,960
the original graph of value.

982
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:15,880
So if there's no flow in the if there's

983
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,880
no flow in the residual network.

984
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:38,640
Let S be

985
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:42,839
maybe C be set

986
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:42,839
of nodes you can reach

987
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:51,160
from S.

988
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,640
So let's say we have this

989
01:04:56,799 --> 01:05:01,440
thing.

990
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:03,359
So

991
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,039
what nodes can you reach from S?

992
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:07,200
Actually you can't reach any nodes from

993
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:10,559
S because

994
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:16,359
this is capacity. This is at capacity.

995
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:16,359
So we could have um

996
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,280
made this

997
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:27,359
made this capacity four and this

998
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:31,280
capacity four. And this is still a good

999
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:35,319
flow in the residual network. And now

1000
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,319
what nodes can we reach?

1001
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,400
Well,

1002
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,240
we can reach

1003
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,240
this node.

1004
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:57,079
We cannot reach this node because this

1005
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:57,079
is at capacity. we can reach this node.

1006
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,160
Oops.

1007
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,920
And

1008
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:12,960
we actually

1009
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:16,000
can reach this node

1010
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,599
because it's at capacity.

1011
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,079
But we cannot reach this node and we

1012
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:21,680
cannot reach this node. So we have a cut

1013
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:26,640
here

1014
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:29,839
and that corresponds to this cut here.

1015
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:31,599
So every

1016
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:33,839
edge

1017
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:38,200
from

1018
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:38,200
C to C bar,

1019
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:46,240
the flow is equal to U of I J because

1020
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:53,280
otherwise you could push flow from C to

1021
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:56,720
C bar and every edge from C bar to C

1022
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:59,359
X subig equals zero because Otherwise,

1023
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:02,799
you could push extra flow backwards

1024
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:05,119
along this edge.

1025
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:07,280
And that says

1026
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,960
the cut

1027
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:11,760
equals

1028
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:15,880
sum

1029
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,880
c bar

1030
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:22,520
u of i j equals flow.

1031
01:07:22,799 --> 01:07:28,319
So

1032
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:32,240
if you cannot find any augmenting paths,

1033
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:34,400
if you already have a partial flow,

1034
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:39,960
then

1035
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:39,960
you're done. You cannot get any further.

1036
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:49,039
Yeah. I mean then you have you know that

1037
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:51,280
is the value of the maximum flow because

1038
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:53,520
you have found a minimum cut that is

1039
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:56,000
equal to your flow.

1040
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:58,079
So this says that

1041
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,920
you can use the augmenting paths

1042
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,760
algorithm

1043
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:05,440
to

1044
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:08,720
find max flows and

1045
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:12,480
it will give you an integer flow if all

1046
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:16,080
the capacities are integer which is know

1047
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:19,520
what we wanted to show

1048
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:22,400
and actually there's a

1049
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,960
there's an application of this which

1050
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:28,920
maybe I'm going to get through.

1051
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,920
And this is Kunig's thurum.

1052
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,679
Oops.

1053
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,159
All right. And a bipartite graph.

1054
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:01,480
The cardality of the maximum matching

1055
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:08,359
of maximum matching

1056
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,080
equals cardality

1057
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:18,040
of minimum vertex covers.

1058
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,400
Okay,

1059
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:36,839
let's look at a graph.

1060
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:50,520
So this is a bipartite graph and um

1061
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:56,920
what would be a maximum matching?

1062
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,920
Well,

1063
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:04,159
I mean we clearly should put this vertex

1064
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,880
in the matching. This vertex in the

1065
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:10,239
matching. Um I guess we need another

1066
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,239
vertex here.

1067
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,640
Um and we can put this vertex in the

1068
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,640
matching and this vertex in the

1069
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,640
matching.

1070
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:25,400
So the maximum

1071
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,400
matching

1072
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:30,800
equals four.

1073
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:33,280
So the maximum matching is just the

1074
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:36,920
maximum set of edges such that no two

1075
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,920
share an end point.

1076
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:41,480
Minimum vertex cover

1077
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,400
set of vertices

1078
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:54,760
that touch every edge.

1079
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,000
And clearly

1080
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,480
verdicts cover

1081
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:12,040
is greater than or equal to the matching

1082
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:18,480
because there must be a vertex that

1083
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:23,320
touches one end point of each of the

1084
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:23,320
edges of the matching. And

1085
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,800
you don't I mean

1086
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:31,199
you're not going to get less than that.

1087
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,920
But Kodig theorem is that these two

1088
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:36,920
quantities are actually equal.

1089
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,920
And

1090
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,360
proof

1091
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,840
maximum flow

1092
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:58,719
then cut.

1093
01:11:53,679 --> 01:12:01,719
Okay. So we want a flow whose

1094
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,719
um

1095
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:07,760
we want a flow whose um value is equal

1096
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:13,080
to the matching. So what are we going to

1097
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:13,080
do? Well, we're going to take um

1098
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:22,640
s on the left and put an put an edge of

1099
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:28,480
weight one to every vertex in the

1100
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:31,440
matching. And now we're going to

1101
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:37,440
and let's um do the same thing on the

1102
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:39,120
right. We'll put a edge to the sink from

1103
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:41,040
every

1104
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:44,480
point on the right side of the bipartite

1105
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:46,800
graph. And then and these capacities are

1106
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:50,120
going to be one.

1107
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,120
And now

1108
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:56,040
let's see. Um

1109
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,719
there

1110
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:23,040
There is a max flow

1111
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:25,920
with

1112
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:28,920
integer

1113
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,920
values.

1114
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:37,679
And what that means is that

1115
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:39,360
oh and we can let the

1116
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:43,239
capacities of these middle edges be

1117
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:43,239
infinity if we want.

1118
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:57,440
Well, what that means is that there are

1119
01:13:53,520 --> 01:14:02,400
going to be some number of edges in the

1120
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:04,159
middle which have weight one here.

1121
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:08,000
So I want to claim that those are

1122
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:13,320
clearly a maximum matching because um

1123
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,320
you know on the right hand side

1124
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:20,560
no if they one flow if there's a one

1125
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:24,960
unit of flow from here to here then no

1126
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:28,080
other edge could use this vertex.

1127
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:31,520
So if you have a flow from here to here

1128
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:33,440
then this edge

1129
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,120
this edge is in the matching and neither

1130
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:37,600
of these edges is in the matching and

1131
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:42,880
similarly on the left. So the maximum

1132
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:44,640
flow gives you a maximum matching

1133
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,760
duel

1134
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:50,560
is a cut

1135
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:54,960
and that means that there's a cut whose

1136
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:56,320
value is equal to the maximum flow and

1137
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,520
There are going to be some edges on the

1138
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:04,239
right which are cut and the some edges

1139
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:07,239
on the left which are in the cut.

1140
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:07,239
And

1141
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:21,239
I don't think I did that right.

1142
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,239
But um

1143
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:28,560
you know if the edge is in the cut then

1144
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:32,000
this vertex is in the vertex cover and

1145
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:35,120
now we know that there aren't any other

1146
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,960
paths from S to T. And that means that

1147
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:41,120
we know that every vertex

1148
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,640
every edge is covered by at least one

1149
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,199
vertex because otherwise there would be

1150
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:48,000
a path from S to T going through that

1151
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:48,000
edge.

1152
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,320
Let me see.

1153
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,159
Um, so

1154
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:19,679
let's

1155
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:23,360
Okay, I did not prepare this quite

1156
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:26,000
properly enough. So, this is an edge in

1157
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:31,080
the cut. This, I believe, has to be an

1158
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,080
edge in the cut. And now

1159
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,679
And um

1160
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,679
I can just say this is an edge in the

1161
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:44,679
cut

1162
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,320
there should be one more thing

1163
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,239
and that means so there are three edges

1164
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,800
in this

1165
01:16:56,239 --> 01:17:02,960
cut and I think that cut actually cuts

1166
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:05,520
all the paths from left to right.

1167
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:09,360
So, we should have

1168
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:11,760
a maximum matching of only three.

1169
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:15,760
And um

1170
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:20,199
well, it's easy. One,

1171
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,199
two, three.

1172
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:26,360
And you can't get any more things in the

1173
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,360
maximum matching because

1174
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:34,719
you know because there's a cut.

1175
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:37,600
So this is Kunix theorem and I seem to

1176
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:40,719
be completely out of time. So

1177
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:43,440
I will see you next time on Thursday

1178
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:46,440
when we start a new topic on information

1179
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,440
theory.
