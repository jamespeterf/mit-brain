1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,360
Obesity is one of the most urgent health

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,480
challenges of our time affecting over

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,800
890 million people worldwide. It

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,520
dramatically increases the risk of type

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,240
2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,480
certain cancers. Despite the recent

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,359
success of incrretinbased drugs like

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,760
ompic, there remains a large unmet

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,480
clinical need. Many patients do not

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,200
respond. There may be side effects and

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,840
long-term solutions are limited. At the

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,160
center of this problem are adiposytes,

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,480
specialized cells that store fat and

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,719
regulate metabolism, the process by

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,000
which our bodies convert food into

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,320
energy.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,039
>> Most of our fat is white fat, which

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,120
stores calories for future use. When we

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,199
take in more calories than we burn,

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,120
white fat accumulates, which leads to

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,600
obesity.

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,760
In contrast, brown fat burns energy to

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,359
produce heat when we are cold. Under

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,400
certain conditions, such as cold

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,159
exposure or exercise, some white fat can

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,799
transform and take on brownlike

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,640
properties, a process called browning.

28
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,240
Triggering this shift could help the

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,720
body burn more energy and combat

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,600
obesity. But there's another side to the

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,000
story. When fat cells don't form or

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,320
differentiate properly, fat can spill

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,720
over into other tissues such as liver

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,600
and muscle. This is a dangerous process

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,439
known as ectopic fat deposition. This

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,920
contributes to metabolic diseases like

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,159
insulin resistance and lipodistrophe

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,400
where abnormal fat distribution itself

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,960
drives health problems.

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,320
In this sense, both the ability of cells

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,479
to store fat safely, the adopenic shift,

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,880
and to burn fat efficiently, the

43
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,920
thermogenic shift are crucial for

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,680
maintaining metabolic health.

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,240
Recent advances in single cell

46
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,640
transcripttoics have unexpectedly

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,200
revealed that fat cells exist in many

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,840
different states, but the factors that

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,360
determine whether they store energy or

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,440
burn it are still poorly understood. By

51
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,160
combining single cell data with gene

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,800
pertubation experiments, researchers can

53
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,840
begin to map the pathways that push fat

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,360
cells toward energy storing adipogenic

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,920
or energy burning termogenic roles. The

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,720
challenge is really scale. Thousands of

57
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,640
genes can be individually perturbed and

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,520
millions of possible multi-gene

59
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,560
combinations can be made. Far too many

60
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,560
to test one by one in the lab. That's

61
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,640
where machine learning and you can help.

62
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,040
>> The goal here is to predict how specific

63
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,440
gene perturbations influence the fate of

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,400
fat cells, whether they differentiate

65
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,200
into energy storing widerocytes or shift

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,200
toward energy expending states. By

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,840
identifying the most promising genetic

68
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,920
switches and combinations, your work

69
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,319
could accelerate the discovery of new

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,360
molecular pathways for treating obesity

71
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,519
and metabolic disease.

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,760
This is where you come in. We need

73
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,400
algorithms that can predict the effects

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,319
of single gene perturbations, predict

75
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,879
the effects of combinations of

76
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,760
perturbations, capturing how genes

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,680
interact with one another, and propose

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,680
new gene combinations that are most

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,720
likely to shift fat cells toward

80
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,400
adipogenic or termogenic states.

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,400
The top predictions will be tested in

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
the lab at the Broad Institute, meaning

83
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,319
that your algorithms could directly

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,799
guide biological discovery in obesity

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,440
research. The Eric and Wendy Schmidt

Center, and Crunch DAO are proud to host

90
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,879
the obesity machine learning competition

91
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,959
tackling metabolic diseases. This is

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,959
part of our annual series of machine

93
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,040
learning challenges that unite the

94
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,200
global community to address urgent

95
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,879
biomedical problems. The beauty of

96
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,439
machine learning challenges is the

97
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,439
collective intelligence they inspire by

98
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,840
bringing together experts with different

99
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,000
backgrounds from academia, industry, and

100
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,080
beyond. We accelerate scientific

101
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,599
progress far beyond what any single lab

102
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,400
could achieve.

103
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,880
Last year, nearly 1,000 participants

104
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,759
from over 60 countries joined our

105
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,680
autoimmune disease challenge. This year,

106
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,360
we invite you to take part in a

107
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,320
challenge that tackles one of the

108
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,520
world's fastest growing health concerns,

109
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,360
obesity and metabolic disease.

110
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,040
>> What makes this challenge unique is that

111
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,199
the winning models won't stop at

112
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,440
prediction. Top submissions will be

113
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,040
experimentally validated in the lab,

114
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,280
which means that your algorithms could

115
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,440
directly guide biological discovery,

116
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,560
opening the door to new strategies for

117
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,880
tackling obesity and metabolic disease.

118
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,120
Do you need a biology background? Not at

119
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,280
all. We'll provide a crash course in the

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,440
relevant biology along with all the data

121
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,440
sets you need. All that's missing is

122
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,600
really you and your algorithms.

123
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,199
>> The competition launches in December

124
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,840
2025. Monetary prizes will be awarded

125
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,880
and all code, data, and algorithms will

126
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,800
be made open- source for community use.

127
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,199
Our annual machine learning challenges

128
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,919
have already brought together a vibrant

129
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,320
global community of problem solvers, and

130
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,120
we hope you will be part of this next

131
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,280
breakthrough. Join us for the obesity

132
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,080

133
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,400
metabolic diseases. Your ideas could

134
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,320
help uncover new strategies to combat

135
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,039
one of the greatest health challenges of

136
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,280
our time. Visit the Eric and Wendy
