1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,199
So this is the second day of our of our

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,000
little unit on random walks on groups.

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,680
And the first day we introduced it. Um

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,439
and uh the second day we'll describe

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,720
some of some more modern stuff. And the

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,279
second day will be a little bit more of

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,399
a survey. I won't prove everything. Um

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,840
but I'll try to um uh and in the second

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,480
day we'll see how it connects to

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,360
projection theory.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,770
Okay. So first let's recall what we're

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,119
where we were talking about

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,119
[Applause]

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,159
Okay,

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,920
so we have a finite group G and then we

16
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:14,000
have a probability measure on G

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:17,200
and we have an operator T mu. T mu of F

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,600
is F convolved with mu

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,840
and so this is like a does a step of a

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,520
random walk. So if f is the probability

21
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,360
distribution at some moment then you

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,439
make a step of the random walk end and

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,119
then t muf is the new probability

24
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,680
distribution.

25
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:37,360
Okay. Um so t mu of one is one the

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,439
constant function one and t mu maps the

27
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,759
functions of mean zero. So these are

28
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,000
functions whose sum to zero or have mean

29
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:50,240
zero. It maps it to itself. Um and sigma

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,479
1 of t mu is the largest singular value

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,479
of this.

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,560
Okay. And we saw that sigma 1 of t mu is

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,560
related to the mixing behavior of this

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,840
random walk. So um we always have that

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,560
sigma 1 of t mu is less than or equal to

36
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,080
one and uh actually we don't it's a

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,160
positive number and and sigma 1 of t mu

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,480
is strictly less than one then that

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,160
gives some kind of mixing of the random

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,160
walk we made that precise last time

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:37,959
okay um next we focused on the group

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,959
SL2FP PE

43
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,480
and one one special feature of this

44
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,000
group came from representation theory.

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,480
So we had a proposition that

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,959
um if you have a representation of this

47
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,959
of this group.

48
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,840
So that's a unitary

49
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,840
representation and let's say it's

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,840
non-trivial.

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,200
Then D has to be pretty big.

52
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,680
Okay.

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,120
And we use that to prove a mixing

54
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,239
estimate. mixing estimate says that if

55
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,239
mu is a probability measure on on this

56
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,239
group

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:41,000
um then sigma 1 of t mu is bounded by p

58
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,000
^ 2 * mu l2

59
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,519
for example if a is just a sub a subset

60
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,720
of sl2 fp then there's a uniform measure

61
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,720
on a Mua

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,840
and it's straightforward to check that

63
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,879
it's L2 norm squared mu aa L2 norm 2 is

64
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,799
1 over the size of a.

65
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,680
So a corlary is that if a is

66
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:12,239
significantly bigger than p^2 then the

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,640
random walk using a mixes rapidly.

68
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,000
So correlary

69
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,000
if for instance a is bigger than p to

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,479
the 2.1

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,600
um then

72
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:31,600
then sigma 1 of ta so I'll write ta it's

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,759
an abbreviation for t mua sigma 1 of ta

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,720
would be smaller than something like p

75
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,720
to the - one10th so it would mix quite

76
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,720
rapidly

77
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,320
okay so this is this is a nice

78
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,360
proposition and it's kind of sharp of

79
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,680
its type because if the set A is a

80
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,080
subgroup of SL2FP

81
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,720
then it the random walk will not

82
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,720
generate will not mix at all and there

83
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,919
are subgroups or easy subgroups that

84
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,520
have size around P^ squ so we can't we

85
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,680
can't do better than this

86
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,360
so remark

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,080
that this corary is sharp

88
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,520
uh because there exists

89
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,520
H a proper subgroup

90
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,759
size of H around P square. So for

91
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,440
instance, H is the upper triangular

92
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,520
matrices. Yeah,

93
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,000
>> if you had for a different group a

94
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,840
similar proposition where you can lower

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,039
bound the dimension of the of a

96
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,240
non-trivial unit, could you also use

97
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,600
that as an upper bound for the sigma one

98
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,440
for that group?

99
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,360
>> Yeah. So the question is if we had an

100
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,560
analog of this proposition for some

101
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,360
other group say SLDFP

102
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,199
um then could we do this whole story for

103
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,400
for all these other groups? Yeah, you

104
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,600
could. This is that's all that we've

105
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,680
used so far.

106
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,919
Yeah. Okay, cool. Um okay. So then also

107
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,000
last class we stated an old theorem

108
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,400
which goes rather it's older than this

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,600
proposition but it goes rather it does

110
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,600
not obviously follow from it.

111
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,080
So theorem this theorem is essentially

112
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:25,039
due to Selberg um although he didn't say

113
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:29,759
it in quite this way. Um so here a so we

114
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:34,039
pick okay so a is a particular list of

115
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,039
generators of sl2fp.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
[Applause]

117
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,800
Okay. So this is perhaps the simplest

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,400
set of generators of sl2fp but is also

119
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,560
somewhat special in a way we'll talk

120
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,319
about when we talk about the proof.

121
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:56,479
Okay. So then the conclusion is that

122
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,759
sigma 1 of t a is less than 1 minus c

123
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,400
where c is positive and c is uh this is

124
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,240
true for every p. So c does not depend

125
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,160
on p.

126
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,160
So these all mix uniformly fast.

127
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,880
Okay. So this theorem is not an

128
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,080
immediate corlary of this proposition

129
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,599
because this is a much smaller set. Um

130
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,000
and uh okay so today there are a couple

131
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,759
of goals in in this survey. The first

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
goal is to sketch a proof of this

133
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,440
theorem in which this proposition plays

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,400
a key role but we'll see some other

135
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,479
ideas and a second goal is to discuss

136
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,160
what happens if you replace what was

137
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,919
special about this generating set at all

138
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,800
and what happens if we replace it by

139
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,800
some other generating set.

140
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,479
Okay.

141
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,080
Okay. Um,

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,319
cool. So, the first proof was due to

143
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,599
Selberg basically, but um, that proof

144
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,120
was quite difficult. It used the an used

145
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,720
a bunch of stuff including the remon

146
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,639
hypothesis for curves over finite

147
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,960
fields. Um, we're going to uh follow a

148
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,960
later proof

149
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,160
which is due to Sarnac and Shuer and

150
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,720
perhaps simplified or adjusted a bit by

151
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,400
by various people.

152
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,000
Okay,

153
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,080
cool.

154
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,599
Um, all right.

155
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,879
So, this set is uh symmetric, meaning

156
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,560
that uh if you if a group element is in

157
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:35,680
the set, so is the inverse. Um, and so

158
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:40,080
we could say that mu is symmetric

159
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:43,599
if mu of g is equal to mu of g inverse

160
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:47,519
for every g and g.

161
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:51,680
And um t mu actually is it's a bit nicer

162
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:55,600
if mu is symmetric. Um and here's why.

163
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,760
So remark mu is symmetric that is

164
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:03,240
equivalent to saying that the operator t

165
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,240
mu is symmetric as a matrix.

166
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,920
And so because so if you think of T mu

167
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:17,360
as a matrix then it has a g1 g2 entry

168
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,160
and the g1 g2 entry is mu of g1 g2

169
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,519
inverse. So if you switch these you're

170
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,279
taking the inverse of that and uh if mu

171
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,600
is symmetric that doesn't matter. So

172
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,360
it's a symmetric matrix.

173
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,040
Okay so that's nice because a symmetric

174
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,800
matrix you can diagonalize it and

175
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,240
instead of just having singular values

176
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,040
it has igen values. So once tu is a

177
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,800
symmetric matrix then the first singular

178
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:47,120
value of t mu to the k is the first

179
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:51,560
singular value of t mu to the k.

180
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,560
It helps to have a blackboard to sit.

181
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,200
Okay. And so that suggests a this is

182
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,959
helpful. This isn't true for

183
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,560
non-ymmetric matrices but it's true for

184
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,040
symmetric matrices. And it suggests a

185
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,760
strategy of how to get a handle on sigma

186
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,880
1 of t mu. So we can say the following

187
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,240
thing. Um

188
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,120
so we have sigma 1. Yeah. Let's also

189
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,720
think about t mu to the k. So t mu to

190
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:24,320
the k of f is f convolved with mu and

191
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:27,600
then convolved with mu and so on k times

192
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,120
uh which is f convolved with mu

193
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,600
convolved with itself k times.

194
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,360
So that's an operator of our type but

195
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,040
with a new measure. The measure is mu

196
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:43,040
convolved with itself k times.

197
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:48,240
Okay. So therefore sigma 1 of t mu to

198
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:55,160
the k sigma 1 t mu to the k

199
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:55,160
which is sigma 1 of t mu to the k. Uh

200
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,680
so if you try to explain this without a

201
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,760
blackboard, you have to have really

202
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,760
good ability to invoke things with your

203
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,760
voice.

204
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,440
All right.

205
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,920
Okay. So mu might be um the uniform

206
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,680
measure on this set of four elements A.

207
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,519
And if we apply this proposition

208
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,040
directly to that set of four elements,

209
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,560
it gives us nothing. But we can use this

210
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,040
and then we can try to apply the

211
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,839
proposition to mu to the k.

212
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,200
Um so if we put together what we have

213
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:37,760
can make the following corlary. Um sigma

214
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:41,600
1 t mu to the k. So okay so this is if

215
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:45,760
mu is a probability measure

216
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,240
on SL2 or fp

217
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,399
um then

218
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,040
sigma 1 of t mu to the k it's bounded by

219
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:59,440
well this thing and for this thing we we

220
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:02,880
can apply our proposition here

221
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:09,320
so we get

222
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,320
p ^ 2 * mu 2 * k L2.

223
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,240
Okay.

224
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,800
Um so the original for for the original

225
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,839
if you take the subbook measure a then

226
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,160
for the original mua um this thing would

227
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,320
be much too big to be interesting. But

228
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,959
perhaps we could find a high power k

229
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,040
where this L2 norm is actually smaller

230
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,160
than 1 over p^2 and that would give us

231
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,160
an interesting bound.

232
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,440
Okay,

233
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,920
cool. So, so all of the stuff that we'll

234
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,720
that we'll talk about today is based on

235
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,160
this corollary. Um, so we can think

236
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,480
about it like this. You start off with

237
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,639
the probability measure mu. We want to

238
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,320
know if does it get really evenly mixed

239
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:01,440
if you convolve it with itself a lot of

240
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,200
times. And what we'll see here is that

241
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,240
maybe if you convolve it with itself a

242
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,959
bunch of times, it will get

243
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,360
fairly well mixed. Not spectacularly

244
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,600
well mixed, but just fairly well mixed

245
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,160
to guarantee that this L2 norm is

246
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,160
smaller than 1 over P^2.

247
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,320
So if if it manages to be kind of

248
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,880
roughly evenly distributed around P to

249
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,240
the 2.1 elements in this group, that

250
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,320
would be good enough that this would be

251
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,079
less than one.

252
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,440
Once that happens, we can use this

253
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,279
correlary and we can bound sigma 1.

254
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,600
And once we bound sigma one, then we'll

255
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,959
see that that in turn tells us what

256
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,399
happens as we keep mixing. Then we'll be

257
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,519
able to say it gets really very well

258
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,519
mixed at some later time.

259
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,959
Okay. Okay. But how can we so how can we

260
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,519
bond this? How can we approach uh show

261
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,480
that that mu tensor k is is decently

262
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,240
well mixed fairly well mixed. Um okay.

263
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,880
So there are two different um approaches

264
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,240
that we'll talk about today. What so one

265
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,959
approach which is special for this

266
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,959
theorem involves either um

267
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,959
uh let me say it involves lifting to

268
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,880
SL2Z

269
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,639
um andor it involves hyperbolic

270
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,760
geometry. I'll describe it in a couple

271
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,760
of different slightly different ways.

272
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:26,199
Okay. So first let's talk about lifting

273
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,199
to SL2Z.

274
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:36,600
Okay. So if you reduce mod P it gives a

275
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,600
group homorphism from SL2Z to SL2F.

276
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,160
Okay. Um

277
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,320
so let's suppose that M is a probability

278
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,440
measure

279
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,600
on SL2Z

280
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:59,440
and mu is the push forward pi P of M. So

281
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:02,000
that's a probability measure here.

282
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,920
And this setup with group homorphisms

283
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,959
commutes plays nicely with convolution.

284
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:13,760
So um if I take the push forward of m

285
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:18,519
convolved with itself k times I will get

286
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,519
mu convolved with itself k times.

287
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,839
Okay, so one approach to try to

288
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,240
understand mu convolved with itself a

289
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,079
bunch of times is to first try to

290
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,079
understand m convolved with itself a

291
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,839
bunch of times and then try to

292
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,440
understand what happens when we perform

293
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:41,120
this push word.

294
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:46,160
Um okay

295
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:48,320
cool so here's our plan

296
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,079
study

297
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,079
m convolve with itself k times to the

298
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,720
study

299
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,720
push forward operation.

300
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,079
Okay,

301
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,759
so this is a a reasonable strategy

302
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,959
because of the fact or to the extent

303
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:13,320
that we feel that SL2Z is easier to get

304
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,320
our hands on than SL2FP.

305
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,360
Um, okay. And there is a there are a

306
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,880
couple of reasons that SL2Z is easier to

307
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:28,759
get our hands on than SL2FP.

308
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,759
Let me call this um good features

309
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,320
of SL2Z.

310
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Okay, we won't necessarily use all of

311
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:41,120
these but let me mention them. So the

312
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:45,399
first feature is that SL2Z

313
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,399
is virtually free.

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,040
So what virtually means is that there is

315
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:55,240
a subgroup H and SL2Z

316
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,240
which is a finite index

317
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,399
free subgroup.

318
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,800
So in general if you say that a group is

319
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,319
virtually blah it means that there's a

320
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,079
finite index subgroup which is blah.

321
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,360
Okay. So it's pretty close to being

322
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,600
free. That's not true at all for SL2FP.

323
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,919
So you take SL2FP, take the simplest

324
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,880
generators you can think of. Try to

325
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,039
write down all the relations.

326
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,160
Not super easy. I I don't personally

327
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,199
know how to do it, although I think

328
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,679
people know how to do it.

329
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,840
Okay.

330
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,600
Um Okay. Number two,

331
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,320
SL2Z

332
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,919
is uh sort of sitting sitting inside of

333
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,400
SL2R.

334
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,120
It's kind of a discrete approximation of

335
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,320
SL2R. So it's pretty closely related to

336
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:50,440
a league group.

337
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,440
This is what we'll actually use.

338
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:02,240
Okay. And number three is that SL2Z

339
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,240
um acts nicely. This is maybe I should

340
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,840
call it 2B. It's quite closely related

341
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:11,480
to two. um it acts nicely on the

342
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,480
hyperbolic plane.

343
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,120
So recall that the isometries of the

344
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,120
hyperbolic plane is PSL2R.

345
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,559
So SL2R it's basically SL2R not quite.

346
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,400
Um so SL2R acts by isometries on the

347
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,720
hyperbolic plane and SL2Z is sitting

348
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,200
inside there. So it acts by isometries

349
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,240
on the hyperbolic plane.

350
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,799
um and that action is is captures a lot

351
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,039
of SL2Z. So you can also use this to to

352
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,480
help understand SL2Z.

353
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,160
All right. And so all three of these

354
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,160
things are much more complicated for

355
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,160
SL2FP.

356
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Okay.

357
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,480
[Applause]

358
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,320
Um

359
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,280
all right so I I don't so the one of the

360
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,600
things I won't completely prove is some

361
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,720
thing about about doing convolutions on

362
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:27,440
SL2Z but I want to give some intuition

363
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,840
and rough statement about it. So

364
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,440
intuition

365
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,440
about

366
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,440
convolution

367
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:44,400
on SL2 Z.

368
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,600
Um so as a warm-up I want to think about

369
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,600
convolution on Z.

370
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,280
Okay. So let's say new is a probability

371
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,880
measure

372
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:02,080
on Z and I take new convolved with

373
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,320
itself k times. So new is some fixed

374
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:09,360
simple probability measure. Uh maybe

375
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:14,720
let's take new new of x is a half of x

376
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:16,799
is plus -1 zero otherwise.

377
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,160
Okay. So what happens when we convolve

378
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,120
it with itself K times? Um well the

379
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:27,080
central limit theorem tells us that this

380
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,080
thing is almost a Gaussian.

381
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:34,679
Gaussian also closely related to the

382
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,679
heat kernel on R.

383
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,720
Okay. So in analogy with this um what

384
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,880
might we hope to happen when we take a

385
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:51,840
measure on SL2Z and we convolve it with

386
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:57,679
itself alpha that uh so you might hope

387
00:20:51,840 --> 00:21:00,880
so we have M measure probability measure

388
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:04,720
on SL2Z.

389
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:09,679
So you might hope to have some kind of

390
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:13,679
um central limit theorem for

391
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:17,360
matrices and it would say that M convuls

392
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:19,440
with itself a lot is sort of like

393
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,400
the heat kernel which needs to be

394
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,799
defined

395
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,799
on SR2R.

396
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,120
Okay, so this seems like a natural thing

397
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,000
in the intersection of probability

398
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,360
theory and matrix theory and has been

399
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,039
studied although I'm not an expert on

400
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:50,039
it. Um but CF work of first invogue

401
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,039
and

402
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,720
okay um so I believe that I know roughly

403
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,799
how it works out although I don't have a

404
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,799
precise statement but um let me tell you

405
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,880
roughly how I think it works out and

406
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,840
then we'll see how this would be helpful

407
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,679
to understand SL2FP.

408
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,480
Okay, so first of all, we'll have some

409
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,039
kind of balls in SL2R.

410
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:23,919
So BT

411
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:28,240
is the set of matrices A B C D in SL2R

412
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:34,520
with the property that A2 + B^2 + C^2 +

413
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,520
D^2 is at most R is at most T^2.

414
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,960
Okay. Um, so this is some sort of rough

415
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,559
some sort of notion of a ball in the

416
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,400
group SL2R. Um, you could imagine a

417
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,240
fancier notion where you start with the

418
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,000
Lee algebra and you put a ball in the

419
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,000
Lee algebra and you take the exponential

420
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,200
map and that's probably a better thing

421
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,760
to do than this. Um, but this is a very

422
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,120
lowbrow definition and it is sort of

423
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,559
approximately describes balls.

424
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,480
Okay. And then if we're interested in

425
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,320
SL2Z, we would take the integer points

426
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:12,080
in this BT of Z. That's defined to be uh

427
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:15,080
BT intersected with SL2Z. So these are

428
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,080
integers.

429
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:22,960
Okay. So for reference um what is the

430
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:28,720
cardality of BT of Z? So little lema

431
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:31,600
cardality of BT of Z is roughly T ^2. Um

432
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,320
sketch

433
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,360
um clearly choose

434
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:42,400
a and d

435
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:47,520
minus tt. So that's t² choices.

436
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:50,640
And then we have to solve b * c is a * d

437
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,720
minus one. I think I did that right. So

438
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,799
here you know sl2r determinant is one.

439
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,200
So a d minus bc is one.

440
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,320
Okay. So we have this integer of size

441
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,320
around t ^2 and we want to know how many

442
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,440
ways are there to factor it into two

443
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:11,440
integers of size around t.

444
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,520
Um okay so um

445
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,720
so not every integer will factor like

446
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,360
this. It could be prime but mostly they

447
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:23,440
will factor like that. And how many ways

448
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,640
will they factor? Well not too many ways

449
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,520
by most t to the epsilon ways. So, so

450
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,279
number of choices

451
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,039
for B and C is on and the order of so

452
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,200
the level of our back of the envelope

453
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,240
computation there should be about T^2

454
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:47,320
group elements in

455
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:47,320
all right so there's a vague statement

456
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:56,159
that if you fix M then MAR to the K is

457
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,159
roughly

458
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,880
equidistributed

459
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:06,480
on the ball of radius t

460
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:10,559
for t around exponential of some

461
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:15,200
constant depending on m * k.

462
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:16,880
So it's not stated precisely but this is

463
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,080
roughly what I think the central limit

464
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,080
theorem should say in SL2Z.

465
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,960
Okay.

466
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,039
In a little bit we'll do the hyperbolic

467
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,400
geometry point of view where I'll be

468
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,720
able to state things a little bit better

469
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,720
if we want.

470
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,880
Okay. Okay. So that's step one of our

471
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:52,480
plan. Study what the convolution looks

472
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,159
like in upstairs in SL2Z.

473
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,039
And next we need to think about what

474
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:00,679
happens when we project from SL2Z down

475
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,679
to SL2FP.

476
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,640
Why don't we pause there actually? I

477
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,400
mean I uh so I did some things not

478
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,880
completely precisely but let me see if

479
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,360
people have any questions or comments or

480
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,360
bothered by things.

481
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,559
Yeah,

482
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,919
>> question about kind of the link to the

483
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:31,120
existence of heat kernel that

484
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,600
like the heat kernel and R and in

485
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,520
general kind of uklidian looking spaces

486
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,039
is kind of closely related to the forier

487
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,679
transform but in a nonian group is there

488
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:44,240
anything analogous to that that sort of

489
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,520
makes this some sort of heat kernelish

490
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,720
thing work?

491
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,320
>> Yeah. So the question is um

492
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,159
how does the heat kernel work in a

493
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,080
nonabelian group? Um let me punt on that

494
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,000
until we get to the hyperbolic space

495
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,679
version and and we'll talk about the

496
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,760
heat kernel there which is a little bit

497
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,360
easier for at least for me to make it

498
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08,880
precise. Yeah. Okay. So let's do the

499
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:12,760
second step where we pass from SL2F from

500
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,760
SL2Z to SL2FP.

501
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,000
Okay, so remember our setup that M is a

502
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,720
probability measure

503
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,200
on SL2Z

504
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:41,120
and then mu is the push forward of M.

505
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,720
It's probability measure on SL2 FP.

506
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:48,400
Um, also let's mention that gamma P

507
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,799
could be the kernel of pi P. So that's a

508
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,799
normal subgroup

509
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,080
of SL2Z

510
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:06,960
and it's gamma P is the set of A B C D

511
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,320
in SL2Z.

512
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:14,799
So that um

513
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,799
a d bc is congruent to the identity mod

514
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,799
p.

515
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,559
Okay, great. So now our goal is to

516
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,760
understand the L2 norm of some

517
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,360
convolution of this. And here's a cute

518
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,520
trick

519
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,559
um little lama.

520
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,200
So if mu is symmetric

521
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,840
so for instance if m is symmetric

522
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,760
um then

523
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:49,520
mu tensor k l2

524
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:52,559
is mu tens or 2k of the identity.

525
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,080
So here's the proof. Uh let's start on

526
00:28:52,559 --> 00:29:01,200
the other side. Mu tensor 2k of the

527
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:03,039
identity is well mu tensor k convolved

528
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,320
with sorry I was saying the word tensor

529
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,960
that was not the right word I mean

530
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,520
convolved mu convolved k convolved with

531
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,600
mu convolved k

532
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,200
the identity

533
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:19,760
so that's the sum over g in our group

534
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,840
mu convolved k of g mu convolved k of g

535
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,080
inverse that's how you convolve two

536
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,080
functions

537
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,600
But what's nice is mu is symmetric is

538
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:35,039
that these are the same as each other.

539
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:37,120
So we just get the sum on g mult k of g^

540
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:41,000
squ.

541
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,000
So that's equal to that.

542
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,159
Okay cool. So that's sort of convenient

543
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,640
because now we just have to estimate

544
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:55,039
this one thing.

545
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:57,120
Um and mu convolved 2k of the identity

546
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,799
is if we that's that's something that

547
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,960
lives here but we can relate it to

548
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:08,679
something that lives here. It's the sum

549
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:08,679
g in gamma p of m convolved 2 k of g.

550
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,320
So in other words, we want to know how

551
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,440
much mass what what is the measure using

552
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,360
this m measure m involved 2k what is the

553
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,919
measure of the subgroup gamma p.

554
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,080
All right now m convolved 2k is

555
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:34,840
approximately evenly distributed on some

556
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,840
ball. So um by the vague statement

557
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:46,120
this is sort of equivalent to estimating

558
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,120
what fraction of the ball is in gamma P.

559
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,120
So we have some big ball in our league

560
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,320
group. What fraction of it is in the

561
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,600
subgroup gamma P.

562
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:02,399
Okay. So remark

563
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:04,480
the index of gamma p is the cardality of

564
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,480
sl2fp

565
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:11,600
which is around p cubed. So if this were

566
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,360
sort of evenly distributed um then you

567
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,600
would expect this quotient to be about 1

568
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,240
over p cubed.

569
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,399
Okay. And that's basically true. And so

570
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,320
here's another lema.

571
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,080
Um,

572
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:30,880
BT intersected with gamma P is bounded

573
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:34,000
by T ^2 over P cubed, which is also like

574
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,000
the size of BT of Z

575
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,200
over Q cubed.

576
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,200
So it is pretty evenly distributed.

577
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,159
Okay.

578
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,760
All right. So here's the proof.

579
00:31:52,559 --> 00:32:00,799
So we're looking for

580
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:03,600
a b c d where each entry

581
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,360
is size smaller than t and they're

582
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,679
integers.

583
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,519
And we want

584
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:14,519
um this to be congruent to 1 0 0 1 mod

585
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,519
p.

586
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,240
Okay. So first of all let's try to do a

587
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,720
back of the envelope calculation.

588
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,039
Um

589
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,559
so there if I don't if I erase this

590
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,159
congruence condition then I'm just

591
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,559
asking how many integer points are there

592
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,240
in bt and we said before that's about t

593
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,480
^2.

594
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Now I'd like a to be congruent to one

595
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:51,440
mod p. So maybe I should divide by p for

596
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,279
that. And I'd like b to be congruent to

597
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,120
zero. So maybe I should divide by p

598
00:32:53,279 --> 00:33:01,279
again. And I have four conditions. So

599
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,760
maybe I should divide by P4 times P ^2 /

600
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,760
P 4th.

601
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,240
Is anybody suspicious?

602
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,799
Okay, so that's the wrong answer. It

603
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,640
should be closer to t ^2 / p cubed. And

604
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,240
the reason that that was not really okay

605
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,559
to do is that those four conditions are

606
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,679
not independent of each other. We

607
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,080
already know that a d minus bc is one

608
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,159
because we're in um okay, I didn't write

609
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,080
this properly. This is supposed to be in

610
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,840
SL2Z,

611
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,440
which means that AD minus BC equals 1.

612
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,799
Um, and I think that probably implies

613
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,159
that once I have three of these

614
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,960
congruence conditions, then I would get

615
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,559
the fourth. Okay, but it also brings up

616
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,960
the point that I should shouldn't be too

617
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,559
fast and loose. Uh, that it's it's not

618
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,120
super obvious that all of these things

619
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,919
are independent of each other.

620
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,559
Um, so there is actually a kind of

621
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,399
algebra trick to make this work.

622
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,559
that allows us to keep things more

623
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,200
independent of each other. And here's

624
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,200
the algebra trick.

625
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:14,320
Okay, so um B is divisible by P and C is

626
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,000
divisible by P.

627
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:21,280
So P divides B and P divides C.

628
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,159
Therefore P divides BC

629
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,440
and BC is A D minus one.

630
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:30,480
So sorry P ^2 divides BC

631
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,119
and so P ^2 divides a D minus one. These

632
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:38,560
are equal to each other.

633
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:43,159
All right. Similarly P + 1 divides A

634
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,159
uh sorry P divides A minus one.

635
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:50,879
A is congruent to one mod P and P

636
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:55,040
divides D minus one. So p ^2 divides a

637
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:57,599
minus1 * d minus one.

638
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,079
All right. The leading term here is also

639
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,760
a * d. So we can play these off against

640
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:08,599
each other and we conclude that p ^2

641
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,599
divides a + d minus 2.

642
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,800
All right. Now let's start choosing

643
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,040
things.

644
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,359
So we're going to choose a and um a has

645
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,839
an integer of size at most t and it's

646
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:30,040
congruent to one mod p. So I have less

647
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,040
than t over p choices.

648
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,720
Next I'm going to choose d.

649
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,560
I've already chosen a. So I now know the

650
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,040
value of d modulo p^2 because of this

651
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:51,520
sneaky algebra trick.

652
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:53,200
So I get at most t over p^2 choices.

653
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,240
This was only really okay if t is at

654
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,240
least p ^2. So let me say t is at least

655
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,240
p^2.

656
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,079
Okay. And now once I've chosen A and D

657
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,880
uh now I I have to solve for B and C.

658
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,160
And I forget about all the congruences

659
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,839
just like above at most around one

660
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:20,599
choices.

661
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:20,599
And so now they're less than one choice.

662
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:29,720
Choose B and C. And that's because BC is

663
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,720
A D minus one as integers.

664
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,640
Yeah.

665
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,359
>> When you're saying there's kind of at

666
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,280
most one factorization of a minus one,

667
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,960
would that actually be a log of

668
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,480
being precise the number of factors?

669
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,320
>> Yeah. So the question is how many

670
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,320
factors are there of a number of some

671
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,480
size? Um and it it is a little super

672
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,640
constant. It's actually so if this

673
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,320
number has size n, it's actually more

674
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,000
than log n. It could be potentially

675
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,040
could be worse than that, but it's less

676
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,119
than n to the epsilon for any epsilon.

677
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,160
And um and that's what this symbol was

678
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,960
supposed to mean.

679
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,240
>> Okay.

680
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,680
Simples being slightly different

681
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,680
versions of equality.

682
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,680
>> Yeah.

683
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,880
Okay. Um,

684
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,040
so any other questions or comments about

685
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,040
the lema?

686
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,960
Okay. So, so those are the ingredients

687
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,800
of the proof of the Sarna proof of

688
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,480
theorem one. All the ingredients are

689
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,640
rigorous and precise except for the

690
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,079
vague statement about how random walks

691
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,839
behave on SL2Z. And if you if if we're

692
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,410
willing to believe that, then we can put

693
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:45,660
them together and prove theorem one.

694
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,660
[Applause]

695
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,599
Okay. So proof of theorem one.

696
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:19,880
So m will be m a for this set a on sl2z.

697
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,280
Um then by the vague statement

698
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,960
mvolves k times is roughly

699
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:37,200
equidistributed

700
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:41,240
on bt where t is around x of some

701
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,240
constant time k.

702
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:48,480
Okay. So now we will choose

703
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,960
k. So we'll choose t to be a little more

704
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,359
than p ^ 2 so that we can use the lema

705
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,359
at the end which means that k is around

706
00:38:53,359 --> 00:39:00,320
log p. We take around log p steps and

707
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:04,480
after that m convolved k is roughly

708
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,160
evenly distributed on a ball of size t p

709
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,240
^2.

710
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:15,040
Uh okay um and I guess we can here we

711
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:19,520
can put 2k I guess. So then m 2k of

712
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:22,160
gamma p will be around bt intersect

713
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,560
gamma p over bt

714
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,440
which is smaller than like e to the

715
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,280
minus3 by our lamma. And here we're

716
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,400
losing a little power. So if I wanted to

717
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,800
be more clear about what I was saying it

718
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,040
would be something like uh something

719
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,040
like this.

720
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,119
Okay.

721
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,920
Therefore,

722
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:52,000
mu tensor k l2^ 2 that's the same thing

723
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:55,599
as m tensor 2 k of gamma p. And so that

724
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,520
would be around pus 3 + epsilon in

725
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,000
particular significantly smaller than

726
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,839
pus 2.

727
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:08,079
Um and then we use the correlary

728
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:11,839
that gives us a bound for for this

729
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:17,400
and we get that sigma 1 t mu is less

730
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,400
than 1 - c right is independent of p

731
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,359
Okay, let me tell you just briefly about

732
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,599
the hyper hyperbolic geometry point of

733
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,640
view and then we'll switch to other

734
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,640
choices of generators.

735
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,280
Okay. Hyperbolic geometry.

736
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:21,520
All right. So we mentioned that SL2Z or

737
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:26,720
SL2R acts on the hyperbolic plane H2.

738
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:30,800
Let's say that X of P is H2 modulo gamma

739
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,920
P. So X of one is the hyperbolic plane

740
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,920
modulo SL2Z

741
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:41,680
and X of P is a cover of it.

742
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,440
X of P is a cover

743
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:48,440
of X of one and the group of deck

744
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,440
transformations

745
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,880
is SL2FP.

746
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,960
Okay. So I'd like to try to make a

747
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,800
picture of this. So x of one is not

748
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,800
quite a manifold, but it's not super

749
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,720
important for this except for being a

750
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,319
technical irritation. So I'm not going

751
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:19,680
to try to draw that. Um, so it is

752
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:22,000
uh almost a non-compact manifold of

753
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,000
genus Y. It looks sort of like this. The

754
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,319
non-compactness is annoying, but it's

755
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,319
maybe important.

756
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:33,920
Um, so then X of P is a cover of this.

757
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:37,720
So, it's going to look

758
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,720
sort of like so.

759
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,760
And it I guess it has a cusp for each.

760
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:51,200
Yeah, it also has some cusps. Not sure

761
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:55,440
exactly how many.

762
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,599
And this is a cover. Um, so how to make

763
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,040
that look nice?

764
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:04,400
Well, you could kind of chop this into

765
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,400
fundamental domains

766
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,599
and then each fundamental domain is a

767
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,680
bjection onto x of one. And if you do

768
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,440
this nicely, so then the different

769
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,960
fundamental domains, they correspond to

770
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,440
the group of deck transformations, which

771
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,280
is SL2 of FP.

772
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,520
And if you do this nicely, you could put

773
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,960
like a dot in each fundamental domain

774
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:26,560
and you could put an edge if the

775
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:30,560
fundamental domains um touch each other.

776
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:35,920
And the the graph that I just drew would

777
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:39,560
be the uh k would be a kaly graph

778
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,560
of SL2FP.

779
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,839
So the geometry of these two dimensional

780
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,560
surfaces is closely related to the

781
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,560
geometry of SL2FP.

782
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,160
Okay.

783
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:01,720
So then uh we would talk about the

784
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,720
spectrum of the lelassian

785
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:08,160
on x of p

786
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,920
our subject of study and um zero is in

787
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,800
the spectrum. So the plashion of a

788
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,800
constant function is zero

789
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,160
but after zero there's a gap. So if this

790
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,000
is the real lang and here's zero that's

791
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,839
part of the spectrum but then there's a

792
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,560
gap and this is called lambda 1 of x of

793
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,560
p and the rest of the spectrum lives

794
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,560
here

795
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,480
is contained in

796
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:48,160
okay so that's what lambda 1 is the

797
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,400
smallest nonzero part of the spectrum

798
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:53,760
All right. So the theorem that Selberg

799
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:58,079
actually proved in the 1950s

800
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,680
is that lambda 1 of x of p is at least

801
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,839
316

802
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,839
for all.

803
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,079
And the conjecture

804
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:13,119
is that lambda 1 of x of p is at least a

805
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,720
quarter maybe minus little o of one. Not

806
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,319
sure if you need it but certainly if

807
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,359
somebody proved that that would be a big

808
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,359
deal uh for all.

809
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,680
Okay, this that may not look immediately

810
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:27,200
that it matters very much. A quarter is

811
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,920
a significant number because it's lambda

812
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:32,000
one of hyperbolic plane. So I would say

813
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,119
it matches that

814
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,040
anyway. So this is the theorem that

815
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,960
Selberg actually proved. With modern

816
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,560
techniques, it's not that difficult to

817
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,240
get from this theorem to that theorem.

818
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,200
it's much more difficult to prove either

819
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:46,160
one of them.

820
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,480
Um,

821
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:51,520
okay. Instead of the random walk, we

822
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:55,040
could use here the heat flow

823
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:57,440
on X of P. And there was a question

824
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,800
earlier like what what is the heat flow?

825
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,880
So the question earlier was what is the

826
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,240
heat flow on SL2R?

827
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,680
But the analysis question here is what

828
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,960
is the heat flow on this hyperbolic

829
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:10,680
manifold? Um well you can think of it as

830
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,680
solving the heat equation.

831
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:19,760
So the heat equation would be del t of u

832
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,359
equals lelassian of u and the lelassian

833
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,440
okay would take a while to write down

834
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,119
but it's a it's a second order

835
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,960
differential operator on your hyperbolic

836
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:28,640
manifold.

837
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:34,160
All right.

838
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:37,680
Um okay and the solution has a formula

839
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:42,240
using the using a heat flow operator. Um

840
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:45,599
so that so let's say so u of dot comma t

841
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,839
would be ht of u. So this is now an

842
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:53,160
operator ht which plays the role of our

843
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:53,160
operator t mu or t mu to the k.

844
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:01,920
Okay. Um

845
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,560
so everything we talked about with like

846
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,720
a little bit more analysis and PTE to

847
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:11,839
set things up everything we talked about

848
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:14,880
applies here. So for instance, SL2 of FP

849
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:18,960
acts isomemmetrically

850
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:21,599
on X of P and therefore it acts on the

851
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:25,960
igen spaces

852
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,960
of H of H2

853
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:35,079
they have multiplicity.

854
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:35,079
Um and also you can do lifting.

855
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:44,240
So ht tilda is the heat operator

856
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:51,520
on the universal cover the hyperbolic

857
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:57,280
plane and then ht of x1 x2 is the sum

858
00:47:51,520 --> 00:48:00,240
over g and gamma p of ht tilda x1 tilda

859
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,760
gx2 tilda.

860
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,760
So in other words, the the new heat

861
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,280
operator is take the heat operator on

862
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,359
the hyperbolic plane and push it

863
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,839
forward.

864
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:12,160
And that follows basically because that

865
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,599
this is a local equation. So solution to

866
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,560
the heat equation, you pull back, you

867
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,560
get a solution to the heat equation.

868
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:25,839
Uh okay. Um and ht tilda the heat kernel

869
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,400
on the hyperbolic plane it has an

870
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,400
explicit formula

871
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:38,119
and that's the equivalent that's plays

872
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,119
the role of the vague statement.

873
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,880
Okay.

874
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,640
So this hopefully is a dictionary of

875
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,359
most of the elements of our proof that

876
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,319
they they all have natural analoges for

877
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:53,599
this hyperbolic surface and the one that

878
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:55,760
was most troubling has a less troubling

879
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,079
analog or the one that you know was not

880
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,480
stated precisely would have a precisely

881
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,720
stated analog. Okay. So without doing

882
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,640
all the details, if you then translate

883
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,680
the proof that we did into the setting

884
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,839
of hyperbolic surfaces, um then that

885
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,599
would give a proof of a theorem like

886
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,280
this one with a constant that's not

887
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,200
quite as good, but usually it doesn't

888
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,920
matter. Yeah.

889
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,319
>> Question about the heat flow. Since the

890
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,000
uh spaces x of p are not compact, does

891
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:25,280
there have to be some sort of like decay

892
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,319
condition to make the heat flow

893
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,880
spaces?

894
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:31,359
>> Yeah. So the question is since X of P is

895
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,520
not compact should we have some kind of

896
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:36,160
decay condition to make the heat flow

897
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,559
work? Yeah, I think the answer is yes.

898
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:40,319
So these spaces have finite area. So

899
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,400
it's not as bad as it would be in some

900
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:44,000
other settings. But I think we should we

901
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,359
should say something about the solution

902
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,359
not going crazy near infinity.

903
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:56,800
Yeah.

904
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,119
Okay. So this is the end of our

905
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,680
discussion of the Selberg theorem for

906
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,960
this particular set of generators. So

907
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,200
take a moment to see if you have

908
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,280
questions or comments about it and then

909
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,640
we'll explore what would happen if we

910
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,640
didn't have that particular set of

911
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,640
generators.

912
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,480
Yeah. Anything on people's minds?

913
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,280
>> Yeah.

914
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:34,400
>> Can you give some intuition why the uh

915
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,640
the support grows exponentially?

916
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:41,040
>> Yeah. Okay. So, the question was if we

917
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:43,280
go back to um

918
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:46,079
we we thinking about we had a

919
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,720
probability measure on SL2Z. We convolve

920
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,599
it with itself a lot of times and then

921
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:53,520
we discover that the support it's

922
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:58,800
roughly evenly distributed on a ball of

923
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:00,559
size t but t grows exponentially with k.

924
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:04,160
Okay.

925
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:06,160
Yeah. So this is a a kind of different

926
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,319
behavior from what happens on the real

927
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,040
line. Uh let's talk think about what's

928
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:13,040
going on. So m let's say is just evenly

929
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,599
distributed between a few matrices.

930
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,359
maybe the matrices in the Selberg thing.

931
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,040
So now I'm going to take K of those

932
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:22,240
matrices and I'm going to multiply them

933
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,800
together. Now if I multiply K matrices

934
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:28,480
together, the biggest that the entries

935
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:30,800
could be at the end is exponential in K.

936
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,200
On the other hand, you might wonder is

937
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,040
it really that big or is there some

938
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,920
cancellation?

939
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:41,200
Like suppose I had one by one matrices

940
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:44,319
and I had a measure that 50% I was a

941
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:46,640
half and 50% it was two. Take K of those

942
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:48,640
and I multiply them together. What would

943
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,680
happen? Well, there'd be a lot of

944
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,200
cancellation. There are a lot of

945
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,559
cancellations between the 1/ halfs and

946
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,800
the twos. Uh it would get clearer to us

947
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,440
if we took the logarithm of everything.

948
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,119
Um and the size of that would actually

949
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,000
end up being exponential of the square

950
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:07,359
root of k.

951
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,079
So the 2x2 case is different from that.

952
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:12,079
Uh the actual size of this is typically

953
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,559
exponential in K. There's not as much

954
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:17,920
cancellation of that kind.

955
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:21,040
And um let's see what how can we get

956
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:24,800
some intuition about that. Uh

957
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:27,800
>> in some sense because of the virtual

958
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,800
so

959
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,000
this tells you that the group kind of

960
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,359
looks like a

961
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,440
>> Yeah, it's a good comment. So the

962
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:40,480
comment was uh SL2Z is virtually free.

963
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:43,359
So it's not very likely to to sort of go

964
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:47,280
out in SL2Z and then come back. And that

965
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:49,599
that's a related fact. Yeah. Yeah. So

966
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,440
the the it's also related to hyperbolic

967
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,880
geometry. So you do a random walk in the

968
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:57,119
hyperbolic plane. Um if you take S

969
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,920
steps, you'll typically be around a

970
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,160
distance s from the origin. And that's

971
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,960
because the hyperbolic plane is sort of

972
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,880
branching out. And so at every moment,

973
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,359
you're not equally likely to be going

974
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,720
back towards where the origin or away.

975
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:12,559
You're kind of threequarters of the

976
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,520
directions are away. And that's what

977
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:18,720
life is like inside of the matrices.

978
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:22,040
Yeah, great question. Anything else on

979
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,040
people's minds?

980
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,680
All right.

981
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:33,839
So,

982
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:36,480
[Applause]

983
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,920
so let's look back at this uh Selberg

984
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,680
theorem now that we understand it

985
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:45,200
better. And we had this particular a

986
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:50,040
listed here. Um what did we really use

987
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,040
about a what was special about a

988
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,440
>> Yeah,

989
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,440
>> we used the fact that it was a

990
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,440
generator.

991
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,599
>> Yeah. So, we use that it's a generator

992
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,520
of SL2 of FP. Um, and what I'd like us

993
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:06,880
all to think about is if we had any set

994
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,319
of generators of SL2 FP,

995
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,240
do we think that this would still be

996
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:13,720
true? And do we think that this proof

997
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,720
would still work?

998
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,040
I'll write that down while you think.

999
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:33,119
So question

1000
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:34,640
can we replace

1001
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,440
a

1002
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:40,760
by any set

1003
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,760
of generators

1004
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,839
of SL2.

1005
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,200
Yeah,

1006
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,640
>> at minimum they need to be symmetric,

1007
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,640
right?

1008
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:56,319
>> Um, yeah, let's say they're symmetric.

1009
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,400
>> Let's focus on the symmetric case. That

1010
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:00,480
made things technically easier and I

1011
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,160
would be happy with any symmetric set of

1012
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,920
generators. Yeah.

1013
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,160
>> Does the set of generators still need to

1014
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,760
be kind of at least close to virtually

1015
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,760
free?

1016
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,480
>> Does it still need to be close to

1017
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,440
virtually free?

1018
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,880
Yeah, that's a good question. Um, so, so

1019
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,960
although I mentioned being virtually

1020
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,599
free, we didn't actually use virtually

1021
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:25,720
free in the proof.

1022
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,720
Um, that was sort of for intuition,

1023
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,040
but we used something in the proof.

1024
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,280
Yeah. Well, it's Yeah,

1025
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,359
>> they're conjugates their own powers or

1026
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,240
something like that, right?

1027
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:39,680
Oh, they're conje

1028
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,640
So the comment was these guys are

1029
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,800
conjugate to their own powers. Yeah. So

1030
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:49,119
that's important but we didn't use that

1031
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:52,480
either. So we we in when we proved that

1032
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:55,359
every representation of SL2FP is big, we

1033
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,799
considered these elements and we use the

1034
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:58,960
fact that they're conjugate to their own

1035
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:01,359
powers. But once we knew abstractly that

1036
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,760
every representation of SL2FP is big, we

1037
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:06,160
just used it as a black box.

1038
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,920
Um, so it's not important that these

1039
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,440
elements in the statement of cells

1040
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,599
theorem are the same elements we used in

1041
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,599
that proof.

1042
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:21,280
Yeah. Good. Okay. But well, so one part

1043
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:26,920
of the answer is that we used

1044
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:26,920
that A uh is a set of generators

1045
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,559
of SL2Z.

1046
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:42,559
Okay, so in the proof where we lifted

1047
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:45,359
things to SL2Z, we took this set A, we

1048
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:47,680
lifted it to SL2Z, and then we did a

1049
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:49,359
random walk on SL2Z. And we needed to

1050
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,440
know that that thing was kind of evenly

1051
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:54,640
distributed. And the only way we could

1052
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:57,280
hope for that to be true is if this was

1053
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,599
a set of generators of SL2Z.

1054
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,720
>> Yeah. like are there any even

1055
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,040
straightforward kind of sets of

1056
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:05,440
generators of SL2 of FP that would not

1057
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,880
be generators of SL2 of Z

1058
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,880
>> right okay so the question is um could

1059
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:14,480
it happen that we have generators of

1060
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,720
SL2FP but they don't generate SL2Z and

1061
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:20,720
um the answer is yes that happens fairly

1062
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:22,880
commonly um and let me show you

1063
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:27,000
an example

1064
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,000
um Okay.

1065
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,480
Yeah. Okay. So, here's an example. Uh

1066
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,599
maybe we won't prove everything, but um

1067
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:46,480
let's say that a k a no I used a

1068
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:54,880
different letter. A um M is the set of 1

1069
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:56,559
+ or minus M 1 0 and 1 + or - M 1 0.

1070
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:02,319
Okay, so this is still a set of four

1071
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:04,880
elements size of a = 4. And if M is 1 or

1072
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:06,799
two, it generates

1073
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,839
SL2Z.

1074
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:12,400
But if M is at least three, it does not

1075
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:13,920
generate does not

1076
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,720
generate

1077
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:20,960
SL tubes.

1078
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:25,680
On the other hand, for every M, for all

1079
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:30,119
almost every P, so for

1080
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:30,119
all but finitely many P.

1081
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:40,599
Um, this AM generates

1082
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,599
SL2 of FP.

1083
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,280
All right. So, why does this happen?

1084
00:58:54,319 --> 00:59:00,480
All right. So, notice that that this guy

1085
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:04,559
is one 011

1086
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:08,640
to the plus or minus m, right?

1087
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:10,880
So if if we so we assume that these guys

1088
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:15,119
generate SL2Z, it's not that hard to

1089
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:18,400
show. Take a word in these guys,

1090
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:20,799
it's only included in the group

1091
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:24,720
generated by these guys if it has a

1092
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:27,440
rather special structure that um you

1093
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:31,200
know each each letter is raised to the

1094
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:33,280
plus or minus n power. So maybe m is 10.

1095
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:36,240
Okay. So now it's clear that most words

1096
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,559
do not look like that.

1097
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,319
Um now it's not immediately clear that

1098
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,760
we don't have the whole group because an

1099
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:44,960
element in the group might be

1100
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,040
represented by many words. Um but we had

1101
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,599
we mentioned before that there has a

1102
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,040
finite index subgroup which is free. So

1103
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:56,160
there are not that many ways to

1104
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:58,000
represent most words. Um so so um so you

1105
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,520
know this tiny subset of the words we

1106
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,480
don't expect it to cover very much of

1107
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,480
the group.

1108
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:08,640
Okay. Um, and life is different in

1109
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,359
SL2FP. And a little later we'll talk

1110
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,680
about who are the subgroups of SL2FP,

1111
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:15,280
but there aren't a whole lot of them.

1112
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,880
And once you have enough elements that

1113
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:20,880
they're not trapped in a subgroup, then

1114
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:23,200
they must generate the whole group.

1115
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,520
Yeah.

1116
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,520
Okay.

1117
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,520
Right.

1118
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,599
So there there are other choices of

1119
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,119
generators for SL2Z. Any choice of

1120
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:36,000
generators would have worked fine in our

1121
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:38,960
argument. But it's actually quite common

1122
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:43,559
that you have some generators for SL2FP

1123
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,559
that they and they don't generate SL2C.

1124
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:51,280
Okay. In this case, our argument um

1125
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:55,599
doesn't work very well.

1126
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:58,720
Let's say that GM is the group generated

1127
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:02,480
by AM.

1128
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:05,119
This group is a lot is a lot harder to

1129
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:07,359
understand than SL2Z.

1130
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:10,000
So for instance, if you were to give

1131
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:12,799
write down a matrix and then you'd like

1132
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,520
to know is it in GM? Like that's not

1133
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:18,960
super easy to figure out.

1134
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:21,119
Um SL2Z are all the integer matrices

1135
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:25,040
where the entries satisfy the equation A

1136
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,799
D minus BC equals 1. um whether or not a

1137
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:29,359
matrix is in this group does not have a

1138
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:31,440
simple criterion like that. As far as I

1139
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:33,119
know, the best thing well I I don't know

1140
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,640
anything faster to do than to take the

1141
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,319
generators and multiply them together

1142
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,680
different ways and see if you get this

1143
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:41,359
matrix. Yeah.

1144
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:44,079
>> How close is GM to gamma M? Like are

1145
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:46,640
they have anything in common? Because at

1146
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:50,720
first it sort of looks like things

1147
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:54,079
congrent to the identity mod,

1148
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:55,839
>> right? So GM is a subgroup. So So okay,

1149
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:58,559
so the question was how close is GM to

1150
01:01:55,839 --> 01:02:02,480
gamma M? Remember that gamma M was the

1151
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:05,599
subgroup of uh matrices in SL2Z that are

1152
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:07,440
congruent to the identity mod M. So

1153
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:09,920
these guys are congruent to the identity

1154
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:13,520
mod M. So therefore, GM is a subgroup of

1155
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:17,000
gamma M. Um however this group has

1156
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:17,000
infinite index

1157
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:25,920
um in SL2Z

1158
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:28,400
for M at least three

1159
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,480
whereas gamma M had finite index because

1160
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:33,440
it was the kernel of a map to a finite

1161
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:36,000
group.

1162
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,760
So, gam gamma m which is not which is

1163
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:42,640
already not a super easy thing to

1164
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:45,440
understand if m is large. Um uh this is

1165
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:47,440
um well okay objectively this is a

1166
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,200
smaller group than gamma m and

1167
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:53,559
subjectively I think it is a harder

1168
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,559
group to understand than gamma m.

1169
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,920
Okay. So this whole method has not

1170
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:03,839
really worked and in fact it goes in the

1171
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:06,799
opposite direction. Um so namely

1172
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:08,799
we for for for generators of SL2Z we

1173
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:11,040
first understand SL2Z really well and

1174
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:14,480
then we can use that to understand SL2FP

1175
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:17,359
with those generators. Um with situation

1176
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,200
like this the there's some progress and

1177
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:21,920
it goes first you try to understand

1178
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,400
SL2FP with those generators and you use

1179
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,599
that to try to understand G of M. So

1180
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,200
there's actually a big literature now

1181
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,200
about these groups G of M and first you

1182
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:32,240
try to figure out things about SL2FP

1183
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:36,000
with those generators.

1184
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:37,440
Okay, so um there is uh okay so so

1185
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,839
that's one part of the answer to this

1186
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,839
question and what we said so far is that

1187
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:44,400
our proof doesn't usually work for other

1188
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:46,079
sets of generators but that's not an

1189
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,880
answer to the question whether the

1190
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:51,039
theorem is true and as far as we know

1191
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,880
the theorem may well be true so there's

1192
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,359
a conjecture you take any set of

1193
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:58,839
generators of SL2FP you just always have

1194
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:58,839
a spectral gap

1195
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,400
that's not proven yet but there's some

1196
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,799
significant progress and I'm I will tell

1197
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,880
you something about

1198
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,559
>> what's the equivalent uh spectral

1199
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,240
statement

1200
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:12,559
>> what is the equivalent spectral

1201
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:15,559
statement

1202
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:15,559
um

1203
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,319
um

1204
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,119
okay so if you take so I'm not sure if

1205
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,839
this is your question but let me say

1206
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:28,400
something and then okay um so so if we

1207
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:30,640
take another set of generators here we

1208
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,680
have a different operator And we can ask

1209
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:35,839
what is sigma 1 and so on. But so I

1210
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:38,160
think you were wondering is if we took

1211
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:40,240
another set of generators there would

1212
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,240
that be related to the spectrum of the

1213
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,039
plashion of something? Is that a

1214
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,760
question?

1215
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:46,760
>> Okay. Um

1216
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,720
okay so not not as far as I know. Um,

1217
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,799
and so you so you might say, you know,

1218
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:58,480
this theorem is great because it

1219
01:04:56,799 --> 01:05:00,400
connects to this hyperbolic geometry and

1220
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,760
it tells us something really interesting

1221
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,559
estimate for the spectrum of some

1222
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:08,000
surface. With other generators, maybe it

1223
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:10,000
doesn't exactly do that. Um, but on the

1224
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,079
other hand, it says some interesting

1225
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:16,119
stuff about this group, which is

1226
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:16,119
interesting in some other problems.

1227
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:19,240
Okay.

1228
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,599
Um, yeah, let's leave that.

1229
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,319
All right.

1230
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,760
Um, all right. So, suppose we're just

1231
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,839
given any set A inside of SL2FP and we'd

1232
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,240
like to figure out if there's a spectral

1233
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:04,240
gap. One thing that we know could go

1234
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:06,079
wrong is that A could be contained in a

1235
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:09,599
subgroup.

1236
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:12,920
So, if A is contained in H, which is a

1237
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,920
proper subgroup,

1238
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:20,039
then sigma 1 TA is one.

1239
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:27,359
All right. So, so that's elementary to

1240
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,920
see. But in order to really use this, we

1241
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:33,200
would actually it helps to know what are

1242
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,880
all the proper subgroups. Um, so let's

1243
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:37,880
talk a little bit about the

1244
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,880
classification

1245
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:47,400
of subgroups

1246
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:47,400
of SL2FP.

1247
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:56,559
Okay.

1248
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:59,680
So, um the classification was done by

1249
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:02,480
someone named Dixon in 1901.

1250
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:06,960
And it's not that hard, but it's not

1251
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:08,400
that easy either. Um, and uh, I was a

1252
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:12,640
little surprised to learn that if you'd

1253
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:15,440
like to classify the subgroups of SLDFP,

1254
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,359
that was only done, first of all, it's

1255
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:20,000
only done approximately and it was only

1256
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:21,760
done around the year 2000.

1257
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,480
So some of these problems actually are

1258
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:29,160
are really pretty hard.

1259
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,160
So done by Dixon in 199.

1260
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,640
Um, okay. Well, let's think of some

1261
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:36,559
subgroups.

1262
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:40,000
We could have the diagonal subgroup,

1263
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:42,640
which is typically called T for Taurus.

1264
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,880
There's this guy. We have the upper

1265
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:49,520
triangular like unipotent subgroup

1266
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:51,280
like that. Um, let me put a little knot

1267
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:53,520
here.

1268
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:56,880
And we have the more general upper

1269
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:59,880
triangular guys which which

1270
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,880
have

1271
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:03,760
Okay. Now if you take a subgroup group

1272
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,440
group you can conjugate it and you can

1273
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:09,160
get another subgroup. So you can

1274
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,160
conjugate all of these.

1275
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:21,080
Okay. And so let me write B that means a

1276
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,080
conjugate of B 0.

1277
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:26,400
Okay. So those are a bunch of subgroups.

1278
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,520
Those are the only ones that I was able

1279
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:33,359
to think of without effort.

1280
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:35,679
Um there are a few other sort of small

1281
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:37,359
subgroups like for instance the

1282
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:41,679
apparently the icosahhedral group

1283
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:43,520
appears in SL2FP for some PS. Um and the

1284
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,920
statement of the classification is a lot

1285
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,759
easier if we don't say exactly what

1286
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,400
groups appear but just kind of roughly

1287
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:53,920
and ignore small groups.

1288
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:58,480
Um so so there's a theorem about this

1289
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:00,400
and the rough theorem would say if H in

1290
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:04,440
SL2FP

1291
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,440
is a proper subgroup

1292
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:18,080
um then there exists a oral subgroup B

1293
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:21,199
one of these guys and um B intersect H

1294
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:23,359
is a large fraction of H.

1295
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:26,920
So this C bigger than zero is a

1296
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,920
universal constant.

1297
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:32,159
So more or less H is in H is not quite

1298
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:34,560
in B, but almost all H has a very large

1299
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:37,679
part that's in B.

1300
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:42,080
Okay. And B is a conjugate of B 0. And

1301
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:44,480
the fine print is conjugate of B 0. um

1302
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:47,920
conjugated by

1303
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:50,239
not necessarily someone in SL2FP, but

1304
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:52,719
maybe the maybe the matrix you conjugate

1305
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:56,199
by might involve the algebraic closure.

1306
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:56,199
I think it's fine.

1307
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:04,719
Okay.

1308
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:09,080
Um, now let's make a remark. The analog

1309
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:09,080
of this is not true

1310
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:18,560
for SL2FQ.

1311
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:21,920
Q Q is a prime power. Um, because SL2FP

1312
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:25,120
is a subgroup of SL2FQ,

1313
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:29,000
but SL2FP is not contained in any like

1314
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:29,000
upper triangle or something.

1315
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:34,400
Um, so the analogous there's an

1316
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:35,440
analogous theorem for SL2FQ, but it

1317
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,440
needs to be stated in a little bit

1318
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,960
different way to take account of the sub

1319
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:41,040
fields.

1320
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,320
So this may already start to remind us

1321
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,080
of something that we've seen that

1322
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:47,239
projection theory is different over FP

1323
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:47,239
and FQ.

1324
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,920
Okay.

1325
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,920
Um

1326
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:03,120
okay so now I can state uh the second

1327
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:06,800
main theorem that I wanted to say about

1328
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:09,440
random walks on groups which is a

1329
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:12,400
generalization of Selberg's theorem and

1330
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:15,199
it allows to take any set of generators

1331
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:17,040
where it's not trapped in a burell

1332
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:19,120
subgroup

1333
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:21,679
but it requires a little quantification

1334
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:26,120
which is perhaps not quite as strong as

1335
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:26,120
one might fantasize about.

1336
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,679
All right. So, um for every epsilon

1337
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:39,159
bigger than zero, there are a couple of

1338
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:39,159
positive constants.

1339
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:49,520
um

1340
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:52,000
every P um okay so if I have a subset of

1341
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:54,480
SL2FP

1342
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,320
and the subset is not contained in a

1343
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,920
burell subgroup and also it doesn't

1344
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:04,000
concentrate too much in a burell

1345
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:07,920
subgroup so for every B or

1346
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:11,199
if I take A intersected with B this is

1347
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:15,280
at most um

1348
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:17,600
uh p to the minus epsilon size of b and

1349
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:21,120
with this small constant.

1350
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:23,679
So a smallest sorry size of a

1351
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:26,159
so only a smallest fraction of a is in

1352
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:27,920
this burell subgroup

1353
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:29,760
and it's a p to the epsilon kind of

1354
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:31,520
fraction where you you that's a pretty

1355
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,360
small fraction you might hope to do a

1356
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:38,880
little better but anyway that's what it

1357
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:41,360
says. Um, and here I wasn't positive if

1358
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,960
it so I'm when I proved it I needed to

1359
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,520
say co-et but I'm not sure if it's

1360
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:47,120
co-set or subgroup anyway. So if it

1361
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,679
doesn't concentrate in something closely

1362
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,840
related to a subgroup um then it

1363
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:56,840
expands. So that then it has a mixed

1364
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,840
sigma 1 of TA is less than 1us.

1365
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:11,920
Okay. So up to a little bit of

1366
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,840
quantification

1367
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:16,159
you know if a set if if a is contained

1368
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:20,080
in a boral subgroup definitely we won't

1369
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:22,239
have a spectral gap and if a is doesn't

1370
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:24,560
intersect a burl subgroup too much then

1371
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:26,400
we will have a spectral gap. It's almost

1372
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:30,440
if and only if although you might hope

1373
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,440
to improve this a little bit.

1374
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:35,120
Okay

1375
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:38,080
so this is kind of its own story to talk

1376
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:40,480
about. So since we're almost done, let

1377
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:42,000
me just make a a couple of highlevel

1378
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:43,840
comments about it. Yeah,

1379
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,239
>> it's a burell subgroup.

1380
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:48,159
>> A burell. Yeah. So I don't know why so

1381
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:50,880
burell is involved in this. A burell

1382
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:53,360
subgroup is these guys. B it's the take

1383
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:58,120
an upper triangular matrix that that's a

1384
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:58,120
burell subgroup or conjugate that.

1385
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:04,480
Okay. So one comment about this theorem

1386
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:06,640
is that it you know we had better know

1387
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:08,159
this theorem better know something like

1388
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,080
this.

1389
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:11,679
Um

1390
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,440
and

1391
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:16,320
so what the first part of this theorem

1392
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:20,480
is to prove that if you don't have a

1393
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:23,600
spectral gap then there must be a subset

1394
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:26,880
that's kind of approximately a subgroup

1395
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,400
that intersects a a lot.

1396
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,080
We don't have a spectral gap. There must

1397
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,719
be a subject subset that's kind of

1398
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:35,280
approximately a subgroup where maybe a

1399
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:37,280
convolved with itself many times is

1400
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:39,360
heavily concentrated in this approximate

1401
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:42,400
subgroup.

1402
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:44,159
Okay. And that's a a very nice argument

1403
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:46,000
and it uses it turns out to use the

1404
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:48,239
tools from additive combinotaurics. It

1405
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:50,560
uses like bality gowers and things like

1406
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:52,480
that or in a non non-commutative

1407
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,640
version.

1408
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:57,760
Okay. Then the second part of the proof

1409
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:59,760
is to say is kind of a robust version of

1410
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,920
this theorem. This is a classification

1411
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,199
of actual subgroups. We want to make it

1412
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:06,239
a little bit stronger and have a

1413
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:09,120
classification of approximate subgroups.

1414
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:11,120
Um so not only any actual proper

1415
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,600
subgroup would have to intersect a

1416
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:15,920
burell subgroup a lot but actually any

1417
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,520
any kind of approximate subgroup. So any

1418
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,920
subset where when you multiply it by

1419
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:22,719
itself two or three times it doesn't get

1420
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:25,600
very much bigger. um the only way that

1421
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:27,520
can happen is if your um is if your

1422
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,760
subset heavily intersects a burell

1423
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:32,560
subgroup.

1424
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:35,840
Okay. Now that second part you'll notice

1425
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:39,360
is not true over FP

1426
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:41,920
is not sorry is not true over FQ.

1427
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:44,400
Um, and so the second part was we'll

1428
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,239
draw on some product theory and our our

1429
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,800
like theorems that we worked very hard

1430
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:53,120
on that give a projection estimate over

1431
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:55,280
F over FP that's not true over FQ. We'll

1432
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:59,600
need that.

1433
01:15:55,280 --> 01:16:01,120
Um, okay. And so I I think this is a

1434
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,199
nice example of how those, you know,

1435
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,880
those theorems are only an epsilon

1436
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:08,480
improvement on a trivial estimate where

1437
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,760
epsilon is very small, but it still is

1438
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,440
meaningful. There's an important

1439
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,640
difference between epsilon being zero or

1440
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:17,679
not zero. And they're used to prove kind

1441
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:22,400
of an, you know, this c of epsilon is

1442
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:23,760
pretty small. But um um but there's

1443
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:25,280
there's a just a really important

1444
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,040
difference between whether you had zero

1445
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,520
here, which is like a completely vacuous

1446
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:31,679
statement, and whether you had one minus

1447
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,840
epsilon, which even if epsilon is a

1448
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:37,760
small constant, is a qualitatively sharp

1449
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:41,080
statement about um about how this random

1450
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,080
