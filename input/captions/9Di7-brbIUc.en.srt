1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,920
thank you everyone um it's a pleasure to

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,799
be back in Houston I think for the sixth

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,280
time in the past uh two months so I'm

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,759
here a lot and uh some people even told

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,880
me that I should find a place to live

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:14,960
here because then I could you know

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,760
reduce the carbon footprint that I

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,960
generate uh through my trips so what we

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,560
do is we build pretty large scale Data

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:26,240
Solutions in solutions for customers in

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:31,119
the energy space and

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,239
um see how I use this is this just click

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,559
yes so before I um describe our products

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,719
I want to show a survey that was

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,800
conducted at this year's SP advanced

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:46,000
technology um conference um from all the

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,719
data professionals at the conference and

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,760
basically the question was what's what

19
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,440
what was their biggest challenge in

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,440
working with data and data science you

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,359
know and the answer as some of you

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,199
probably know here the biggest challenge

23
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,960
is not building data science models the

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,680
biggest challenge is is first just to

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,119
get the data that you can use for data

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,400
science and this is followed by

27
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,799
difficulty in scaling because

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,080
performance is hard once you have large

29
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:16,439
scale Solutions and lack of skills so we

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,840
solve a lot of these problems for our

31
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,840
customers so essentially what we start

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,680
with is we built this things called Data

33
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,520
pipelines um you may not be familiar

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,880
with it but it's basically real time or

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,119
historic data going through the data

36
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:34,560
workflows it gets cleaned gets processed

37
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,159
and so that is ready for AI to use um we

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,799
can get process uh process data from

39
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:42,680
your rcks from your production sites and

40
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:45,240
if you already have the raw data in um

41
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,560
in um uh your data warehouses or

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,799
historians we can grab those and clean

43
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,759
that up and the next thing we do is we

44
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,840
convert that data into something called

45
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,799
events so typical energy data industrial

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,039
data they are time series data right

47
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,200
pressure temperature there there's

48
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,880
actually very little you can do with

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,000
those data but once you can convert them

50
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,080
into events either like simple events

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
like like alarms or very Complex events

52
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,680
like um component models all of a sudden

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,720
you can do very large scale uh bi

54
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:22,560
analysis AI LM digital twins so you know

55
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,239
the conversion um of events is actually

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,120
very critical and doing that at very

57
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,599
large scale is

58
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,400
difficult so if I ask all of you today

59
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,040
that how do you build this type of Data

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
Solutions I think every company does

61
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,360
this to some extent I think the majority

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,879
of you are going to say what we do it in

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,120
software of course that's how we know

64
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,360
how to do the sort of things but all of

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,920
us also know that software is super slow

66
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,000
to build requires very expensive

67
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,440
software developers who do not have the

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,519
domain expertise and um um it's it's

69
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,680
very inflexible to make any changes

70
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,159
right so instead of doing things in

71
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,319
software we do it in Gra graphical uh

72
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:06,000
workflows these are just drag and drop

73
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:08,400
blocks connect them by wires and that's

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,720
how we process data and this graphical

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,480
workflows can be uh deployed to

76
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,879
different locations because your data is

77
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,000
not necessarily all in the cloud right

78
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,040
they are on your RS production sites

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,159
they can be in your private private

80
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,200
Cloud so there's little there's this

81
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,280
little you know containerized data

82
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,159
engines that can run in all different

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,159
locations collecting processing all your

84
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,640
data then we can fuse all of them

85
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:36,799
together and that's how we build

86
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,720
Solutions much much faster and also

87
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,680
simpler than software development and I

88
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,319
think you know once you can do this you

89
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,319
can really accelerate how you can use

90
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,159
the data in your

91
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,680
organizations the other thing that we

92
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,280
focus a lot is optimization of the

93
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,400
computer architecture so once you scale

94
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,319
up there's two bottlenecks you're going

95
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,799
to face one of them is performance which

96
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,840
keeps getting worse as you process more

97
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,959
more data the other one is actually the

98
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,640
compute cost everybody knows how

99
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,760
expensive Azure and uh and AWS are so we

100
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,519
have to really optimize at the CPU level

101
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,880
in order to use every single CPU cycle

102
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,320
so that we can scale the solutions very

103
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,799
efficiently so let me give you example

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,520
of a solution this is what we call

105
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,400
operational digital twin solution for

106
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,600
drooling rcks with our partner Precision

107
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,520
droing one of the largest um droing

108
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,199
contractors in North America and what it

109
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,039
does does is basically monitor all the

110
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,000
drolling equipment like mud pumps top

111
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:37,960
drives generators and it uses a huge

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,800
amount of data right billions of data

113
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,880
points per day tens of millions 57

114
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,919
million database queries in order to to

115
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,680
generate those events it's already

116
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,800
deployed at over 100 RS and who uses

117
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,759
this it turns out it's not just the

118
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,400
field Ops when you have a really good

119
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,080
digital twin solution everyone uses it

120
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,520
and this is not a dream this is actually

121
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,400
how Precision uses today so from the

122
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,759
field Ops the rig managers to the remote

123
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,960
Ops team that use a lot of the

124
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,320
automation feature in order to very

125
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,520
quickly figure out what their problems

126
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,960
are over 100 rigs right so they can only

127
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,720
spend about two minutes per every rig to

128
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,919
fix issues so many many of the things

129
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,400
have to be automated and obviously

130
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,880
electrical engineers they look at the

131
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,600
the data to understand what's going on

132
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,080
um to data teams right generating bi

133
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,120
reports uh procurement CFO to look at

134
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,600
budgeting forecasting and even the CEO

135
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,080
gets a monthly report on what's going on

136
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,000
with the r how much how much spending

137
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,520
are happening so a good solution ties

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,080
all the different units together this is

139
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,560
something I want to show very quickly

140
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,160
this so how fast once you have this kind

141
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,880
of graphical te technology how fast you

142
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,160
can build Solutions the the the text is

143
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,880
a little small there but basically took

144
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,720
just two months for us to finish the

145
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,960
digital twin solution from the M mud

146
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,360
pump and another month to iterate with

147
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,639
two rig teams you cannot do that in

148
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,120
software ever and once the field teams

149
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,520
tell us what they want you know we we we

150
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,560
we get the solution you know implemented

151
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,039
within that one month time and then they

152
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,960
start to scale up and you can see we

153
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,120
start to add AI models we start to build

154
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,160
digital twin for the other equipment and

155
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:25,080
in a year it's over 50 rcks in a year

156
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,639
and a half it's over 100 rcks right so

157
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,240
this kind of you know development

158
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,160
framework is super fast and it gets a

159
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,199
field to get engaged in the solution if

160
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,039
they're engaged they're going to use

161
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,639
it so this is just the example screen of

162
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,520
a mod pump um um monitoring screen shows

163
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,800
you what happens to the pump what

164
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,919
components um are running to the close

165
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,639
to the end of life uh digital log G for

166
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,560
them to put in what components replaced

167
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,479
you know what issues they've seen those

168
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,080
data actually goes back into training

169
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:00,720
for the AI and there's also a very

170
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,080
interesting AI behind the scene you know

171
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,280
the field doesn't even know what

172
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,599
technolog is behind it why do they care

173
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,720
right they just wanted to get their job

174
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,479
done but they say I predicts every

175
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,639
single component lifetime issues from

176
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,360
the day you put them in to the day of

177
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,160
end of life right so it doesn't just say

178
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,080
oh now it's vibration something's going

179
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,000
to happen but instead the first day you

180
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,960
put it in it's going to tell you what's

181
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,840
is going to happen through its life and

182
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,319
uh so we build these large Solutions we

183
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,960
build them very quickly and uh if you're

184
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:36,520
interested come to see our technology

185
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,520
and our um uh demo thank you
