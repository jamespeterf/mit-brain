1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:02,711
I think I grew up thinking, "Oh my gosh,

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:03,920
we understand so

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,130
little about everything."

4
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,257
So there's just everything you can

5
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,051
discover. I really liked nature. Just

6
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,219
looking at, you know,

7
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,097
the plants and the bugs or anything, that

8
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,390
was really fascinating to

9
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,892
think about why that came about.

10
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,484
I'm originally from Japan. You know, I

11
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:29,946
grew up there and I got PhD there.

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,161
Something really formative for me was my

13
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,622
father, huge admirer of Albert Einstein.

14
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,584
He was always talking about finding the

15
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,127
truth and thinking about

16
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,795
the world and, you know,

17
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:49,591
the science. I'm totally imprinted about,

18
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,467
you know, doing

19
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,177
science and something really

20
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,597
sacred about doing science. That's how I

21
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,433
grew up. So for me, the

22
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,019
scientist is not a job.

23
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,439
There was a thing I thought, "Oh, that

24
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,940
would be super cool to be."

25
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,694
You know, looking back, my father never

26
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,071
tried to teach me anything.

27
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,740
He was really good at picking

28
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:18,995
where my way of thinking was unique. And

29
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,122
he goes, "Oh, that's such a really

30
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,082
interesting new idea,

31
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:25,752
a unique idea, a creative idea." And that

32
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,504
was kind of positive reinforcement.

33
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,090
Now I feel I can spot some really new

34
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,675
idea that's coming from

35
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,052
other people I can spot.

36
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,224
When I thought about going to the

37
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,142
company, I felt like that

38
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,936
was kind of suffocating.

39
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,898
I felt like at least if I go into

40
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,107
academia, I might have

41
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,108
intellectual freedom.

42
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,944
So I felt like that was

43
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,155
something I felt I couldn't give up.

44
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,158
And then, you know, by a few of those,

45
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,993
you know, accidental events, I end up

46
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,119
with doing a postdoc

47
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,206
at a Stanford. And in my probably, you

48
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,707
know, the second week, I

49
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,960
realized, "Wow, oh my gosh,

50
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:11,339
I feel like I'm breathing." And then,

51
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,049
well, then I realized,

52
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,968
"Actually, this is really fun.

53
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,596
I don't care in what form. I just want to

54
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,932
continue doing these kind of

55
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,976
things." Not being limited by

56
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:27,647
anything other than the actual nature or

57
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,400
myself, it was such a

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,860
liberating feeling, like,

59
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,236
"Okay, this is great."

60
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,408
I had visited MIT a few

61
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,410
times as a seminar speaker,

62
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,036
that kind of things. I like

63
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,706
like the way how people think. People are

64
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,957
really open to

65
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,043
unconventional ideas. You know, I have

66
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,629
had a few, you know, the MIT Underground

67
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,840
in a lab. I mean, that's just

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,342
how to say, they are amazing.

69
00:02:56,342 --> 00:03:00,763
You know, there's some distinct MIT

70
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,765
characteristics. In a good

71
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,893
way, people can't let go.

72
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,565
I'm really fascinated by, you know,

73
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,319
evolution. I went into some sort of cell

74
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,528
biology, developmental

75
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,740
biology, and then some evolutionary

76
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,035
aspect comes in. And I started feeling

77
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,202
like, "Oh yeah, I can do

78
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,413
that." Every day, I'm creating more

79
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,332
mystery than I answered.

80
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,045
I'm really looking forward to finding

81
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,755
more and more and more, right? I mean,

82
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,548
that feeling doesn't get old, I would

83
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,008
say. I think that's a really

84
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,218
great thing about being a scientist. You

85
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,261
live with a little bit of

86
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,429
delusion. Still, the most

87
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,097
important question I'm going to solve.
