1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,799
Uh now I'd like uh to join me in

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,720
welcoming Dr. Brandon Fields, co-founder

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,800
and chief science officer at Fieldstone

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,040
Bio. Fieldstone Bio creates

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,960
highresolution heat maps of targeted

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,440
elements through microscopic bioensor

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,039
signals. Welcome.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,800
>> Thanks for the introduction, Trisha. And

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,400
so again, my name is Brandon Fields. I'm

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,920
the chief science officer of Fieldstone

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,119
Bio. And today I'm going be talking

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,480
about how we're measuring Earth's

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,880
microscopic elements at mining scale.

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,920
And so just a bit about us uh field was

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,320
born out of MIT in 2023. I have a PhD in

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,320
genetics and I did my posttock in the

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,160
synthetic biology center at MIT under

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,320
Dr. Chris Voit who's one of the world

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,160
leaders in synthetic biology. And

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,559
together with Patrick Stone, we teamed

21
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,399
up to translate this technology being

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,399
done in the lab at MIT to solve some

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,239
real world challenges. And today I'll be

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,120
talking about aspects of this technology

25
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,280
we're applying to the mining industry.

26
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,520
And I really want to focus today on the

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,079
fact that uh data drives decisions in

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,160
the mining industry. For example, in the

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,400
exploration phase, trying to figure out

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,920
where to mine, right? Where are the

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,400
enriched metals underneath the surface

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,479
of the earth, right? Operations phase,

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,320
right? What materials to mine, right?

34
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,479
Deciding which materials are worth

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,960
proceeding with or not uh producing at

36
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,200
all. And then entailings management

37
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,720
right what are we leaving behind both on

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,479
the pollution side of what are the

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,320
pollutants that are being leeched in the

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,320
environment but then on the economic

41
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,240
side right where are the good minerals

42
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,520
that are still available right and be

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,759
able to purpos uh potentially remine

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,240
uh and so one of the key bottlenecks

45
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,360
right now is that this data is limited

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,600
and that's really based on the

47
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,920
technologies we have to generate that

48
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,159
data so the gold standard here is

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,399
lab-based analysis right methods that

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,560
are very specific specific but costly

51
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,560
and low throughput. So think of the

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,479
example in the exploration phase, right?

53
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,079
Taking core samples out of the earth,

54
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,320
right? And to get that specific

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,880
analysis, you have to do destructive uh

56
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,399
destructive uh lab-based testing where

57
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,880
you grind up some samples and send it

58
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,040
out for analysis, right? So not only is

59
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,119
that costly and takes time, but you're

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,039
really limited in spatial resolution.

61
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,800
You're only getting data for that

62
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,280
average signal across the region

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,120
measured. And then we think of the scale

64
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,480
of all these operations, right? The

65
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,560
exploration phase, they're taking

66
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,800
kilometers of core samples. The

67
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,720
operations phase, just all this material

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,800
and the tailings management, right? We

69
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,360
need technologies that can scale to

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,480
generate more high resol resolution data

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
across really large materials. Another

72
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,200
approach here is imaging based

73
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,720
approaches. And I use the term imaging

74
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,720
to cover an umbrella of different, you

75
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,560
know, spectral-based technologies,

76
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,160
right? These these do match that high

77
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,080
throughput need, right? where you can

78
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,000
generate lots of data across really

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,239
large scales, but they're not as

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,400
specific. Right? The challenge is it's

81
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,959
often limited to indirect readouts or

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,640
correlations with signals, right? And so

83
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,400
at Fieldstone, what we're working on is

84
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,720
a technology to uh combine uh the

85
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,560
sensitivity of lab-based analysis with

86
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,879
imaging based approaches to get the best

87
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,519
of both worlds.

88
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,800
And we do that using biology. And so I

89
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,640
love showing an image like this because

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,959
it highlights the scale of mining

91
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,360
operations. But I think about this on

92
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,280
the microscopic scale, right? In the

93
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,000
fact that nearly every surface of our

94
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,920
planet is covered in microbes, right?

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,879
Small organisms that cover these

96
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,680
surfaces and do tremendous biology.

97
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,440
Okay? And so uh in the mining example,

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,200
right, you have microbes. You may have

99
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,159
heard of biomining applications where

100
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,560
folks are using biology to extract

101
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,640
metals out. And this is because life has

102
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,400
found ways to interact with metals in

103
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,040
their environment contributing to the

104
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,599
geologies that we all talk about. And we

105
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,159
view microbes as these microscopic uh

106
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,360
computers, right? And so microbes have

107
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,799
evolved ways to sense and respond to

108
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,280
metals and other chemicals in their

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,239
environment to make decisions. Okay? And

110
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,799
so can we harness this uh aspect of

111
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,400
biology to be able to sense and report

112
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,319
on the minerals in our environment?

113
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,120
And so here's how we do that. We

114
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,680
engineer the actual DNA of the microbe,

115
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,920
right? To encode these sensing uh

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,080
programs, if you will, that are specific

117
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,560
to different critical minerals and

118
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,160
create an imaging based readout. Now,

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,079
this first part, engineering a microbe

120
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,759
to sense metals and other chemicals, has

121
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,440
been around for decades. That's not the

122
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,880
breakthrough here, right? Plenty of

123
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,400
people have demonstrated in labs you can

124
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,280
get microbes to sense and respond to

125
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,880
chemicals and produce responses. The key

126
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,440
bottleneck and why this hasn't been

127
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,199
applied in in the environment is how do

128
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,840
you visualize that activity? Right?

129
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,000
These little tiny microscopic organisms

130
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,160
typically you need heavy machinery or

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,520
microscopy based methods to see on their

132
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,160
scale. The key breakthrough for us is

133
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,720
creating an output when the micro senses

134
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,960
the metal that's compatible with imaging

135
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,800
based technologies such as hyperspectral

136
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,720
imaging, right? imaging technologies

137
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,280
that are already used in the field and

138
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,520
that could be put on uh on the surface

139
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,360
drones, planes and even satellites.

140
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Right? So, a way to visualize these

141
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,479
microbial sensors for the first time

142
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,720
from far away. Okay? Now, one of the

143
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,240
benefits of the microbial bioensors is

144
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,680
they're once we do the initial

145
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,600
engineering to build the sensors,

146
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,680
they're really cheap to produce. Think

147
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,759
of growing uh yeast for beer. It's the

148
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,000
same process. We can grow these up at

149
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,720
large scales to be able to meet the

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,800
scale required in the mining industry.

151
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,039
Microbes are also uh don't require any

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,600
electricity and they can sense metals at

153
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,039
parts per billion concentrations on

154
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,880
millimeter resolution with our

155
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,720
technology. So again, it's really

156
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,880
combining this idea of the uh

157
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,240
specificity of lab-based analysis with

158
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,199
the high throughput and spatial

159
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,280
resolution of imaging.

160
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,440
So how does this actually look? Right.

161
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,639
So on the left is one of our products

162
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,680
where we have a microbial bio sensor

163
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,000
that senses gold and specifically gold

164
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,479
and then turns on the reporter that we

165
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,080
can visualize with the cameras. Okay.

166
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,400
And in this case, this is an example in

167
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,280
the lab of a contaminated soil with gold

168
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,520
in it. And you this is just harvesting

169
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,600
the core sample and then spray our

170
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,840
microbial bio sensor over the surface of

171
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,160
the area and then we can image and

172
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,039
analyze within hours. So, we get data on

173
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,800
the same day. And by eye, when you look

174
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,400
at this photograph, you really can't see

175
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,560
much, right? You see the core sampler

176
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,720
and you see uh the material that we're

177
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,319
investigating, but there's actually

178
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
billions of these little tiny

179
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,199
microscopic sensors embedded in the

180
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,600
material. And so, when we do our imaging

181
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,319
with hyperspectral analysis and using

182
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,479
our AI algorithms to identify where the

183
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,319
microbe is sensing the chemicals, we

184
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,639
generate these heat maps like on the

185
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,440
right. Okay? So these heat maps are

186
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,080
showing where the microbe has identified

187
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,960
where the gold is and has translated

188
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,880
that signal into an easily identifiable

189
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,440
spectral signature that the camera and

190
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,759
our algorithms can identify. And it's

191
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,240
not only where but how much. So you can

192
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,240
see the heat map going from blue to red,

193
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,560
right? And how much of the intensity

194
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,039
scores there correlate with the gold,

195
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,000
right? So really showing that we can use

196
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,440
uh mic microbes to do rapid spatial meta

197
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,599
metal analysis on samples.

198
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,520
And so we're currently uh in in our lab

199
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,840
we've built microbial bio sensors for

200
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,440
gold, copper and arsenic. And we're

201
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,520
currently working with customers in all

202
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,440
these different areas. Right? So in the

203
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,639
exploration phase some of the ideas here

204
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,639
are early core analysis on site same day

205
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,319
analysis. And so we're not only

206
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,160
improving the density of data through

207
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,639
our tech to guide the drilling

208
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,720
decisions. Then you have the operations

209
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,319
phase, right? Blast fragmentation and

210
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,319
detecting concentration elements over

211
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,680
the surface and or grade control and

212
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,080
sorting support chemical decisions

213
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,400
during the milling process. And then on

214
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,160
the tailing management side, right, it's

215
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,639
can we detect shifts and changes in the

216
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,400
tailings for the bad chemicals or metals

217
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,720
that we we don't want being leached in

218
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,280
the environment, but also the good ones,

219
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,440
right? Is there uh good gold or copper

220
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,759
or other metals in these piles to be

221
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,080
able to repurpose them and mine them?

222
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,479
And again, it's taking our technology to

223
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,080
generate this type of data at scale

224
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,560
required to drive all of these

225
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,840
decisions.

226
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,960
And with that, thank like to thank

227
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,160
everyone for the time and happy to take

228
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,360
any questions.

229
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,440
>> Thank you so much. Fantastic

230
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,160
presentation, Brandon. Um we do have a

231
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,120
few audience questions that we can um

232
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,400
get to. for interested companies. Is

233
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,879
there a way for you to demo your

234
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,319
technology on their materials?

235
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,240
>> Oh, yeah, definitely. So, one of the

236
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,919
things we like to talk especially with

237
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,000
some of these unique applications, bring

238
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,000
customers into hearing their pain points

239
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,159
and seeing how our technology can be

240
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,120
applied across the different areas

241
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,039
because like I said, once we've

242
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,320
engineered the micro uh there's some

243
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,720
specifics to applying to different

244
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,880
materials and things like that. Um, but

245
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,399
really it's up to uh different ways the

246
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,680
users can take advantage of this and

247
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,600
we're really excited to hear what people

248
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,440
have. And the way we start with that is

249
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,880
having uh folks send us these materials

250
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,320
and do these demonstrations and then

251
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,399
scaling up from there.

252
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,160
>> Excellent. Well, that's great. Great to

253
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,000
hear. And what are other metals you are

254
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,440
developing sensors for?

255
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,560
>> So, currently in our pipeline, like I

256
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,200
mentioned, we have the gold, copper, and

257
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,839
arsenic. Uh we have short-term uh goals

258
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,160
to build malibdinum and silver as well

259
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,839
as into the rare earth metals. Uh but

260
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,000
again, one of the things we offer

261
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,519
customers is as we're talking uh finding

262
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,680
out what they're interested in building

263
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,519
and building sensors specific to those

264
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,160
problems.

265
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,480
>> Excellent. And one last question. Um

266
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,959
what is the what is the limit of

267
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,279
detection for these microbial sensors?

268
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,839
So what levels of the metals can you

269
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,680
sense?

270
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,200
>> Great. Yeah. So in in our our testing,

271
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,360
we can get down to parts per billion

272
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,279
sensitivity. Um it varies, you know,

273
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,040
between the specific metals, but uh it's

274
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,399
in that range. And one of the reasons I

275
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,000
highlight this is, you know, we're

276
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,600
taking the fact that nature's already

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,920
doing this, right? And so life has

278
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,920
evolved to deal with the metals in these

279
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,519
all these samples I talked about, right,

280
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,440
at their natural levels, right? And so

281
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,279
we're just harnessing that ability. Uh

282
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,120
really showing how we can get real world

283
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,320
sensitivity.

284
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,920
>> Excellent. Well, thank you again,

285
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,440
Brandon. It was wonderful to have you

286
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,720
and feature you and thanks again for the

287
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,279
talk. Y

288
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,279
>> Thank you.
