1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,930

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,290
Welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,050
I want to thank you
for joining us today

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,820
for what will be a
terrific conversation

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,890
with our esteemed guest,
Professor Esther Duflo,

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,860
here at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,880
We'll hear from Dr. Duflo about
her groundbreaking research

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,320
and approaches to
poverty alleviation.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,760
And we'll also talk in
depth about her teaching

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,980
and how sharing teaching openly
through MIT Open Learning,

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,820
and more broadly, has had
a transformative impact

12
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,540
on the lives of people at
MIT and around the world.

13
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,690
I'm Chris Capozzola.

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,770
I'm our Senior Associate Dean
for Open Learning here at MIT.

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,400
And this is the second event
in the Open Conversation series

16
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,080
that Open Learning hosts, that
focuses on how Open Learning can

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,940
empower people to improve
their lives, communities,

18
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,310
and the world.

19
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,850
And our special guest today
is Professor Esther Duflo.

20
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,250
And I have the pleasure
of introducing her.

21
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,270
And her accomplishments
are many,

22
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,129
and her achievements
are phenomenal.

23
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,190
I will just briefly
introduce you to her

24
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:08,590
as a researcher and a scholar.

25
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,710
Dr. Duflo is the Abdul
Latif Jameel Professor

26
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,680
of Poverty Alleviation
and Development Economics

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,690
here at MIT.

28
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,050
She's the Co-Founder and
Co-Director of the Abdul Latif

29
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:25,180
Jameel Poverty Action Lab, and
Chair of Pauvreté et Publique

30
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,980
at the College de France.

31
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,700
In her research, she seeks to
understand the economic lives

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,590
of people who live in poverty,
with the aim of designing

33
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,130
and evaluating rigorously
social policies for poverty

34
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,160
alleviation.

35
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,320
She's worked on health, on
education, financial inclusion,

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,660
environments and
sustainability, and governance.

37
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,250
And she has been the recipient
of numerous academic honors

38
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,390
and prizes, many of which
are what probably encouraged

39
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,600
you to log in here today,
including, of course,

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,240
the 2019 Nobel
Prize in economics,

41
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,020
which she shared with
co-laureates Abhijit Banerjee

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,759
and Michael Kremer, a John Bates
Clark Medal, and the MacArthur

43
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,260
so-called Genius Fellowship,
to name just a few among many.

44
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,620
She's the author, most recently,
of the prize-winning book Poor

45
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,190
Economics, A Radical
Rethinking of the Way to Fight

46
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,980
Global Poverty, which I
encourage you to check out.

47
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,750
And near and dear to
our heart here at MIT,

48
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,270
she is a dedicated and
innovative teacher,

49
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,590
not only here on our campus in
both graduate and undergraduate

50
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,130
education, but in conjunction
with Open Learning,

51
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,680
where she shares her teaching
with tens of thousands

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,330
of learners worldwide.

53
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,380
So what we'll be doing
for the next hour

54
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,590
is talking back and
forth with Dr. Duflo.

55
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,930
We're going to hear
some of her passions

56
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,530
for teaching and learning, some
of her insights and thoughts

57
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,580
right now about
poverty alleviation

58
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,320
and challenges in economics
as practiced in the world.

59
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,528
And we'll be bringing in
questions from our audience.

60
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,278
Some of those are
questions that have come

61
00:03:04,278 --> 00:03:05,580
to the audience ahead of time.

62
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,270
And some are ones that
you can continue to offer

63
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,290
if you're watching this live.

64
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,200
So I'm going to just start
off by giving you the floor.

65
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,100
And I'd love to just hear
a little bit about you

66
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,480
and what inspired you to
take this path for research

67
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,720
and to focus on
economics, public policy,

68
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,340
and really using data to
advance poverty alleviation.

69
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,510
First of all, thank you.

70
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,770
Thank you all for being
here online and in person.

71
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,930
I know there are so
many things happening

72
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,530
at the end of May on campus that
it's pretty phenomenal that you

73
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,100
made it here.

74
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,750

75
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,820
Most people, I think,
find a field of study,

76
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,010
and then they look for a topic.

77
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,325
And I went the other way.

78
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:56,340
I had a topic, and then I had
finally found the field of study

79
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,240
that would fit to that topic.

80
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:06,300
So from really an early age, I
was very exposed to the notion

81
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,140
that there are poor people
around in the world--

82
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,390
poor kids, when I was a kid, I
was more interested in kids--

83
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,860
that had circumstances that
were widely different from mine.

84
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,220
Part of it because my
mom was a pediatrician,

85
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,260
and she had an
office in the city.

86
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,670
But she also was very
involved in an NGO

87
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,930
that was working with
children victims of war.

88
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,900
In fact, the country where she
spent a lot of her time working

89
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,960
is now very much in the news
because it's El Salvador.

90
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,110
But before that, she went
to many other countries.

91
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,150
And she would come back
and show us slideshows

92
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,860
of what she had seen.

93
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,470
And it kind of struck
me that these children,

94
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:02,450
just because they were
born in the wrong country

95
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,380
or in a different
set of circumstances,

96
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,440
had a life that was so
much harder and probably

97
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,180
so much more
circumscribed than mine,

98
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,970
with so little opportunities.

99
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,860
So I always thought,
this is a gigantic debt

100
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,220
that I have to the world.

101
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,020
Maybe it was somewhat
self-aggrandizing to think

102
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,520
that way.

103
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,180
But this is really how I thought
about it when I was little.

104
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,980
And I have to devote
my life to repay

105
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,270
that debt of the
incredible cosmic luck

106
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,930
that I have to be born in
the middle class in Paris,

107
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,902
as opposed to in the
Sahara or in the DRC

108
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:51,860
or something like that.

109
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,130
So it always stayed with me.

110
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,170
And for the longest
time, I really

111
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,930
didn't know how to put
that into practice.

112
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,030
And I followed the path
of least resistance

113
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:14,890
of a good student in France,
studying for exams and so on.

114
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,640
As a matter of fact, I thought
I would be a historian.

115
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:26,950
And came a time, somewhere
in the middle of college,

116
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,670
where I felt that I was
really so protected,

117
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:36,430
and I had a life that was so
comfortable, both intellectually

118
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,845
and physically.

119
00:06:38,845 --> 00:06:42,320
I lived in this wonderful
dorm in the center of Paris.

120
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,150
I was paid to study.

121
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,070
I had the best friends.

122
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,130
And we had classes,
like seminars,

123
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,870
with five people
in them and so on.

124
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,720
And it was like, I'm
making no progress

125
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,410
in repaying my cosmic debt.

126
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,280
And it made me a little jittery.

127
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,260
So I decided I have
to change my path.

128
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,540
And so I thought, maybe I
should go into politics,

129
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,670
because I would have
a more direct impact

130
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,210
on the life of people.

131
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,600
But I was a little suspicious
that they would like it,

132
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,840
because I don't
really like shortcuts.

133
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,150
So I thought, OK, let me just
take a step back and move

134
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,610
country and figure
out what I can do.

135
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,740
And it turns out my school
had an exchange with Russia.

136
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,410
So I was like, I'll go
to Russia for a year.

137
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,280
And I went to Russia for a year.

138
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,280
And I was teaching French
in a university there.

139
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,820
And by some really totally
accidental reasons,

140
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,775
I met two economists.

141
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,650
One of them happened to
be a professor at MIT

142
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,780
at the time, Thomas Piketty.

143
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,550
And the other was a
professor back in my college.

144
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,810
And through them, I got
in touch with many people,

145
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,550
many economists in
Russia at that time.

146
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,440
This was the middle
of the transition,

147
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,590
so people were very busy.

148
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,290
And I watched what
they were doing.

149
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,720
They plugged me in to be a
research assistant and so on.

150
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,600
I spoke Russian,
so I could be more

151
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,990
or less useful despite
knowing no economics.

152
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:22,070
And I watched with
a mixture of dread

153
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,840
and being very
impressed what they

154
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,350
were doing, because I thought
they have a tremendous amount

155
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,320
of influence.

156
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,880
And they were
academic economists,

157
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,020
many of them from Harvard, who
were advising the government.

158
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,059
And they were really
making major decisions

159
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:44,000
or having their finger on
major decisions on the basis,

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,083
I thought, of not
very much knowledge,

161
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,250
because it's not that anybody
had a lot of knowledge

162
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:52,180
about how to radically
turn the ship.

163
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,890
But I thought, OK, this is it.

164
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,050
I can go back to my cosmic debt.

165
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,710
I'm going to learn
economics, and then I'm

166
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:03,040
going to be able
to, as an academic,

167
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,350
have influence,
maybe, on the way

168
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,820
that economic
decisions are being

169
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,630
made that concerns the poor.

170
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:15,290
So with that plan hatched in
Russia, went back to France.

171
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,180
I had to basically cram five
years of economics into one

172
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,590
so that I could then
apply to graduate school.

173
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,370
And then I came to MIT and
started working on this problem.

174
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,330
So I came here.

175
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,420
I think it was incredibly
lucky in a way,

176
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,430
because I think for
many PhD students,

177
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,600
after they are done
with their classes,

178
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,520
they are a bit fumbling
around, figuring out what

179
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,360
they should do research on.

180
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,730
And I was on a mission.

181
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,020
I still am on the mission.

182
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,782
That's the same one.

183
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,812
That's fantastic.

184
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:48,180
It's great to hear that
story, and I think also

185
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,890
for many people who start their
learning journey not knowing

186
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,660
what intellectual tools will
solve the problems that they

187
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,180
want to do.

188
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,900
And that's a great story.

189
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,720
Let me talk about you
becoming a teacher.

190
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,770
So what inspires you
in the classroom?

191
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,940
What do you get
most excited about,

192
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,090
whether it's an in-person
classroom on campus

193
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,780
or when you're teaching online?

194
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,520
So in the story
that I tell, there

195
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,700
are really these powerful
professor figures.

196
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,530
My professor from France,
his name was Daniel Cohen.

197
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,640
He recently passed away.

198
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,640
He was an amazing
teacher in the sense

199
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:40,080
that he was able to connect
quite complicated concepts

200
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:49,460
to real-world situations and
make them speak to each other

201
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,170
in ways that were
really remarkable.

202
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,700
And he was also a great
exponent of writing

203
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,615
excellent popular audience
books for the same reason.

204
00:10:58,615 --> 00:11:02,180

205
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,020
And that was, of course,
very important in my decision

206
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,910
to switch to economics, because
in the course of working

207
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,920
for him, I had
really the occasion

208
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,912
of hearing the way
he was talking.

209
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:19,110
And of course, at various
other moments in my life,

210
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,150
I was exposed to
wonderful teachers.

211
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:27,800
So it's pretty essential
to I think the--

212
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,600
people meet many,
many people, I'm sure,

213
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,200
who are able to pinpoint the
one teacher in their life

214
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,990
or the several teachers in their
life, either in grade school

215
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,050
or in high school or in
college, that made a difference.

216
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,710

217
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,750
Teaching at MIT
and teaching online

218
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,230
is, of course, a very
different ball game.

219
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,560
It's a different objectives.

220
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,050
The MIT students
are amazingly sharp.

221
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,420
And especially, I
teach a freshman class,

222
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:07,230
which I really love to teach
because I assume that nothing is

223
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,960
known and that
it's a blank page,

224
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:17,460
but that there is no concept
that you cannot bring.

225
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,450
And I think this attitude, I
try to take to all my teaching

226
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,630
and my writing, whether
it's at MIT or online,

227
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,250
is to never, never, never assume
that the person in front of you

228
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,800
is not ultra sharp
and ultra smart

229
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,560
and can't understand
what you're telling them.

230
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,150
So anything can be approached.

231
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,900
And in fact, in
France, you mentioned

232
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,290
my teaching gig in France is
kind of an on and on teaching

233
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:42,840
gig.

234
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,460
It's totally open.

235
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,800
There are 2,000 people
in the auditorium.

236
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,730
Most of them are above 70,
and they have never done

237
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,210
economics in their whole life.

238
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,790
And I teach them the same
thing that I teach at MIT.

239
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,290
Nice.

240
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,620
But not in the same way.

241
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,890
Nice.

242
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,010
So it's really lovely to teach
to MIT students, undergraduates

243
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,340
or graduate students.

244
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,910
The undergraduates, what I
like or love with the freshmen

245
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,230
also is I teach a
communication intensive class,

246
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,980
so I make people talk and
prepare things and get engaged

247
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,230
with really practical problems.

248
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,700
And they are delighted to
have a chance to speak up.

249
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,220
So it's very nice to
give them this space.

250
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,530
But it's very few people.

251
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:31,380
So when I first got introduced
with OpenCourseWare,

252
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,550
I was really excited.

253
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,300
I was like, oh, oh,
we can put what we do.

254
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,592
But of course, at the very
beginning of OpenCourseWare,

255
00:13:36,592 --> 00:13:37,880
they just put the class notes.

256
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,800
So it's not as interactive.

257
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,750
Then I first got
the chance of taking

258
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,750
video tapes of my
undergraduate freshman class

259
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,680
to put on OpenCourseWare.

260
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,360
And in the first minutes
it put, so many people

261
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,530
get to watch the videos.

262
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,040
And you're like
oh, this is great.

263
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,530
This is more people than I
will ever teach in person.

264
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:08,650
And when MITx came on, and
we could use the same video

265
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,130
to structure something more,
with deeper engagement,

266
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:18,400
I was even more excited by that,
because I felt I can basically

267
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,180
now almost teach the same way.

268
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,210
The MIT students that
I teach in person

269
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,970
watch the same video
as the online people,

270
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,190
and basically take the class.

271
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,770
And then they come to class and
they do something else with it.

272
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,170
And the people in the world,
they watch this video,

273
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,980
and presumably, they are also
used in a part of their life

274
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,420
that's a different part.

275
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,860
But the core is the same.

276
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,440
And then the spokes are
different in different parts

277
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,050
of the world.

278
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,740
And I think that's very
powerful in the sense

279
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,800
that I don't think the
people who are on MITx

280
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,300
get a less good version.

281
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,020
They just get a
different version.

282
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,787
Yeah, no, that's crucial.

283
00:15:03,787 --> 00:15:05,370
And a lot of the
learners have told us

284
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,770
that they really value
the idea that this

285
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:11,755
is the exact same thing that MIT
students on campus are getting.

286
00:15:11,755 --> 00:15:13,380
That's literally the
same, because they

287
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,240
watch the same video.

288
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:23,340
And from time to time, we
teach the lecture again

289
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:28,740
to the MIT students so that
the class gets updated online

290
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,400
and for the MIT students.

291
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,940
So they can be sure that
what is being taught online

292
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,960
is really the frontier of what
we think the students would

293
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,350
know if they were here.

294
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,130
Yeah, so as if that
weren't enough,

295
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,720
then you went a step
further and have

296
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,520
developed a program,
the MicroMasters

297
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,830
program in DEDP,
Data, Economics,

298
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,960
and the Design of Policy.

299
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,458

300
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,750
Some of those learners are
probably watching right now.

301
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,570
But for those who don't
know much about it,

302
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,100
tell us about it
and how it works

303
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,480
and your reflections on that.

304
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,650
Yeah, so this is a
program that we--

305
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,660
I mean, it's one of the
things that I've done at MIT--

306
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,380
maybe one of the
top three things.

307
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,400
And I don't even know what the
other two are, that I'm, A,

308
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,760
the happiest I have done and
the most proud I have done

309
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,810
and the most grateful
that that possibility was

310
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,738
offered to me, because,
frankly, it was a bit of--

311
00:16:34,738 --> 00:16:38,080
we were all learning.

312
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,910
Open Learning people, from
engineers to leadership,

313
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,950
and us at the same
time, when we were

314
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,290
trying to build this program.

315
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:56,230
So the gamble of
this program was

316
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:02,800
if we can select people
to come to MIT based

317
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,480
on what we want them to
do once they are at MIT,

318
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,837
we would be able
to completely break

319
00:17:12,837 --> 00:17:15,650
the mold of
traditional admissions,

320
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,750
admit an entire different set of
people who would probably never

321
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,890
have made it to MIT,
and they would do great.

322
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:28,580
So this was really the
core of the gamble.

323
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,210
How you make that work is
by having the equivalent

324
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:38,850
of one semester worth of upper
level undergraduate/master's

325
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:44,770
classes online through
the MITx classes.

326
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,840
So for us, there
is now a choice.

327
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,330
But there is probability
and statistics,

328
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,520
there is development economics,
or there is microeconomics,

329
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,110
there is public policy, and
so on, political economy.

330
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,800
You have a bit of a choice,
but of five classes,

331
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,150
which people can either do in
one very dense semester if they

332
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,840
want to.

333
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,960
Some people do that.

334
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,810
But most people
take while they are

335
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,850
doing something else on the
side, one by one or two by two.

336
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,440
And then we admit
students to spend

337
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,590
one semester at MIT based almost
exclusively on how well they

338
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,890
do in these classes.

339
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,740
I'm saying "almost exclusively,"
because we get their info and we

340
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,540
are also paying a lot of
attention to what they write,

341
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,910
why they want to come, what
people write about them,

342
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,120
what are their experiences.

343
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
But that way, we don't
need to worry so much

344
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,900
about trying to understand what
their grades might be or might

345
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,400
mean.

346
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,430
Or you don't need to
have gone to college.

347
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:52,510
One of our most
successful students

348
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,600
had not graduated high school
when he applied to our program.

349
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,620
And he's now in the PhD at
MIT, having never completed

350
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,230
an undergraduate degree.

351
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,660
Another person had gone
to college in Mexico,

352
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,960
but he, due to various
difficulties in his life,

353
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,260
never managed to finish college.

354
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,160
But he did great in the classes.

355
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,820
We admitted it.

356
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,170
He graduated with his program.

357
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,920
Today, he's working at the OECD.

358
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,830
Another person who is here
this year is from Somaliland

359
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:27,570
and had left Somaliland a grand
total of once to go to Kenya,

360
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,640
but had worked in UNHCR
with refugees and so on,

361
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,860
and managed to take all
the classes and so on.

362
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,470
So it's really an
amazingly diverse group

363
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,820
of people in terms
of their experiences,

364
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,150
what they bring to
the table, and so on.

365
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,210
But what have in common is,
number one, extraordinarily

366
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,560
drive, because to finish the
pretty hard classes online

367
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:55,860
from Somaliland, it takes
more than grit, double grit.

368
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,430
And number two,
of course, the raw

369
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,680
cognitive skills and firepower
to be able to do this.

370
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,370
And so the first
part of the gamble

371
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,500
of having a much more
diverse class, like 100%.

372
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,160
The second part of the
gamble, when they came to MIT,

373
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,220
we now have several cohorts.

374
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,930
They are systematically the
best in the classes they take,

375
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,200
both when they take master's
level, like [INAUDIBLE] level

376
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,400
classes or upper level
undergraduates, which are also

377
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,010
cross-registered master's
students, and even in PhD

378
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,050
classes.

379
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:36,020
That's because they bring
in a thirst for knowledge

380
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,200
that none of our
other students have.

381
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,610
The undergraduates,
god bless them,

382
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:48,060
are a little blasé, trying to
check as many boxes as they can.

383
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,890
The PhD students tie
themselves into knots

384
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,680
wondering what is going to be
helpful for their dissertation.

385
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,940
And our master's
degree students,

386
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,910
they just are
delighted to be here.

387
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,550
And they want to take
the most out of MIT.

388
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,900
And they do.

389
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,390
And they contribute so
much to the classes.

390
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,750
And they change the energy
and the dynamic of the class.

391
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,810
Everybody loves them,
in our department,

392
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,290
to have them in the class.

393
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,330
So I think it's
really been amazing.

394
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,015
And again, it wasn't obvious.

395
00:21:19,015 --> 00:21:21,570
We had to shepherd it
through the process,

396
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:24,320
get it approved in
the faculty committee,

397
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,940
and every step,
people were like,

398
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,590
are you sure this can work.

399
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,540
Of course, we're not
sure it can work.

400
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,965
We certainly hope.

401
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:36,590
But it's really
been a huge success.

402
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:40,420
When they come, we tell them
they have to change the world.

403
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,470
That's the only reason
why we took them.

404
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,550
And that's the
metric of success.

405
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,610
And now they really
are busy doing that.

406
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,690
That's awesome.

407
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,390
That's really awesome.

408
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,770
I love that metric of success,
of changing the world.

409
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,900
But let me drill down
on that one actually

410
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,410
a little bit, because in the
field of economics, of course,

411
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,790
you're very well known,
famous for demanding

412
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:10,090
rigorous measurement
of policy outcomes.

413
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,960
So how does that shape your
approach to learning outcomes?

414
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,280
And how have you used
some of those insights

415
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,840
from your research methodologies
to think about metrics

416
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,530
of success for the
DEDP, MicroMasters,

417
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,410
or even just for
individual courses?

418
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:33,450
Well, I have to admit,
not so much in the sense

419
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:37,380
that we know what I do for
a living as a development

420
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,330
economist to set up
randomized control trials,

421
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,180
so to have treatment and control
that are randomly selected.

422
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,860
And we've never done
that with the DEDP

423
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,080
in any way, shape, or form.

424
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,095
We take the best students.

425
00:22:52,095 --> 00:22:55,060
We take only 20 students,
25 students every year.

426
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,640
We take the people
whom we think are

427
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,450
going to make the most of MIT.

428
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,460
And we have no scope to
randomizing, so who knows.

429
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,140

430
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,150
So in that sense, I
don't have a proof

431
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,440
that the DEDP is
making a difference.

432
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:20,330
But what I can see is
what they do moving ahead,

433
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,915
the positions where they end up.

434
00:23:22,915 --> 00:23:24,290
This is really
what interests us.

435
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,180
The grades are
important, because it

436
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,720
shows that they fit in MIT.

437
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,150
And as I was telling you, the
distribution of DEDP students

438
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,350
creates stochastically dominate
that of non DEDP students,

439
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:42,170
correct, so that's interesting,
in terms of the selection

440
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,910
being successful.

441
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,150
But what is even more important
is what they do later.

442
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,667
Some go back to their
country where they came from.

443
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:51,500
Some go back to the
industry they came from.

444
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,330
Many shift or go elsewhere.

445
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,670
Some work in international
organizations.

446
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,040
And we are in contact with
pretty much the entire network.

447
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,720
And I do know that they--

448
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,250
everywhere.

449
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,260
The type of institution
that welcome

450
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,430
them always tell us to send more
or do you have more like that.

451
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,180
And we do.

452
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,890
Every year, we have
one more cohort.

453
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,210
Yeah, that's great.

454
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:23,830
And here's a question
you may get sometimes

455
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,770
from all kinds of
learners or people

456
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:30,730
who are outside of
economics and looking in.

457
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,400
And some of your courses--

458
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,100
and I can say this as a
learner, some of your courses

459
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,530
are really hard
and very demanding.

460
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:46,150
So when someone is
struggling, either to begin

461
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:52,426
to learn economics or
to complete a course,

462
00:24:52,426 --> 00:24:56,200
how do you get them motivated
and keep them motivated?

463
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:04,360
So there are two ways
to answer this question.

464
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,130
One is a little
glib, but I'm going

465
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,960
to start with that,
which is we started

466
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,235
at that pretty high level.

467
00:25:09,235 --> 00:25:12,440
We are started at the level
of a master's program at MIT.

468
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,960
So it's not going to be easy.

469
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,680
Mm-hmm.

470
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,750
I'll surprise you.

471
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,680
Yeah, yeah.

472
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,410
I had a textbook in
macroeconomics that said,

473
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:28,880
some say it's enough to have
high school mathematics to learn

474
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,300
economics, but it would have to
be a pretty good high school.

475
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,836
So it's a little
bit the same here.

476
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:37,540
It is what it is.

477
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,210
We can't at the same time say,
after this and coming to MIT,

478
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,773
you will be at the top of your
class, and say, by the way,

479
00:25:44,773 --> 00:25:45,690
it's going to be easy.

480
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,690
So in the sense,
that's a program

481
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,970
that's for people who are
reasonably prepared and very

482
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,340
committed.

483
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,270
So that's the glib answer.

484
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,010
And then part of me feels
that therefore we should

485
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,550
have a lot of scaffolding.

486
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,030
And I'll come back to
the scaffolding part

487
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,080
in a moment, which is fine.

488
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,670
You can end there,
but you should

489
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,590
start so that you can bring
more people to that level,

490
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,170
knowing that it's not going
to be like the whole world.

491
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:21,230
But in a sense, our book
doesn't bear [INAUDIBLE].

492
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,930
It's not particularly
massive, nor is it

493
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,746
maybe destined to be massive.

494
00:26:25,746 --> 00:26:28,045
It's relatively
advanced material.

495
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:33,470

496
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,540
So that's the glib answer.

497
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,370
Now, the less glib answer is,
how do we do the scaffolding.

498
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:44,610
So part of it is happening
within the course itself.

499
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:49,610
So for example, say if the
probability and statistics--

500
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,460
for example, you take
the data analysis class,

501
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,850
it starts from probability
and ends at machine learning,

502
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,770
starting with probability
from the foundation.

503
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:05,900
So in a sense it doesn't
have many prerequisites

504
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,230
as long as you are
tightening your belt

505
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:13,690
and ready to stick,
with the exception of,

506
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,750
for the data analytics
exercise, you need

507
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,830
to be able to use the software.

508
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,640
And then, for that, we
prepared a lot of modules

509
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,030
that people can do
before so they can--

510
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:27,030
before they even
start, so they have

511
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:30,960
time to familiarize themselves
with R is the language we use.

512
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,370
And they'll get help to do
that and a lot of tutorials.

513
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:36,400
So by the time they launch the
class, they have that in place.

514
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,520
And we have a lot
of community TA

515
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,810
on the platform that help out.

516
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:48,120
So that's the within
platform help.

517
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,790
And then, I also realize
that for a lot of people

518
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,480
it's not enough, and yet
a lot of people who could

519
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,720
succeed if they got more help.

520
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,050
I also know that
only very few people

521
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,000
will be able to come to MIT,
because MIT is not that big.

522
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,050
So we won't be able to expand
the program infinitely.

523
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:17,100
So for these two reasons,
what we've engaged in,

524
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,370
in the last couple of years,
is an effort called ADEPT,

525
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,440
where the A is for Alliance.

526
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,510
And it's now trying to
form a network of schools

527
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:33,630
that will use the DEDP
material, the DEDP courses,

528
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:39,690
as a corpus in a way,
in different ways.

529
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,340
And one of the ways in which
they can use it is they

530
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:50,040
can take the online classes and
teach them as flipped classroom,

531
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:55,430
using their time in class to
reinforce, help out, et cetera.

532
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:58,850
So for example, we are doing
that, one of our ADEPT nodes

533
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:05,825
is the statistical school
in Cote d'Ivoire, ENSEA.

534
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:08,840
Their advanced undergraduates
can take our all classes,

535
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,070
and they get support.

536
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,730
Right.

537
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:19,160
And at the end of the class,
they validate the MIT class.

538
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,170
And eventually--
it's not quite done,

539
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,930
but we are moving
towards the fact

540
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:27,170
that they'll also get credit
for that class at ENSEA itself.

541
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:30,190
So this ADEPT is now
what we are trying

542
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:35,770
to create in a lot of places,
including replicating the MIT

543
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:40,540
model so that there would be, as
the pipeline grows of people who

544
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,540
have taken those classes,
there'll be outlets for them

545
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,130
to go to.

546
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,550
So ENSEA is going to start its
own master's degree in Brazil.

547
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:52,010
We just launched at Insper.

548
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,350
They are going to start
their own master's degree.

549
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,820
Princeton is now going to admit
into their master's degree,

550
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,060
students who have finished the
MicroMasters, and so on and so

551
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,700
forth.

552
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,900
So in a sense, the idea
there is to use the material,

553
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,990
not just like, this
is here in the world,

554
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,305
if you can swim, swim,
otherwise you sink.

555
00:30:12,305 --> 00:30:15,750

556
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,020
Yeah, that's fantastic.

557
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,740
And in some ways, all of that
gets back to your comments

558
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,830
at the beginning,
right, about thinking

559
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:27,110
that anyone that
you meet and talk to

560
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:31,540
has the capabilities to
engage with this material,

561
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,486
even if they may not have
had the prior preparation.

562
00:30:35,486 --> 00:30:45,264
So in moving
forward, I would like

563
00:30:45,264 --> 00:30:50,910
to start earlier, which is,
there are many kids who,

564
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:56,850
say, for example, very talented
kids who don't get to the level

565
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,430
where they would even
hear of this program,

566
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:04,270
or they don't have the math
that's necessary, and so on.

567
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,610
And I would like to make sure
that those kids are not lost,

568
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,420
or fewer of those kids are lost.

569
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,060
So one of the projects
I'm working on,

570
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:17,720
it's in Tamil Nadu in
the South of India.

571
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:24,110
We work with AoPS, the platform
of very advanced math classes

572
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,030
that many MIT students
take as enrichment.

573
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:30,710
And they gave us a
bunch of licenses.

574
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,030
AoPS stands for Art
of Problem Solving.

575
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:37,340
And it's many, many online
classes, very good level.

576
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:42,090
They gave us access to licenses
that we can give to the kids.

577
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,770
And we are engaged this time in
a randomized controlled trial,

578
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:49,190
where we give out
those licenses to kids

579
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,860
in the middle of nowhere,
in rural Tamil Nadu,

580
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:56,850
or on the country, in a
slum, in urban Chennai,

581
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:04,930
and see whether they manage
to do well in the classes

582
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,890
and do better in
their coursework,

583
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:11,110
but more importantly,
get into STEM

584
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,390
and so on, whereas
otherwise, they

585
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,000
would have been giving up
school even though they

586
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,290
are super talented.

587
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,690
So that's one other way to
take this problem is saying,

588
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:27,010
well, we can lift the boats
a little bit in advance

589
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,170
so that more people
would be able to get

590
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,820
into our program or
any other, really,

591
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,950
that would start at the
more advanced college level.

592
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,520
So eventually, there is
maybe a whole pipeline.

593
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,550
Right, that's fantastic.

594
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,260
All right, so what
I want to do now

595
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,420
is switch to some
of the questions

596
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,760
that we've had
from our audience.

597
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,250
And what I'll do is I'll
be asking a few questions

598
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,490
that we got in advance.

599
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,700
And sometimes I'll be
bringing together questions

600
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,460
from people who asked
very similar ones online.

601
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,360
Most of these are questions
people asked ahead of time.

602
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,260
Some of you will be
providing questions

603
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,040
if you're watching online live.

604
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,380
And we'll be sure to get
all of these questions

605
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,490
to Professor Duflo.

606
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,730
And some of them, we'll
be able to answer.

607
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,830
But there's already
more questions

608
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,473
asked than we can ever get to.

609
00:33:14,473 --> 00:33:16,140
So let me just start
with the first one.

610
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,460
And many of them actually
focus on your research

611
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,830
in economics and
poverty alleviation

612
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,960
and what it means to
do that now in 2025.

613
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,900
And then we'll switch
back to some questions

614
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,350
about teaching and learning.

615
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,340
But here's a question.

616
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,540
And this combines ones
from Corinne and Ulises

617
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,260
and Joe, that works out
to something like this.

618
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,480
What are some of the
consistent obstacles

619
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,560
in alleviating poverty?

620
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,080
And how can technology,
funding, and public policy

621
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,440
play the most effective role
in overcoming those obstacles?

622
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,800
This is a question I'm sure
you think about every day.

623
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,930
This is that motivation
question you talked about

624
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:54,420
at the beginning.

625
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:54,960
Absolutely.

626
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,770
So I think the
biggest obstacle is

627
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,940
that a lot of
people whose job it

628
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,050
is to do this,
like policymakers,

629
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,350
but also people in NGOs,
activists, and so on,

630
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,310
are extraordinarily
well intentioned.

631
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:12,070
But the believe they know
significantly more than they do.

632
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:17,560
So people launch
into massive programs

633
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,500
on the basis of very little
evidence and a lot of goodwill.

634
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,860
And a lot of these things
end up falling flat.

635
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,630
Mm-hmm, or worse.

636
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,540
Or worse.

637
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:35,260
So that's why I spent a lot
of my energy trying to--

638
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,310
a related problem
is that most people

639
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:45,010
feel that there is one answer to
the entire problem of poverty,

640
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,409
which of course makes very
little sense because it's

641
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:50,380
so many different, different,
different problems.

642
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,679
It's the equivalent of saying,
there is one drug for cancer.

643
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,860
That's just not how
it works in poverty.

644
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,762
Likewise, there are
issues with education.

645
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:00,970
There are issues with health.

646
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,400
There are issues
with the environment.

647
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,460
And they are all
different problems

648
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,940
that we can take one by one.

649
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,610
So that's why a
lot of my work is

650
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:13,140
to really try to convince people
to say, OK, OK, let's relax.

651
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,790
What's really your
ambition in this program.

652
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:20,310
Maybe it's ending
poverty, but closer to us.

653
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:24,480
What's the immediate
outcome that you seek?

654
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,270
And what are the various
ways that you could seek it?

655
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,100
And what's the most
effective, what

656
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,040
are you sure about,
what should we try out,

657
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,890
including different
versions of the same thing,

658
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:41,200
because often the devil
is really in the details.

659
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,860
So I think the biggest obstacle
to poverty is what we--

660
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,200
with Abhijit Banerjee,
in Poor Economics,

661
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,286
we call the three Is, which is
Ideology, Ignorance, Inertia.

662
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:56,360
Mhm, OK.

663
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,820
Yeah, all right.

664
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,060
And a follow-up
question on that,

665
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:07,820
is that how do
the obstacles vary

666
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,640
in different parts of
the world, whether that's

667
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,460
different countries
or regions or even

668
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,730
within a country, urban
areas versus rural areas?

669
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,440
Are there patterns you see?

670
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,950
Or are these just fundamental
obstacles to the tour?

671
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:31,310
The problems are very different,
often, depending on the context.

672
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:37,670
For example, if we think about
health, a problem in rural area

673
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:41,270
might be that people are quite
far from a health facility.

674
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,920
A problem in an
urban area might be

675
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,290
that they are
thousand of doctors

676
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:51,110
within a space this size,
but none of them is any good.

677
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:54,610
So those are different
problems that

678
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,210
require different solutions.

679
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:58,420
So the problems can
be quite different

680
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,840
in different countries,
in different contexts.

681
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:13,480
Some of them, you can find
commonalities across problems,

682
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,920
but the approach always
remains the same,

683
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,850
which is being open-minded
and curious and experimental

684
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,040
and willing to be wrong.

685
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,790
Mm-hmm, OK, another
question, this

686
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:30,490
is actually somewhat of a more
teaching focused question.

687
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,950
But it can also affect many
areas that you work in.

688
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,850
So this combines
questions from three

689
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:40,450
of our viewers, Jose
Maria, Danielle, and Zarif,

690
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:46,330
who want to understand how
sharing educational resources

691
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,630
can affect change.

692
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,230
So in some ways, it's bringing
these two together, right.

693
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:53,940
Is this kind of teaching
part of poverty alleviation?

694
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,290
And also, what are some of
the challenges in context

695
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:03,180
or settings where things like
electricity and internet access

696
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,210
are really limited?

697
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:11,350
So let me take the two halves
of the question separately.

698
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:15,810
So yes, I think the
teaching, and in particular,

699
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:20,430
this Open Learning, and then
the branching out to ADEPT

700
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,740
is a critical part
of the effort,

701
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:28,930
because I'm just one person.

702
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,160
I'm going to, I don't
know, maybe write,

703
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,500
if I'm very productive, a
hundred papers in my life.

704
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,890
I actually have no idea.

705
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,170
But that's not very many.

706
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:44,500
And in fact, when we
got the Nobel Prize,

707
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,760
that's immediately what we
said is that that's not for us.

708
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,360
This is for the movement.

709
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,470
This is for all
of the people who

710
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:55,910
are doing this work of trying
out one thing after the other,

711
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:58,370
both the people who are
in the field implementing,

712
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,560
the researchers,
who are running it.

713
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:08,660
So very early on, actually,
almost the minute I

714
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,150
started teaching at
MIT, I was convinced

715
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:19,850
that what we needed to do is to
not just run trials, but set up

716
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,980
an infrastructure to make it
easier for others to do it.

717
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,580
Otherwise, it would remain
a completely niche activity

718
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,360
that would have no impact
beyond very few people.

719
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:35,010
Hence J-PAL, which
basically, from the get-go,

720
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:39,030
it was, let's start a network
of people who do this at MIT--

721
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:44,600
not an MIT, in the whole
world, to put in common lessons

722
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,470
about how to do things or not
to do things, infrastructure,

723
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,500
recruiting research assistants,
money raising, and the like.

724
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,850
And J-PAL has been quite
successful at creating

725
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,300
this network effect.

726
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,910
So there are now a thousand
researchers all over the world.

727
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:05,940
And together, the research
is so much more powerful.

728
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,610
And it had affected
quite a few people.

729
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:11,430
The current number
is 600 million people

730
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,980
who have been affected, not
directly by the research we run,

731
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:20,280
but by programs that have
been scaled up after we

732
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,800
found them to be effective.

733
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,670
But it's still not
enough, by far.

734
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,170
And many more people need
to be able to do this work.

735
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,440
And many more
policymakers need to be

736
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,180
able to understand
it and understand

737
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,890
why they need to do it.

738
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,530
And that needs to be
really distributed better

739
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:44,040
geographically, because although
technically our thousand

740
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,270
researchers are all over
the world, in practice,

741
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,820
there are still many
in the US or in Europe.

742
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,750
But the work needs to
be done everywhere.

743
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,625
When there is poverty
in the US, so some work

744
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:54,870
needs to be done in the US.

745
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,850
But the work needs to
be done everywhere.

746
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:00,110
And although, of
course, I feel perfectly

747
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,100
capable of doing
research in India,

748
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,340
it's even better if I have
an Indian co-author that

749
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,220
can do it with me.

750
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,020
Or in fact, it would be
great if teams made entirely

751
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,530
of Indian researchers
could have the wherewithal

752
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:16,110
to figure out the project,
find the money, and so on.

753
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:20,000
And for that, we need
many more people trained,

754
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,960
because it doesn't
happen just like that.

755
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,830
It cannot happen by Fiat, said
go find yourself a collaborator

756
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:31,670
in Benin if nobody's
learning economics in Benin.

757
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:38,460
Hence, the really key part
of J-PAL 3.0, if you want,

758
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,980
is to be able to network,
not just the infrastructure

759
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,510
of research, but
the infrastructure

760
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,490
of teaching, such
that people can

761
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:51,640
be trained to do
this type of work

762
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,930
from the point of view
of being a researcher

763
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,080
or being a policymaker,
or being an activist

764
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,600
or working in a company,
everywhere in the world, which

765
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,880
is why our ADEPT, we
started with Cote d'Ivoire,

766
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,320
we're going to Brazil.

767
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:14,990
Now we have several
places in Europe as well.

768
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,780
We need to be all
over the place.

769
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,660
Yeah, that's fantastic.

770
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,160
And then, just on
that second half,

771
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,980
what do we do with
that last mile?

772
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,460
Yeah, it's a really
important question.

773
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,970
So for example, in the
case of the Art of Problem

774
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:34,180
Solving project, we
realized pretty early

775
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,050
on it was going to be an issue.

776
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,650
We didn't think so because
network connectivity

777
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,130
is very good in Tamil Nadu.

778
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,040
Electricity is not bad.

779
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,300
And we thought students mostly
had access to a smartphone.

780
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,503
But then we realized
that they have access,

781
00:42:49,503 --> 00:42:51,420
but they don't really
have access in the sense

782
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,966
that maybe it's their father's
phone, the father is away,

783
00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:58,090
then can't have
access to the phone.

784
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,450
So we realized if this
program was going to work,

785
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,936
we needed to give them tablets.

786
00:43:03,936 --> 00:43:05,190
And we did.

787
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:11,500
And that makes a huge difference
to this basic infrastructure.

788
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:16,440
So the good thing is that
this is only improving.

789
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:19,440
Most of Africa, the
expansion of cell phone

790
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,050
has been something quite
phenomenal, and most of Africa

791
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:26,920
is covered by cell
phone connectivity.

792
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,710
So this barrier will
progressively be less and less.

793
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,330
And we're pretty
confident of that.

794
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:34,440
But for example,
electricity is a huge need.

795
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,570
One of the key need of
many countries in Africa

796
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,920
today, where the poor
have very little access.

797
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,090
Yeah, so this is
another question

798
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:50,030
that came from multiple people
in different angles, which

799
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:55,290
is, many are admirers
of your work,

800
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:57,620
both your academic work
and the work that that

801
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:01,190
does in the world, and
are just wondering,

802
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:04,320
what are the challenges
you're facing in 2025,

803
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,000
in a complicated global
environment where you're

804
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,880
adjusting to many different
contexts, constraints,

805
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,170
and policies, of course,
here in the United States,

806
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,970
but really, around the world?

807
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:21,860
And just how has that shaped
your thinking and also

808
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,443
your practice?

809
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:25,340

810
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:32,450
How much time do you have so
that I can list a my issues?

811
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:37,380
Well, it's been a pretty
wild ride with, of course,

812
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,340
the shutting down of USAID
within days of inauguration.

813
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:47,650
We had quite a bit
of USAID funding.

814
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,650
So many projects got cut midway.

815
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:56,590
And to date, a lot of
the bills for past work

816
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,100
haven't even been paid yet.

817
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,320
So that creates all
sorts of issues.

818
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,320
We are assuming that there
are going to be paid.

819
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,636
We want to believe
in the rule of law.

820
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:10,510
And of course, as you
say, it's not just the US.

821
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,760
It's in general.

822
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,350
So in France, for example,
the foreign cooperation budget

823
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:23,920
has also been cut in about 35%,
in Germany, as well, in the UK,

824
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,220
about half.

825
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,440
And within that, except
for France, I have to say,

826
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,140
where they really preserved the
research wing of the development

827
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:35,830
assistance.

828
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,750
In other places,
it's the first thing

829
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:41,350
to go because at the same time
as you cut the total volume,

830
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:45,090
there is also a need to
reorient towards priorities,

831
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:48,060
like either people
literally starving because

832
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,050
of the end of USAID,
or Ukraine, because

833
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,150
of the end of the
support to Ukraine.

834
00:45:54,150 --> 00:46:01,222
So from the point of view
of funding for our work,

835
00:46:01,222 --> 00:46:05,340
it's not the easiest
time, by far.

836
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,250
Not to mention that we
are within a university,

837
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,230
and in particular,
elite universities.

838
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:14,020
And those universities
are also under attack.

839
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:21,030
And as part of them, we also
suffer the indirect consequences

840
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:23,490
of that as well.

841
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:29,230
So it has immediate
implication of day-to-day life,

842
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:31,680
what can be funded, what
can be done, and so on.

843
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:37,356
At the same time, I don't
think it really anything

844
00:46:37,356 --> 00:46:41,860
to the reason why I'm doing
what I'm doing, because aid is

845
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:45,680
like a microscopic amount was.

846
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,120
Now it's even more microscopic.

847
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,990
You really need a special
physics microscope to see it.

848
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,890
But even before that, it
was a pretty small part

849
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:57,610
of the amount of money that was
spent on the poor worldwide.

850
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:00,070
Most of the money that is
spent on the poor worldwide

851
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:05,876
is the money that is being
raised by those countries.

852
00:47:05,876 --> 00:47:08,500

853
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:13,300
And so they used to spend
their money and a little bit

854
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:14,930
of USAID money.

855
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,820
And now they spend
only their money.

856
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:22,000
Even before, I was mainly
interested in making sure

857
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,370
that the entirety of the
budget of these countries

858
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:27,790
is spent in the most effective
way possible to serve

859
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:32,900
their own priorities of each and
every one of these countries.

860
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,690
So I never really saw myself
as having much to do with aid.

861
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,190
I now realize that I had more
to do with aid than I thought,

862
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,250
because I was financially
dependent on it for my work.

863
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:48,300
But that's my problem.

864
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,790
The fact is, my
work was and still

865
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:55,440
is relevant to my customers, who
is not the US government, who

866
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,350
is not the French government,
but who are the people who

867
00:47:58,350 --> 00:47:59,850
live in these countries.

868
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:05,290
And yeah, so we'll find other
ways to make ourselves useful.

869
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,820
When I started doing
this type of work,

870
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,900
USAID was funding zero research.

871
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,120
And the NIH was not funding
any international development.

872
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,540
So it's not that we had money.

873
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,810
We scrambled.

874
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:23,400
So now we are back into a bit
more of a scrambling world.

875
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,520
But hopefully, the fact
that in the meantime,

876
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,340
I think the attitude in many
of the developing countries

877
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,330
has really changed in
terms of pragmatism,

878
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,840
in terms of identifying the
problems they really care about,

879
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,010
in terms of trying solutions,
learning from other experiences,

880
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:44,820
and so on.

881
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,930
So we can continue at
least sharing evidence,

882
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:52,460
trying to generate evidence
locally, and find a way

883
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:54,830
to finance this one
way or the other.

884
00:48:54,830 --> 00:49:01,440
So it's going to change
maybe my time allocation,

885
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,920
but I don't think
it changes really

886
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,800
anything to what I need to do.

887
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:16,940
And in a sense, I
mean, the US shouldn't

888
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:20,180
have to inflate the image
of its own importance

889
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,280
in the rest of the world.

890
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,055
Maybe after some time they'll
realize, everybody is moving on.

891
00:49:25,055 --> 00:49:27,930

892
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:31,430
Yeah, and that motivating
mission that you talk about,

893
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,660
that debt that you started
at the beginning, that's

894
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:34,660
something you're still--

895
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,618
That's very much there.

896
00:49:35,618 --> 00:49:38,785
And in a sense, it's
still very, very important

897
00:49:38,785 --> 00:49:41,290
to know for the kids--

898
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:43,580
say, for the kids
of Tamil Nadu, where

899
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,310
the government of
Tamil Nadu wants

900
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:49,870
to know whether giving them
access to apps with tablets

901
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,680
makes a difference
to their learning.

902
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,070
And if it does,
they'll find a way

903
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:56,820
to finance the
program down the line.

904
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:00,730

905
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:03,220
Yeah, that's a really
important message

906
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,850
that I think people looking
in from around the world,

907
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:10,960
and looking here at MIT and at
American universities right now,

908
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,130
will really value
that message from you.

909
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:17,590
I think what it will
do is to accelerate

910
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,480
the realization, which was
already coming anyways,

911
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,550
that finance is a
little irrelevant,

912
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:31,260
and that the northern
country were punching

913
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:36,540
above their weight, given
what they were giving

914
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,790
and the influence
they had in exchange.

915
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:40,720
And think now that they
are giving nothing,

916
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,910
they are going to
get no influence,

917
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:43,785
and then they are going
to feel sad about it.

918
00:50:43,785 --> 00:50:45,670
But people would have moved on.

919
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:51,960
Mm-hmm, OK, so we've talked
about you as a researcher

920
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,640
and as a teacher.

921
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,470
And now it's time to talk
about you as a student.

922
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,345
And so we are all
lifelong learners.

923
00:51:00,345 --> 00:51:03,570
So what's something
that you don't know now

924
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:06,450
that you want to learn next?

925
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:09,891
Oh, so many things.

926
00:51:09,891 --> 00:51:13,650
I always try to pick
research projects that

927
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:20,070
are a little just above my
current frontier of what I know.

928
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:22,860
For example, I wanted
to teach myself

929
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,560
a lot of statistics and
econometrics and machine

930
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,660
learning, so I
started doing projects

931
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,220
on the econometrics
of experiment,

932
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,600
not knowing really
much about it.

933
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:41,060
And so I was very excited
to learn this material.

934
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:42,720
And I'm continuing to do that.

935
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,600
So I have more econometrics,
too, and statistics to learn.

936
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:53,040
And now I'm very
interested, by force,

937
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,170
because this is such an
important issue looming

938
00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:00,240
in our lives, about
climate change,

939
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,640
because in the next few
decades, that's really

940
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,000
going to be the defining
feature for many

941
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,130
of the poor countries, which
also happen to be hot countries,

942
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,550
and therefore, where
the warming will have

943
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,510
a disproportionate influence.

944
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:21,560
So a lot of my
advocacy job is really

945
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,670
about compensating poor
people for climate change

946
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,910
that they haven't
caused, but they are

947
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:31,240
bearing the consequences of.

948
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,830
And that I can do, in a
sense, with what I know.

949
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:39,630
But there is so much to
learn about this whole field.

950
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:41,380
Much of it is in
economics, but some of it

951
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:46,090
is in many other fields, about
how one models climate change

952
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:48,020
and what we think
is going to happen,

953
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:52,700
and thinking about the subtlety
about determining the effect,

954
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,520
how we think about how
people are going to adapt.

955
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,300
And so that's
another big things.

956
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,560
Then, nothing to
do with economics,

957
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,500
I used to play a lot of
music when I was a kid.

958
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,100

959
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,910
And then I stopped coming to
MIT, actually, as a PhD student,

960
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:12,980
until through college
I played music.

961
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,910
And then I stopped, because
well, I played cello,

962
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:18,220
and I didn't have money
to bring the cello,

963
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,300
because you need to pay
a seat to the cello.

964
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,370
And I don't know.

965
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:23,463
I didn't think that
I could rent one.

966
00:53:23,463 --> 00:53:24,380
It didn't occur to me.

967
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:26,110
But I really also
had no money at all.

968
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:29,160
So anyways, so I stopped
playing music at the time.

969
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,580
And now my kids
are playing music.

970
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,030
And they are
becoming quite good.

971
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:37,500
So I feel I need to
relearn to play music.

972
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,885
That's another thing that's--

973
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,510
it was in the back
of my mind, but it's

974
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,030
moving towards the front.

975
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,590
That's fantastic.

976
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:47,970
That's really great.

977
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:51,540
Any final thoughts or words,
advice to our learners

978
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:55,050
about what to do next?

979
00:53:55,050 --> 00:54:04,652
Well, I think
finding any course--

980
00:54:04,652 --> 00:54:05,860
of course, this is my course.

981
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:06,520
I'm very happy.

982
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:11,550
But any course anywhere,
physics or math

983
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:15,816
or literature or
language, anything

984
00:54:15,816 --> 00:54:20,940
you enjoy, and try to stick
till the end of the course

985
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:26,320
is what I would advise,
because a lot of people start,

986
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:30,340
but then life overtakes.

987
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:36,310
But I feel this is when you
manage to go above that step,

988
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:41,600
that suddenly the
perspective really opens.

989
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,980
So it doesn't really
matter what people do

990
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:48,850
or whatever strikes
your fancy, but just try

991
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:50,540
to really, really stick with it.

992
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:54,260
And I don't know if
it's borne by data,

993
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,290
but my intuition is
that once people manage

994
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:59,770
to finish a course, the
next one and next one

995
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:03,860
becomes much more
easy and natural.

996
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,570
And there is such a
big world out there,

997
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:10,710
and the quality is so
excellent that [INAUDIBLE]

998
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,160
make the most of it.

999
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,960
And know that if you finish
the DEDP program, for example,

1000
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,580
or another of the
MicroMasters program

1001
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,280
offered, and you do
come to MIT, you'll

1002
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,540
have so much to
bring to this campus,

1003
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:29,130
and you will get so much
from it, that it will

1004
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:31,830
be transformational both ways.

1005
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,460
Amen, well, thank you.

1006
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:36,450
On that note, just a
huge thanks to you.

1007
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:38,745
And good luck with
the cello lessons.

1008
00:55:38,745 --> 00:55:42,030
And we definitely will be
expecting a concert performance

1009
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,790
next year, all right.

1010
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:48,540
And so, just to thank also
our viewers who are joining us

1011
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:49,590
online.

1012
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:52,790
This has been really an
inspirational conversation.

1013
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:55,110
And we want to thank
you for tuning in

1014
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:59,470
to listen, and encourage you
to share what you learned here

1015
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:03,220
with colleagues, with
friends, with your networks

1016
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:06,870
on social media and elsewhere,
and share your experience

1017
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:10,320
and your own story as a
learner, and as someone

1018
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,720
engaging with MIT's
Open Learning resources.

1019
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,570
And of course, we also
ask for those of you

1020
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:17,970
who are in a position
to do so, to consider

1021
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:21,260
donating to support our
efforts and to support

1022
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:25,430
the work of your fellow
learners and the impact

1023
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:29,540
that MIT and colleagues
such as Professor Duflo

1024
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,480
can share with us.

1025
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,380
So until our next
conversation, happy learning.

1026
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,490
And thank you for being with us.

1027
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:39,090
Thank you so much, not
only for this conversation,

1028
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:42,300
but on behalf of MIT
and Open Learning,

1029
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,540
for making this
possible, because I

1030
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,440
think it required an amount
of imagination that's

1031
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,710
quite remarkable.

1032
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:56,810
And also, it requires
a day-to-day dedication

1033
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:00,780
and dogged hard work that you
guys online might not realize,

1034
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,280
but I can assure you is there.

1035
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,690
So thank you so much for
persisting to this and for all

1036
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:10,640
the people who were involved
in this effort, with whom it's

1037
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,510
always been a pleasure
collaborating.

1038
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,530
Thank you.

1039
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,990
[APPLAUSE]

1040
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:19,000
