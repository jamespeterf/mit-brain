1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:05,160
from the MIT energy initiative this is

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,640
what if it works a podcast looking at

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,980
the energy solutions for climate change

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:13,050
I'm Cara Miller and I'm Rob

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,050
[Music]

6
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,359
Stoner so we talk a lot on this show

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,640
about different technologies that can be

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,519
used to create or store or distribute

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,920
clean energy but we probably don't talk

10
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:29,519
enough about the fact that in order for

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,520
any of that science to take effect a

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,879
thing usually has to be put somewhere in

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,680
some community and that involves

14
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,960
discussion it involves negotiation and

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,200
not infrequently it involves Larry

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,360
cesk I am in the middle quite often I

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,000
play the role of mediator cesk kind is a

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,559
professor of urban and environmental

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,239
planning at MIT and he's the publisher

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,520
of the public interest technologist he

21
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:00,199
says the story tends to go something

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,600
like this a developer has an idea for

23
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,199
renewable energy project he thinks

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,360
people are going to be thrilled about

25
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:10,119
this project and he's got a business

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,240
plan mostly he's aiming at getting a

27
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:16,920
permit from the state sighting agency

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,119
but he does usually have to go through

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,119
some local review so he needs to have

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,079
all the answers that are going to come

31
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,360
to the questions that he's asked at

32
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,759
these hearings so he hires really

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,479
expensive

34
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,159
Consultants many of them not from the

35
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,399
country that he's from who are working

36
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,360
from Air photo materials I mean the

37
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,040
consultant may never have been to the

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,520
site but they're preparing a detailed

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,000
plan for how on that 3,000 Acres there

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,520
going to be a wind farm or a solar

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,600
facility I'm guessing you can already

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,399
see the problem and The Clash that's

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,079
about to come somebody locally will

44
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:07,520
stand up and say did you guys look at a

45
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:10,360
map when you picked this site do you

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,080
know that you're proposing this in an

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,760
endangered habitat that's on a map that

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,319
EPA caused us or the department of

49
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,080
interior caused us to put together you

50
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,400
had several thousand acres that you were

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,680
considering and you put the proposed to

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,519
put this

53
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,800
there and the developer turns to their

54
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,760
consultant they rais their shoulders I

55
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,920
don't know what they talking about and

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,599
at that point Who's ever running the

57
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,000
local or state review process says uh we

58
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,319
need a break so you might have hundreds

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,720
of people sitting in a room susine says

60
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,720
just waiting and the business people

61
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,760
have quietly already bought land because

62
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,400
they didn't want the price to get bit up

63
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:02,319
in anticipation of a big industrial

64
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,720
project in Europe Europe the government

65
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:10,040
has a plan for where energy production

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,959
needs to be located and increased and

67
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:17,519
it's related to where you're going to

68
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:21,159
hook the local facility into the larger

69
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,319
Energy System here these are all private

70
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:26,080
individual private judgments someone

71
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,439
says I think I'd like to do a wind farm

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,920
I think I'm going to need about 3,000

73
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,080
Acres I guess that means they won't be

74
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,720
in the suburbs I'll probably be more in

75
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,280
the rural area well certainly won't be

76
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,200
in the city I need a lot of acreage and

77
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,799
so they shop around they talk to some

78
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,599
people they come up with a plan in

79
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,519
detail so that they can assure their

80
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,280
investors that we we have a legitimate

81
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,680
plan and we're going to get a license or

82
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,640
a permit and we're following all the

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,280
rules and we've commissioned an

84
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,599
environmental impact study and

85
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,239
environmental impact law says you're

86
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,680
supposed to have a public discussion

87
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,640
about what aspects of impacts you're

88
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,840
going to study and how uh that doesn't

89
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,920
always happen with energy facilities

90
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,519
because once again there's really no

91
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,239
interest in letting the community know

92
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,880
so you're setting this up in the context

93
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,960
of what sounds like a first public

94
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,160
encounter where the the developers

95
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,360
trying to get this done everything's

96
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,759
been secret until then or it's been

97
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,759
controlled by a Communications company

98
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,680
that they've hired and they're about to

99
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,440
announce this and they announce how

100
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,960
wonderful this new facility is because

101
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,759
it's going to help with the energy

102
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,800
transition and we promise they say we

103
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,600
will meet all the minimum requirements

104
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,000
environmental and otherwise by local law

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,400
and state law and federal law and uh

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,240
what percentage of the time would you

107
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,880
say that this kind of thing comes up at

108
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,880
you know your local town meeting or

109
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,280
whatever and they say this is here's the

110
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,919
plan we're going to have a we're going

111
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,120
to have a whole bunch of solar panels

112
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,560
out in this field here and we haven't

113
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,639
really talked about it before now

114
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,400
because as you said we don't want to

115
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:11,560
drive out the price of land but this is

116
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,720
the plan and it's going to be great what

117
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,840
percentage of the time does the do the

118
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,120
people in the town meeting say sounds

119
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,560
good to us never

120
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,840
okay because they haven't been given

121
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,840
enough information right the one thing

122
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,039
they say above all else is let us see

123
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,400
the plants they're not for or against

124
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,479
anything at that point they're just

125
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,400
saying uh it's kind of weird that you're

126
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,479
talking about something at a scale

127
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,199
that's going to change our whole

128
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:43,479
community and you haven't shown that to

129
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,759
anybody have you shown it to the elected

130
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:50,160
officials and not the public and

131
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:53,160
conceivably they have but mostly they

132
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,360
use someone a straw to go in between to

133
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,840
talk to the the the head of whatever

134
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,160
board the local zoning board and say uh

135
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,400
you guys aren't against

136
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,720
renewable energy facilities are you so

137
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,240
they say well it looks to us and we

138
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,599
looked online and we heard that there's

139
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:15,240
all kinds of problems for people who

140
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:17,199
live near wind farms like the the

141
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,039
shutter effect that thing is going round

142
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,759
and round and at night uh they hear it

143
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,960
and they can't sleep and they have

144
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,800
headache we've read this we know this

145
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,120
because you can find whatever you want

146
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,680
uh on the internet

147
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,599
and the developer says oh we've chosen a

148
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,240
distance that's best

149
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:41,759
practice and they said well like what if

150
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,160
it turns out that this really makes our

151
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,440
house

152
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,240
unsellable if we want to move right it's

153
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,120
our single biggest investment in our

154
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,000
lives buying this house are you are you

155
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,000
going to buy it at the current market

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,599
value before the horrible things happen

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,120
that you're causing um well no U we're

158
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,639
not required to do that and then

159
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,000
somebody else says well like how many

160
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,599
jobs are going to be created during

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,039
construction and after Construction in

162
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:13,560
terms of this facility and they have a

163
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,280
exact number how many of those are

164
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,440
reserved for people who live in the town

165
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,360
now oh well we Pro we'll consider all

166
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,199
good applicants no no but you you're

167
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,120
you're not going to guarantee that these

168
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,319
permanent jobs or how many people are

169
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,319
going to move here during construction

170
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:33,720
or after and how many kids are they

171
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,879
going to add to the school system and

172
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,840
what taxes are you going to pay anyway

173
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:43,360
like are you going to pay an industrial

174
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,039
property type taxes and they say things

175
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,360
if they're in New York state they say

176
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,800
things like well we're going to make a

177
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,080
payment in lie of taxes and those

178
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,360
initials are pilot we're going to have a

179
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,080
pilot agreement and it's going to start

180
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,199
with we don't owe anything because it's

181
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,720
great

182
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:05,840
for us to be building this here as part

183
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,879
of your Economic Development they said

184
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,919
but what how is it help our Economic

185
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,360
Development you're putting this thing

186
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:17,319
out here in the rural area so the people

187
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,800
in the city can have green electricity

188
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:24,039
and maybe at a few cents a kilowatt less

189
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,639
right what do we get out of it do we get

190
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,680
free electricity in our community oh no

191
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,120
no no we don't we don't do anything like

192
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,360
that well why should we support this

193
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,800
what's one

194
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,680
reason it it stands to create

195
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,039
environmental impacts because we have no

196
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,959
evidence that it

197
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,600
won't it's going to prop affect property

198
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,000
values in the area and various kinds of

199
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,399
ways and we might lose all the value of

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,279
the largest investment that we have what

201
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,360
water are you going to use during

202
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,160
construction or after does that come

203
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,279
with the land I'm never going to be a

204
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,480
developer so how do you resolve this I

205
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,560
mean You' got all these they're going to

206
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,120
buy all the houses I'll skip making the

207
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,800
whole list it's a very long list of

208
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,720
potential costs right the big rigs on

209
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,360
there local roads and all this yeah you

210
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:20,040
you yeah I I it's a long list of

211
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,800
potential right adverse impacts and the

212
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:27,120
developers not

213
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,040
responsible for those impacts unless

214
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,120
they somehow exceed

215
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,839
minimum State not local state

216
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,040
standards and you can't know that so you

217
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:43,600
have a study done a forecast and the

218
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,360
forecast doesn't have the data that it

219
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,360
really needs you know about making

220
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,440
models it so you you you plug in some

221
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,760
realistic numbers from some other

222
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,839
counties and near buy and you make a

223
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,120
model and you forecast and you say uh

224
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:04,240
we're doing everything possible to cre

225
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:09,200
to meet minimum standards now all of

226
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,440
that story says that the prevailing View

227
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,720
and policy in

228
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,079
America

229
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:21,279
is if the gains to the gainers outweigh

230
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,440
the losses to the losers it's good

231
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:28,720
public policy you should go ahead too

232
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:31,800
bad for the losers the whole region is

233
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,480
going to have have stable renewable

234
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:39,279
energ stable price renewable energy for

235
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:42,480
at least 30 years and that's so it's a

236
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:46,160
small amount times a million people in

237
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,320
the region there's like 30

238
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,600
landowners in this tiny rural

239
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Hamlet one of those bad things might

240
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,240
happen to them but um hey you got to

241
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:03,399
break some eggs if you want

242
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:06,800
to bake and uh they say but that's not

243
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:09,760
fair why should we bear the cost for the

244
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,399
region well we're not breaking any

245
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,440
minimums so if you step back here it

246
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,839
sounds like you're describing a

247
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,000
situation obviously you see a lot but is

248
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,200
it also a situation that ultimately ends

249
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,839
in things falling apart often that the

250
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,399
person comes in and says I want to do

251
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,399
this and it like does not happen we we

252
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,600
last year did it 58 case studies of

253
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:36,440
community controversies over renewable

254
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:41,360
energy facilities in the last five six

255
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:45,920
seven years across from Hawaii to Alaska

256
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:49,079
to Maine to Puerto Rico um I would say

257
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,560
right now we're down about

258
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:54,839
20% of the megawatts that could be

259
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,519
running if the projects that had been

260
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,360
planned and financed have been able to

261
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:05,720
go ahead all of them and there's energy

262
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:08,519
to do it except that people in the group

263
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:12,440
that are adversely affected

264
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:14,560
and people who will side with them

265
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,839
because of the

266
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,959
unfairness not letting them know until

267
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:22,199
after the decisions are basically made

268
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,279
not compensating them for likely losses

269
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:27,920
not mitigating adverse effects as long

270
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,279
as you meet minimum standards that the

271
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,120
state sets people side with them and say

272
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,639
well I'm in favor of renewable energy I

273
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,120
want to do something about climate

274
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:41,560
change but this not fair they're right

275
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,320
to say it's not fair now very quickly so

276
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,320
fast forward to what gets this problem

277
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,160
resolved very

278
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,160
simple hold harmless anybody local who's

279
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,800
adversely or likely to be adversely

280
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,760
affected as part of the cost of planning

281
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,240
and implementing the facility what does

282
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,360
that mean pay them it it it means offer

283
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,240
contingent compensation should buy

284
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,199
property value insurance for them you

285
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,160
won't lose your property value I didn't

286
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:10,040
you have a $200,000 house they don't

287
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,800
know what's going to happen it does fall

288
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,000
to 100,000 it's okay they're protected

289
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,079
it's like they never they it's like the

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,920
property Val you get what would have

291
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:21,360
happened if this facility had not been

292
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,760
built in that market okay that's just

293
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,079
one example they could say we're going

294
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,560
to make you 5% owners of the facility

295
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,279
this town and you're going to get less

296
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,720
expensive electricity as long as you

297
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:34,440
live in this town this much below what

298
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,320
everybody else in the region is being

299
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,040
paid you could make them part owners and

300
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,440
then they would be represented amongst

301
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,040
the stockholders not just the

302
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,440
stakeholders at the annual meetings if

303
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,600
they didn't think the place was being

304
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,639
run properly and they would bring that

305
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,199
local perspective you could have and

306
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:58,399
this is my primary focus these days a

307
00:13:54,199 --> 00:14:02,639
community benefits agreement signed with

308
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:05,839
the local Government after there was a

309
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,160
facilitated or mediated negotiation with

310
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,639
representatives of all the relevant

311
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,800
parties not decided by the development

312
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,600
who was relevant and they

313
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,720
negotiate and reach an agreement that

314
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,920
becomes a binding contract when it's

315
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,000
signed by the municipalities and

316
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,040
submitted by the developer along with

317
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,199
their application to the state

318
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,880
regulatory agency so you're describing a

319
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:31,720
process that's very very different from

320
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,680
what you set out for us initially there

321
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,079
is this initial confrontation right but

322
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,480
what we found is in the places where

323
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:42,519
projects were stopped and the developer

324
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,880
went bankrupt and they sold their rights

325
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:47,600
to build a facility to a next person

326
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,079
what's the first thing the next person

327
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,440
did let me sit down with all the people

328
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,560
who are upset with my predecessor and

329
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,519
make sure I tend to all those problems

330
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,560
and then the project can go forward let

331
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:02,040
me fix this process in the way the

332
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,519
bankruptcy had to have happen first yeah

333
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,720
it's not a mystery have the discussion

334
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,360
before you have the confrontation yeah

335
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,959
rather than make the

336
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:14,560
confrontation the regulations

337
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:17,040
changed to require it and also it it

338
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,160
sounds like even though initially

339
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,519
developers might be reluctant to say

340
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,320
well I'll help you get insurance on your

341
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,560
home or I will make you a part owner

342
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,360
I'll help this community benefit it

343
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,759
sounds like in General you must not

344
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,120
think that extra $100,000 here or there

345
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,720
is going to bankrupt the developer

346
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,839
because you're saying like hey get out

347
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,279
in front of this and say like let me

348
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,000
give you some percentage as the town or

349
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,480
let me help you to lay your concerns now

350
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,920
this going to cost some initial money

351
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,279
from the developer but it doesn't S save

352
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,240
it's G to save the money but it's gonna

353
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,279
save the money it's the cost of

354
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,000
contention it's the opposite of the

355
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,720
Pennywise pound foolish approach you're

356
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,839
going to be in court for five years that

357
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,800
five years rates are going to change

358
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,560
competition is going to move in in the

359
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,480
next town over all kinds of

360
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,160
uncontrollables that you're investors

361
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,199
are going to say uh-uh we're out because

362
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:17,279
you this happened while we were waiting

363
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,800
around dealing with the disastrous

364
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:23,639
reaction and what has happened in the

365
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,519
last three years which is exactly the

366
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:29,480
opposite of what I'm saying is

367
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,160
California and New York

368
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,880
and Michigan have changed the sighting

369
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,399
law and

370
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:40,199
said no more local review of these

371
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,319
decisions it's going right to the state

372
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,000
we're

373
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:46,000
preempting any conversation at the local

374
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,800
level so they're putting into law this

375
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,800
sort of they have decision about the

376
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,880
right they're saying oh my God we're

377
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,639
being delayed people at local levels are

378
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,000
opposed let's exclude them from the

379
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,480
conversation cuz we all know the gains

380
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,040
the gainers outweigh the losses to the

381
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,000
losers and the projects really ought to

382
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,600
be going ahead like really California

383
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,799
saying we sick of these little towns

384
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,120
saying like no you can't have and New

385
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:13,000
York yeah yeah yeah New York York and

386
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,280
California and Michigan okay and now my

387
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,160
own State here in Massachusetts the

388
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,400
governor created a commission to

389
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:25,319
streamline the sighting process what she

390
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:28,160
meant was she heard from her Pals

391
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,400
governors of New York and California

392
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,280
that this is what you should do just

393
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,120
exclude local and what you have in

394
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,080
Michigan when they change their law like

395
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,280
California New York is the developer

396
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,039
should talk to local

397
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,400
interests and if it makes a sincere

398
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,400
effort and can't succeed in finding

399
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,559
anyone to talk to then it should make a

400
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,559
contribution of a couple thousand

401
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,159
dollars to that

402
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,760
town that's not very far that's that's

403
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,200
what they've taken out of everything

404
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,280
that's happened and writing this wasw

405
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,400
last year and I'm trying to say that we

406
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,840
know a lot about Community benefits

407
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,120
agreements and how they should be

408
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,120
structured and who should be part of

409
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,760
negotiating them and the one thing we

410
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,480
know most of all is that they are

411
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,799
informal agreements that are not binding

412
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,039
and enforcable on anybody if they are

413
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:25,200
made between Town's people land owners

414
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,039
and the developer because those towns

415
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,679
people do not have legal standing to

416
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,720
join in contract and so unless the

417
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,919
municipal government signs it and unless

418
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,080
the state is willing to see that it's

419
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,760
enforced you can have any conversation

420
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,000
you want with anybody you can promise

421
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,240
anything you want and then ignore it and

422
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,120
that has happened and that is why

423
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:50,080
Community benefits agreements which were

424
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:52,440
made previously have a bad name so this

425
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,559
is fascinating to me so you what is

426
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,799
going to happen in a situation like

427
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:00,360
California where there's some renewable

428
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,919
energy project they go to some small

429
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,120
farm town or ranching town or whatever

430
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:05,600
what they're just going to be like we

431
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,960
want it here and the state's going be

432
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,559
like yeah and the township we going to

433
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,440
be like Noe they're going to sue and

434
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,000
then what happens it's happening now

435
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,799
after the law was passed a year and a

436
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,720
half ago they're they're going to be in

437
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,880
court for at least a decade we have

438
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,440
tribes in the west who are suing because

439
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,480
the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the

440
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,720
Bureau of Land Management told the

441
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,320
developer here's some land uh we we hold

442
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,880
this land in

443
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:35,280
for the tribes and it would be great and

444
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,720
they didn't consult with the tribe

445
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,320
there's law that says you have to

446
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,840
consult with tribes if you're doing

447
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,200
anything on their land I mean there's US

448
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,840
law and federal law no matter they

449
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,960
didn't consult they proposed it and as

450
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,640
soon as it's proposed and the tribe sees

451
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:57,360
it they said that's sacred land you got

452
00:19:53,640 --> 00:20:00,080
6,000 Acres you pick the spot that's a

453
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,880
sacred burial area if only you had

454
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,159
talked to us the way you are legally

455
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,760
obligated to and they said well we

456
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,480
talked to somebody I know we did and we

457
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,679
can't change this now because the

458
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,200
financing is all in place da d d d da

459
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,840
and then you're in court and those

460
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,320
projects don't go forward there has to

461
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,080
be a conversation the worst case is

462
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,520
projects that go ahead and the the line

463
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,000
from the electricity producing facility

464
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,360
to the transmission system goes over the

465
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,400
tribal land and they still don't have

466
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,600
electricity for the tribal properties

467
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,559
man is that a problem throughout Africa

468
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,440
and other developing countries but if

469
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,720
you said from the beginning we make sure

470
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,720
you have electricity and you're not

471
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,280
going to have to pay for it because

472
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,799
we're using your community's resources

473
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:54,400
for at least 30 years to make this solar

474
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:57,360
facility Wind Facility whatever it is

475
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,240
but there no discussion of this sort and

476
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,200
so the tribes have litigated in many of

477
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,080
the western states saying if you had

478
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,000
talked to us we would have told you

479
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:11,559
we're not saying we don't want any

480
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,799
change and I want to come to this

481
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:17,159
nickname for this whole problem nimi

482
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:21,400
that people are talking about not in my

483
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:24,440
backyard not in my backyard and you know

484
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,200
nimbyism is about upper middle class

485
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,480
folks saying we don't want

486
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,279
change that's the not what I'm talking

487
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:36,720
about I'm talking about the inevitable

488
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:40,799
distribution of adverse effects on a

489
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,320
small number of people who in my mind in

490
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,400
terms of fairness ought to be held

491
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,080
harmless they not necessarily have to

492
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,480
make money out of it but they at least

493
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,320
should be held harmless in terms of the

494
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,679
environment the social impact the

495
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,880
longterm cost of electricity to them and

496
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:00,559
so on and the the RS are not based that

497
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,200
they're based on gains to the gainers

498
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,760
outweighing the losses the losers

499
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,919
minimum environmental standards reviewed

500
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:10,000
everything else it's too bad and what's

501
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,000
happening is the people for whom it's

502
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,360
too bad are winning the sympathy of the

503
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
people who are

504
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,360
nearby who are saying you know I'm not

505
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,320
against this facility at all but I'm be

506
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,880
damned if I will let my neighbors be

507
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,000
treated this way this is

508
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,320
undemocratic but the reason to be

509
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,159
optimistic is if you you look at the

510
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,600
cause of the

511
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:38,360
contentiousness it's painfully obvious

512
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:41,840
what needs to happen to eliminate that

513
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:44,120
contentiousness and that cost which is

514
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,679
somebody if it's the private developer

515
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,799
then so be it although I hope they are

516
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:52,760
regulated by the state or even better

517
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:55,679
the federal government and they have to

518
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:59,279
talk with the people who might be

519
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:03,440
adversely affected before they make

520
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:06,480
deciding technology development related

521
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,600
decisions and I know that threatens to

522
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,840
raise the price of the land that they

523
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,720
have to secure the rights

524
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,600
to that's far part of the cost I also

525
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,919
think they could turn what I'm saying

526
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,279
back the other way and say you know if

527
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:23,159
we look at prevailing prices in the area

528
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,360
you're telling me that you want me to

529
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,720
pay you that much that's twice what you

530
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,159
could get from any other source and the

531
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,200
person says yeah well I don't have

532
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,960
anybody else and you're sitting here and

533
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,039
you got a lot of money and then that

534
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,480
person could say you know you're going

535
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,720
to make it necessary for me to move to

536
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,080
the next County and your community is

537
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,960
going to lose the

538
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:49,960
following and I'm going to make it clear

539
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,799
that it was you who's lost all that

540
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,840
benefit to your community so if there

541
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,320
were really benefits that had to be

542
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,960
negotiated I think it could be used by

543
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,900
the developer as a counterweight to what

544
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:12,039
they worry about about revealing things

545
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:12,039
[Music]

546
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,799
early so this is you know we're we're

547
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,559
talking

548
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:21,640
about energy infrastructure and and you

549
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:23,640
know ultimately as you say they can move

550
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,799
to the next County if they can't strike

551
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,520
a deal with the county that they're

552
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,440
initially interested in stuff can be

553
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,320
recited there are other sunny places

554
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,320
other windy places what about mining

555
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,159
it's you know it's really really Central

556
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,880
to the energy transition we need a lot

557
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:41,279
more copper we need a lot more aluminum

558
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,720
and iron for steel mines can't be

559
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,520
recited so easily what what's happened

560
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,480
how does how do you deal with

561
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,919
that same

562
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,360
principle whoever's in charge of giving

563
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,799
the license away for the subsurface

564
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,720
mining which is usually in the capital

565
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,480
somewhere and then some private

566
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,679
developers show up with a bunch

567
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:08,440
of equipment and nobody's talked to the

568
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:11,279
locals and they take out their

569
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,520
guns and they say you can't just come

570
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,320
here and start digging get out of here

571
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,880
and we mean

572
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:21,600
it and then the developer in in their

573
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,200
comforable headquarters back in the

574
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,720
Capitol calls the person that gave them

575
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,840
the lease for a vast amount of money

576
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,080
that goes into the federal Kitty

577
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,440
and said you need to send the

578
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,200
Army and that's what's happened is it

579
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,720
really absolutely

580
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,120
where pick a country that's where that

581
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,000
you've had mining you had to have the

582
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,120
federal government impose its will on

583
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,279
the locals it's not the dev largely in

584
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,520
Africa that we're talking about no

585
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:56,320
America it it it because the right to

586
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,360
take anything below the surface you need

587
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,080
a license and a permit from the national

588
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,240
government the national government makes

589
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,279
the deal gets a whole bunch of money

590
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,039
right the developer thinks they can now

591
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:12,919
go start work right nobody talked to the

592
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:15,520
local community because it's not

593
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:17,840
required again because the gains to the

594
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,640
gainers in this case small number of

595
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,000
wealthy government officials gainers uh

596
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,360
outweigh the losses to these peasants

597
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,320
locally C can you give an example of

598
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,559
whether you've been involved or not of

599
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:35,200
this happening in some specific Place

600
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,039
most of the work that we do as

601
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,399
mediators uh is

602
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:43,880
confidential um we don't want the Press

603
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:46,360
uh the media around we want people to be

604
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,880
able to speak without worrying what

605
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:52,080
their compatriots are going to say about

606
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,600
them the agreement is informal and then

607
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,880
when that informal conversation is done

608
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,559
then it moves into a formal context

609
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:04,640
where the developer now makes another

610
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:08,880
proposal to the official Regulators so

611
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:12,080
Chile they don't have minerals they

612
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,440
don't have oil they don't have gas have

613
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,600
coal and it's a big long country and the

614
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,520
capitals at the top and a lot of the

615
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,919
stuff that they may want to build and

616
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:28,440
make and do is in the South and they

617
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:31,559
have to run huge country long

618
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,960
transmission lines and when the

619
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:38,600
government changed uh three governments

620
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:42,279
ago they said maybe we should be asking

621
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:45,399
in each region what's their idea of how

622
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:49,720
they can contribute to meeting energy

623
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:53,720
demand and need in the country and that

624
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:56,600
of course comes on the heels of many

625
00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:00,159
years of dictatorship where the market

626
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:03,200
made all these decisions now you had

627
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,159
several administrations trying to do

628
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,880
that they chose to produce renewable

629
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,760
energy in each region in a different

630
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,880
way and they chose to have the regional

631
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,279
councils that were set up with multiple

632
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,640
interests

633
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:23,640
involved deciding where when and

634
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:26,200
how and what percentage of the benefits

635
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,760
including the sale of the electricity

636
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:33,320
would go back to the people in that

637
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,559
region what's a country that approaches

638
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,799
this in a way that you think I really

639
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:40,480
like that approach this is my all the

640
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:44,600
countries I've heard about in thinking

641
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,200
about where you put a Wind Facility and

642
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,120
and how you do this the right way and

643
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,519
how you get byy in who does it well

644
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,279
almost every Scandinavian country okay

645
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:54,760
and tell me what they do so all right so

646
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,360
at Landa and Finland what do they do

647
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:00,399
they they draw the line between public

648
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:03,039
and private is in terms of aspects of

649
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:06,360
decisionmaking and they have more

650
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:09,559
overall planning long range planning

651
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,880
ensuring fairness at the national level

652
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:14,919
and then they

653
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:18,039
decentralize to local or subnational

654
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:21,519
units for us would be States or counties

655
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:24,480
responsibility for doing the stuff it's

656
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:29,840
not socialization in terms of taking

657
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:32,519
over the doing of the stuff it's

658
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,880
nationalization and more emphasis on

659
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,120
public and public private partnership

660
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,399
for

661
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,720
planning we we don't believe in planning

662
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,559
in the United States we don't have

663
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,159
planning I teach happen to teach in the

664
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:47,080
planning department but that's another

665
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,960
story and then when if you plan then you

666
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,840
can say sustainability is the outcome of

667
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,320
a lot of stuff happening separately we

668
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,600
have to look at how all those things

669
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,440
relate okay so you know we were talking

670
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,720
before about little towns where people

671
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,480
like what you want to put what here and

672
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,360
like that could affect the how if you

673
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,760
live in little town in Finland how do

674
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,200
you feel better with the same kind of

675
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,640
Wind Facility right nearby how they do

676
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,760
it there two parts to the answer to that

677
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,039
the first is what people expect to

678
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,320
happen in their lives is they expect to

679
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:22,480
be treated

680
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,799
fairly and they believe if you say

681
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,919
what's your attitude toward the

682
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:28,960
government right right now you would

683
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:30,360
have in the US majority of people say we

684
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,120
don't trust the government we don't

685
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,799
think the government operates fairly we

686
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:38,200
don't like it because we've polarized

687
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:40,840
that discussion and it's Lo lost trust

688
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,159
and faith in government that trust and

689
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:47,200
faith exists in those places so there's

690
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,480
starting with a comfort level about well

691
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,440
if something's going to happen it's

692
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,799
going to happen because the decision was

693
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,559
made in a transparent accountable way

694
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:01,559
designed to maximize the public interest

695
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:03,799
we believe that we know that I'm not

696
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:07,000
arguing there's no corruption I'm not

697
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:08,760
arguing they don't make some mistakes

698
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,399
because they lean in One Direction or

699
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,519
another at the moment because of

700
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,880
political benefits or gains but in

701
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,039
general the public starts with an

702
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,960
expectation that when government does

703
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:26,360
something it's done in a fair

704
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:29,679
accountable transparent way aimed at

705
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,960
maximizing the shared or common interest

706
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,159
of the public okay so part one

707
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:38,000
expectations then the processes that

708
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:40,840
they rely on are to create citizen

709
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,799
advisory councils for everything okay

710
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,480
and they don't pick it's not a blue

711
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,240
ribbon committee chosen by the mayor

712
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,840
it's ensuring that all the different

713
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,120
interests I work with indigenous groups

714
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,760
in Scandinavia they have lots of

715
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:58,320
concerns that they are not being treated

716
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,240
fairly right but they're in a discussion

717
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,519
they're in a dialogue they're at the

718
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,360
table they may not be happy with h the

719
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:08,760
balance of not of of what's happened and

720
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,919
they certainly have good arguments

721
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,000
historically but

722
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:16,880
contemporaneously there's a public

723
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
advisory process at the local level

724
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,880
which is taken seriously and the law in

725
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,240
the

726
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:28,360
EU the law about public engagement is

727
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:31,080
really clear we don't have any law about

728
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,320
public engagement in America so I think

729
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,919
you told me you're an optimist but I

730
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,000
feel like a lot of what we've talked

731
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,720
about worries me because you know you

732
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,279
can do we talk so much to scientists

733
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,919
sort of moving something out of the lab

734
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,840
and then we have to think about how do

735
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:50,000
you manufacture something and you know

736
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,639
it's scale but then there's obviously

737
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,440
this whole other piece of it which is

738
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:57,880
then you have to put it into practice

739
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:00,559
somewhere and somebody lives near there

740
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,159
wherever there is don't you worry that

741
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,159
at least in the US we just like we just

742
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:06,799
don't have a decent process for doing

743
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:08,960
this and and and you were mentioning

744
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,480
before like we're maybe way below

745
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,000
capacity on what we the energy we could

746
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,679
produce

747
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,120
because basically fights between the

748
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,080
people who live here and the and there

749
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:26,639
and the and the uh

750
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,200
developers when not if when the

751
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:32,679
University

752
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:35,919
redefines its role the way we have as

753
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:39,240
providing a neutral space and Joint fact

754
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:42,320
finding capabilities and teaming up with

755
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,519
non for-profit providers of facilitation

756
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,200
Services the question of who's going to

757
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:50,600
help make this happen in each locality

758
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,480
is solved you think universities are the

759
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,919
place like the neutral place that you

760
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,080
know we're not used to thinking about

761
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:01,039
the university in that role but over the

762
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:04,840
last 3 years I've been part of an effort

763
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:07,399
to create in universities cyber security

764
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,399
for critical Urban infrastructure

765
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:12,879
training programs and we just started

766
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:16,960
one in MIT we said we'll teach students

767
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:20,040
to facilitate cyber security Improvement

768
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,560
at the local level and we'll offer our

769
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,879
services free to any

770
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,520
municipality that doesn't know what to

771
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:31,320
do or doesn't know how to proceed and

772
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,280
we've been doing that for five years and

773
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,599
Google came along and said that's a

774
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:40,320
really good idea uh I see youve formed

775
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,240
an association of 12 universities that

776
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,839
are now doing the same thing in cyber

777
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,879
security offering not for-profits and

778
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:49,679
communities assistance in dealing with

779
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,679
their vulnerabilities to Cyber attack

780
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,639
which are growing dramatically and which

781
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,639
raise huge financial loss

782
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,240
possibilities and they said here's $20

783
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:04,119
million find another 20 places which

784
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,040
we've done so now there's an association

785
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:10,359
of all these this is in less than five

786
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:14,440
years there's the possibility for any

787
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:16,520
municipality to get free assistance from

788
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:20,079
a university that has technically

789
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:23,599
capable people but cyber security

790
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:26,359
adjustments are not primarily technical

791
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,079
problems they're primarily local

792
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:30,800
political decisions about who's going to

793
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,920
have control over what what's the change

794
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,440
in the chain of command when you're

795
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,119
attacked who's going to be in charge

796
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,040
what money are you going to spend to

797
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:43,280
staff security it's not it it's a whole

798
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,960
new line in the budget oh my God we

799
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,839
don't have any money to do that and it's

800
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,960
very controversial to make the obvious

801
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,880
improvements that are going to protect

802
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,720
and and we go to communities that have

803
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,880
been attacked and had to pay huge Ransom

804
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,880
because they were victim of Ransom and

805
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,520
they didn't do anything after they're

806
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,720
absolutely every bit as vulnerable as

807
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,640
they were the day they were attacked

808
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,800
because they still don't have the

809
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,680
resources they don't have the capacity

810
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,480
but the idea is higher education

811
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:14,079
University I view what I'm doing in

812
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,240
training these folks as the same thing

813
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,359
that a law school does when it creates a

814
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,560
legal clinic or a medical school does

815
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:25,079
when it creates a a medical clinic we're

816
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,400
creating cyber security clinics now

817
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:31,000
we're doing a renewable energy Clinic

818
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,079
we need to formalize and allow the

819
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,560
process because it isn't

820
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:39,640
normally in this hyper politicized

821
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,119
context where nobody trusts the

822
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,160
government or vast numbers of people

823
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,720
don't trust the government they don't

824
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:47,640
trust the university either vast

825
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,400
majority of people do no longer trust

826
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,000
the university and when I say we're

827
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,440
going to play a neutral role and provide

828
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,480
a neutral space and make our scientific

829
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,240
and technical stuff available equally to

830
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,880
all sides oh yeah right and we have to

831
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,960
prove it right it funny I mean rule

832
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:07,319
making improving process it's like the

833
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:10,520
least sexy part of government stuff um I

834
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:13,359
have an MIT question for you so you work

835
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:16,359
alongside all these technologists many

836
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,720
of whom are very interested in trying to

837
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:23,960
create clean renewable

838
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:26,760
energy do you think people are aware of

839
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:29,480
you know what that sort of Last Mile so

840
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,800
to speak looks like that like here they

841
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,520
are really hard at work at trying to

842
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,319
change the planet and they've come up

843
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,839
with something and it it's going to be

844
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:41,880
great do you think they know what

845
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,560
implementation is going to look like or

846
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,359
are they very disconnected from that I

847
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:49,280
think they have been disconnected I

848
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,880
think they are becoming more aware

849
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,960
because they're hearing from the

850
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,440
sponsors of their

851
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:59,280
work uh you got anybody over there that

852
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,119
can be part of your team on How to Build

853
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,240
a Better wind turbine who could figure

854
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,760
out how the hell we get permission to

855
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,839
build the facility once we have the

856
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,839
better turbines and we now have a new

857
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,400
climate initiative with a new president

858
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:20,920
um that I think is going to ensure that

859
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:24,000
work on a fair transition or a just

860
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:27,640
transition is what happens not just do

861
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,319
we have the latest model for forecasting

862
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,800
the adverse effects going to be if you

863
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:35,599
don't do what we

864
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:39,839
say I have confidence because I see in

865
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:42,040
the hiring of new staff even in science

866
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,760
and engineering when you look at the

867
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,200
BIOS which you know 15 new people just

868
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,440
hired in the engineering school you look

869
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:54,240
at those bios 2third of those people

870
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:57,720
have in fact as part of their background

871
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:01,599
done work where they could be part part

872
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:03,480
of a collaboration that's new we had

873
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,640
talked in the beginning about a really

874
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:09,200
interesting example in the

875
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:11,200
US of you know sort of factionalism and

876
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,920
whatever I mean I think a little bit

877
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,480
about the cape wind thing because it's

878
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:19,760
here it's in the Massachusetts area

879
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,720
but do you want to talk about an example

880
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,440
that might be really interesting about

881
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,599
you know looking at how uh there's this

882
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:31,160
sort of factionalism when some sort sort

883
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,079
of energy project comes to town I have

884
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:36,000
to be careful because all of my

885
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:40,079
interventions guarantee anonymity okay

886
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,880
uh but but imagine a place that's real

887
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:47,040
uh in Massachusetts okay uh on the shore

888
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:50,280
and it has a newly elected town

889
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,160
government and the town government is uh

890
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,119
really concerned about the future of

891
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,920
offshore

892
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:00,480
wind and what it means to this town

893
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,599
big cables have to come across their

894
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,240
land to get connected to the

895
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:10,119
transmission system will all the tourism

896
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:12,560
that they currently have be lost because

897
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:14,000
all the views out the hotels are going

898
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,680
to be

899
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,760
obstructed by floating turbines right so

900
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,400
this town is saying uh we don't want to

901
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,160
wait around and see what

902
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,480
happens we want to have some way of

903
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,920
being in conversation

904
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,960
with offshore wind developers we have no

905
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,040
power over offshore wind developers but

906
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,760
we want to be in conversation with them

907
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,880
we want to be in conversation with the

908
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,960
state that's ultimately going to give

909
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,040
permissions and the federal agencies

910
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,960
that are going to have to give

911
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,760
permissions and we want to be able to

912
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,560
draw together people from all across our

913
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,800
town and have them be involved it isn't

914
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,960
going to be one meeting it'll be an

915
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,560
extended task force and we want to be

916
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,640
able to do it in a way that's open to

917
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,599
the rest of the public so that it can

918
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,079
become excited about and become part of

919
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,920
this and that we this isn't an offensive

920
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:08,319
play this is a how can we be part of

921
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:12,359
this in the way that we accept yes as I

922
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:16,319
I I chose to take your question to model

923
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:18,400
something that I know is real and this

924
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,560
leadership is interested in neighboring

925
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,440
towns and how it could perhaps involve

926
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:27,040
them subsequently in a collaborative

927
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:30,440
discussion which might ultimately lead

928
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,160
to to representation of local interests

929
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:36,359
in offshore wind in coastal

930
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:39,640
Massachusetts so they've come to uh the

931
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:42,560
clinic and we are in the process of not

932
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:46,359
only negotiating with them about what we

933
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:49,480
can do to staff and help them do this

934
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:53,720
but we're trying to put them in touch

935
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:57,599
with people at the appropriate federal

936
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,680
agencies who also are concern concerned

937
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,839
about what the future of conversations

938
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,400
going to be with local governments on

939
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:07,920
offshore wind in New England and we

940
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:12,040
we're trying to say that the uh federal

941
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:15,599
agencies should fund this locality's

942
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,839
efforts to staff and do all this work it

943
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,200
shouldn't just depend on our being able

944
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:23,800
to volunteer students in one course

945
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,680
especially because I think based on what

946
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,760
they're proposing we might be able to

947
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,839
recruit

948
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:35,440
at this early stage a whole slew of

949
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:37,119
Municipal leaders if this first one and

950
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,720
what they're doing could be presented in

951
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,800
the right way and if resources for this

952
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,160
could be coming from the federal

953
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,240
government and once the federal

954
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,200
government expresses interest I promise

955
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:50,000
the state government is going to follow

956
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,680
and want to be part of it and offer some

957
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,839
funds probably federal funds that it has

958
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:58,440
uh to assist so even in the context

959
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:03,160
we've been talking about everybody's out

960
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:06,960
to protect themselves reduce their costs

961
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:11,720
you have the opportunity for leadership

962
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:15,280
to not be against or for anything but to

963
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:18,319
create a different kind of dialogue

964
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,160
aimed at consensus facilitated

965
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:23,960
appropriately supported through joint

966
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:26,599
fact finding and maybe even

967
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,280
intergovernmental from its beginning and

968
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:31,599
when it devel developer comes to this

969
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:33,760
town I assume they haven't yet they have

970
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,280
okay they have um so how's that going is

971
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,359
it better because the town had sort of

972
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:42,240
talked through here's what we are the

973
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,920
old leadership of the town is the old

974
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,760
leadership and the new leadership is the

975
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,240
new leadership because the old

976
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:52,720
leadership didn't talk to the developers

977
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,400
in a way that majority of the community

978
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,319
was happy about I'm just going to leave

979
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,559
it at that okay they're what whichever

980
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:02,599
stand they took that's why they're not

981
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:05,440
the leadership anymore it was explicitly

982
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:07,359
about this issue so so is the new

983
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,440
leadership and a more adversar has a

984
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,680
more adversarial stance of the new

985
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,680
leadership says we're going to tend to

986
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,920
the interests of the whole Community oh

987
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,440
okay and we are going to prepare

988
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,680
ourselves okay the new leadership is the

989
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,119
the prepping the people who are prepping

990
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:27,480
um the old leadership just took a stand

991
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:30,760
and is that going to result in a more in

992
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:34,720
I think it's going to make the developer

993
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:36,440
obl incredibly happy okay and they're

994
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,680
not being asked to fund this process

995
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:42,280
that's the last thing that we would want

996
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,559
but they can tend they can be part of it

997
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:49,040
okay but there's no discussion going to

998
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:50,800
happen of their project at this time

999
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,520
this is a great example to conclude with

1000
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:58,079
I think they are framing the the the

1001
00:44:54,520 --> 00:45:00,520
future of how they're going to have wind

1002
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,960
if they're going to have wind in terms

1003
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:04,559
of the benefits that it will bring to

1004
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,720
the community in a way that works for

1005
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:08,319
the developer and that seems to me the

1006
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,440
sort of recognition of costs and

1007
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:12,440
benefits and not winners and losers but

1008
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,079
everybody

1009
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:18,720
winning but I would also point out that

1010
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,040
because we're looking at the subject or

1011
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,440
hopefully we'll be looking at the

1012
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,440
subject in

1013
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,280
depth in its

1014
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,800
entirety there might be a possibility

1015
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:32,760
that wind would come to this in this

1016
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:35,240
mici ofate not just about what offshore

1017
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:39,440
wind means to

1018
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:43,880
them what wind power means because we do

1019
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:46,920
have examples I mean city of gastra mass

1020
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:49,839
95% of all public electricity costs are

1021
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,480
covered by one turbine that is built on

1022
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:54,280
Industrial land wow that that

1023
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,119
municipality built it's gigantic and it

1024
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,559
was very controversial but it was done

1025
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:01,960
in the way that I

1026
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:04,960
describing and they everyone in town is

1027
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,240
very aware that that affects their tax

1028
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,079
