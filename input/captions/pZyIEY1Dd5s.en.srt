1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,480
Okay. So, here are our two godfathers of

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,519
biology and medicines, our keynote

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,519
speakers that um make you know frame the

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,559
arc of biology and medicines um that

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,119
this this symposium is really about. And

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,320
now I'm going to close and we'll um

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,279
introduce um our first keynote speaker

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,600
George Church. The first thing that came

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,119
to my mind was visionary frontier in

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,119
V12.

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,600
Um the definition is act of exploring

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,920
and advancing into new territories

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,160
whether in thought technology or society

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,719
by being an creative insightful and

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,879
forward-looking approach that is you in

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,440
my opinion. The second thought that came

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:50,160
to my mind and I ran it by your cousin

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,239
is the Swiss army knife of biology.

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,600
you have done um you have been a

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,920
trailblazing leader in the very

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,760
interfunction field and we spoke about

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,480
this earlier. I was in your office 10

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,359
years ago um and you have not only

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,400
inspired me but an enormous amount of

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,880
your trainees in the entire field to try

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,439
out new things and develop creatively

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,280
technologies as we go.

28
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,119
You have um been ahead of us nearly at

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,040
every given turn, George. You

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,680
co-invented next generation sequencing,

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,200
making the human genome project possible

32
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,600
and laying the foundation for what we

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,360
now take for granted in genomics. You

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,960
founded the personal genome project,

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,640
daring to imagine a future where

36
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,880
individuals could share actually their

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,840
genomes to accelerate science. That's

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,600
not far. Um, you have pioneered

39
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,439
multiplex genome engineering, not just

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,600
editing one gene, but thousands in

41
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,520
parallel. Your lab was among the first

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,920
to drive forward crisper technology,

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,920
developing base editors and other tools

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,680
that now are making it into the clinic

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,960
and that transform how we think about

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,960
rewriting genomes. You have really never

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,680
shied away at least from my perspective

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,240
from auditious questions from encoding

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,000
digital data and DNA to the extinction

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,560
to new frontiers in human health and

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,920
longevity. I think you have over more

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,879
than 600 publications, 150 patents,

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,720
started up more than 50 biotechn biotech

54
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,760
companies, many of those in the B2F

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,200
space and whole generations of trainees

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,599
who now lead labs and um startups and

57
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,319
companies across the world. So this

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,680
impact is multiplexed far beyond any

59
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,840
single achievement. and you're part of

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
the Academy of Science, the N the

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,599
National Academy of Science, National

62
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,080
Academy of Engineering, and so many more

63
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,040
awards that will take an entire hour to

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,560
just introduce you. I am um incredibly

65
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,480
grateful that you have accepted our

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,519
invite to give a keynote today to open

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,040
our bar to function symposium. And I'm

68
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,840
just going to give the stage over to

69
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,840
you, George. Thank you.

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:03,200
Yes, it's uh my great pleasure to be

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,879
back. Uh again, uh I want to talk

72
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,280
uh just like our previous speaker, I

73
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,239
have gotten over a

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,200
unknown but not COVID and not uh flu A

75
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,519
and B. Uh and it makes me a little bit

76
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,040
disappointed that I don't know the name

77
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,000
of that virus because we definitely have

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,760
the technology to do it. And I similarly

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
will show my disappointment. We haven't

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,480
sequenced everybody on the planet uh

81
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,480
yet. But anyway, there's there's lots of

82
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,360
positive news in this talk as well.

83
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,480
Okay. So, I want to talk about machine

84
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,159
learning AI in in particular combined

85
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,200
with multiplex libraries. We call this

86
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,519
ML squared and that uh and you'll see

87
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,120
why it the combination is far more

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,400
powerful than anything separately. I

89
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,080
think this audience in particular would

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,319
know that. And I want to focus on new

91
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,400
therapies. We're going in some cases

92
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,799
straight to new therapies without full

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,959
understanding of what we're doing. I

94
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,680
will admit that in the same sense that

95
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,720
we started vaccination back in the 1700s

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,680
before we knew that much about immuno

97
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,200
immunology and viology.

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,799
Okay, this is where we are. And I will

99
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,080
uh furthermore state some of my genetic

100
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:20,479
problems uh uh dyslexia

101
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:24,000
uh um serpena um respiratory issues and

102
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,520
um and narcolepsy. And this is I'm in

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,199
good company here with Thomas Edison

104
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,320
here hanging out with the president of

105
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:34,080
the United States back then. And uh and

106
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,479
and but my point of the slide is not uh

107
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,520
is not that. It's it's that a lot of

108
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,320
times what we find are simple mandelian

109
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,360
traits are not are not reflected in the

110
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,800
population. There are um you know low

111
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,320
penetrance and complex modifiers and so

112
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,000
to a certain extent almost everything um

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,639
almost every trait disease or not is

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,280
complicated. Um and yeah see all these

115
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,000
genes were were looked at simultaneously

116
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,440
in this paper which I recommend.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,120
So, so there'll be three examples. One

118
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,240
will be sleep, one will be height and

119
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,560
one more. And then this is uh this is

120
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,479
one of the most wellstudied uh traits as

121
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,360
you all know because it's collected in a

122
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,600
lot of G-W was studies on other things.

123
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,800
And this is an intermediate point quite

124
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,600
a few years ago, you know, showing 9,500

125
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,919
snips. Um but the important thing here

126
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,960
is again that the the therapies don't

127
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:35,120
necessarily res uh correspond to fixing

128
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,120
the snip or fixing the gene that the

129
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,840
snip is in. It very often is something

130
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,000
quite different. And in fact there there

131
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,160
uh over half a dozen different uh

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,160
therapies that involve growth hormone

133
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,240
that have to do with this polygenic um I

134
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,080
won't call it disease. It's it's a

135
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,880
trait. uh but there are nevertheless

136
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,880
medical treatments for it.

137
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,080
They aren't related necessarily to the

138
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,320
the alals that cause them. And the final

139
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,639
one is aging. Age related diseases are

140
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,319
going to kill 90% of us probably. And uh

141
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,080
and there and it's and it's very

142
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,520
complicated. Um but I think it's well

143
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,360
within our range and and with

144
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,240
exponential technologies that we'll be

145
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,039
discussing in a second. Um it looks like

146
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,440
it's happening faster and faster. Here's

147
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,639
a nice study from my not from my lab but

148
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,759
from my colleague Vadim Kadesv who I

149
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,759
collaborate and on centinarians and the

150
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,919
story wasn't that there's one key

151
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,680
regulator gene that that we just had to

152
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,479
figure out for aging. It's more that

153
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,240
there's a depletion of uh you know

154
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,759
serious loss of function germline

155
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,280
mutations that may not be um super so

156
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,600
serious depending on how many doses you

157
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,160
have but contribute to age related

158
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,160
disease

159
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,560
and then so this this is all building up

160
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,800
to these three examples of function

161
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,479
building up to an argument I'm making

162
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,759
that that um that whole whole genome

163
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,680
sequencing is something that can be

164
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,440
applied at various times during one's

165
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,599
life and And the goal there is

166
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,720
prevention, not necessarily figuring out

167
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,840
mechanism and so forth. Um, and Orchid

168
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,680
Health, for example, is um, one of one

169
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,919
of my companies that does whole genome

170
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,919
sequencing on every single in vitro

171
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,680
fertilization embryo that goes through

172
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:24,080
the clinic. So, that's a it's a new tool

173
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,880
that can um

174
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,360
can prevent uh problems with pregnancy

175
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,560
and problems with newborns.

176
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,319
Um Molina just mentioned the personal

177
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,960
genome project. This is something that

178
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,479
that we've been advocating since 2005.

179
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,280
This um um

180
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,960
uh it's it's it's still an unusual

181
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,039
project. I don't know whether it's still

182
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,960
unique but but the idea was to do both

183
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,400
genome sequencing with full medical

184
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,280
records and multiomics

185
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,919
not deidentified specifically consented

186
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,639
for fully open integrated and even

187
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,240
commercial use. A lot of a lot of the

188
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,240
resources we have in the genomics

189
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,440
community do not uh do not allow

190
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,759
commercial use as a default state and

191
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,039
and as a consequence of that consenting

192
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,639
mechanism we were approved by the um

193
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,680
NIST and FDA for genome bottle. Um two

194
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:25,360
of our two of our trios are now fully

195
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,000
sequenced um just recently um thanks to

196
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,720
the TDT consortium and so forth. They

197
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,880
have a cube 100. That's a fairly rare

198
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,039
quality level of 1 in 10 billion. Um,

199
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,440
and it's just because they happen to be

200
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,159
hanging out in this open project that

201
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,080
they were selected. Uh, one Ashkanazi

202
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,279
trio and one Hanchinese trio. Um,

203
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,120
critical assessment of genome

204
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,320
interpretation, genome project, right,

205
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,519
which is still just taking off recently.

206
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,760
Um, the encode project horses various

207
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,320
sorts. uh three and four um structure of

208
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,720
nuclei and various stem cell banks and

209
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,760
and even some companies again because we

210
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,320
didn't forbid commercial use by in the

211
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,240
consenting mechanism.

212
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,399
Anyway, well every everything I'll

213
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,519
mention about uh uh transition

214
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,920
translation into commercial use starts

215
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:26,880
with this personal genome project as the

216
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:29,200
source of the biomedical materials. Um

217
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,920
so we'll talk about just quickly about

218
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,240
where all of you know where we are on

219
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,000
analytic and synthetic. Synthetic is

220
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,920
mostly what I do but we did uh so this

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,120
has been improving faster than Moore's

222
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,120
law for you know since the the u

223
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,440
since uh the 80s or before and it went

224
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,839
it jumped up a little bit. I would say

225
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,040
this mostly due to multiplexing

226
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,720
uh and uh and even synthesis it

227
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,720
continues. We're making libraries in the

228
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,240
order of 10 to the 17th yet. They're not

229
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,279
fully utilized yet, but they're they're

230
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,360
um and and we we introduced this the um

231
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,760
these multiplex chip synthesis in 2004,

232
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,120
and it really wasn't picked up on by

233
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,680
groups outside of our collaborators here

234
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,000
at the Broad and and uh at Harvard

235
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,519
Medical School in general

236
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,040
for about a decade. Um then nanopore

237
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,440
sequencing you all know this and uh

238
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,360
fluorescent microscopy sequencing which

239
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,160
is sometimes called fluorescent nextgen

240
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,720
sequencing and it ble bled over as a

241
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:43,200
single fiberblast cell that which each

242
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:47,600
of the the the GATC forc color is is

243
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,600
recited as a as a barcode um indicating

244
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,040
the RNA type but we've you know we

245
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,600
worked with uh complete genomics now MGI

246
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,880
um with aluminina with 10x genomics

247
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:03,600
which is now spatial omix um which gives

248
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:07,120
us 3D um DNA RNA protein at resolutions

249
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,959
up to 20 nmters and actually we just

250
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,600
published one at 2 nanometer resolution

251
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:16,959
with turf microscopy

252
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,640
okay so gene therapies in Asia um

253
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,600
I'm interested in affordable

254
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,079
technologies both now the reading

255
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,000
genomes is 20 million times cheaper and

256
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:30,240
considerably higher quality. Um but uh

257
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,079
what about therapies and especially gene

258
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,320
therapies? When I entered gene therapy

259
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,959
field many years ago, I was concerned

260
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,160
that I might not be able to do or we may

261
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,800
not be able to do for gene therapies

262
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,320
what we did for gene sequencing because

263
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,480
it was it has gone up by 10 eightfold in

264
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,320
eight years. Um that's opposite

265
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,640
direction. So, it's now $4 million a

266
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,560
dose. And it and it's not just gene

267
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,680
therapies. It's it's orphan drugs in

268
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,440
general. It's great that we have the

269
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,920
orphan drug act that allows us to

270
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,880
finally target these rare diseases, but

271
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,279
it has this problem which I have argued

272
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,720
for years and and I think recently was

273
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,959
validated is they have um it's related

274
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,279
to market size. So most most of these

275
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,880
diseases have hundreds of people that

276
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,560
benefit

277
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,639
and the research and development and

278
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,040
clinical trial costs are fairly fixed

279
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,200
and the denominator is just too low to

280
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,959
get a a a good price. But if you get in

281
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,519
if you get to the denominators in the

282
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:33,279
billions of people as was the case for

283
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:36,480
for co 19 uh 6.5 billion people um

284
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,079
took it uh the these form these were

285
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,720
formulated as gene therapies either as

286
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,760
viral or or lipid nanoparticle messenger

287
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,200
RNA but then the price came down to $30

288
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,880
a dose and I think that's going to be

289
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,800
true for everything that that fix those

290
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,240
it's either a common disease or can be

291
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,000
formulated

292
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,680
approached as a common disease and the

293
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,079
other big one which I've already

294
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,120
mentioned age related diseases so I'm

295
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,920
going to focus in on that a bit um we

296
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,240
know quite a bit so it's sort of have to

297
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,720
be full there's a lot of ignorance about

298
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,279
about the biochemistry of of age related

299
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,600
diseases there a lot known and the key

300
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:18,639
of synthetic biology and and engineering

301
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:21,440
in general is um to get started on it

302
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,440
while we're still half ignorant Um and

303
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,160
so this is just a simple cartoon with

304
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,320
the extracellular matrix on at the top,

305
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,279
the lipid billayer and the cytoplasm and

306
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,240
it's all signaling and organels

307
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,399
especially the organal nucleus and and

308
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,399
some of our favorite actors in here like

309
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:43,839
OSK which are the Yamanaka factors and

310
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:47,120
um and then we picked uh out of we did

311
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,880
48 gene therapies and by we I mean uh

312
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,360
Noah Davidson who I'll mention again in

313
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,079
a moment um 48 gene therapy

314
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,320
simultaneously as a postto. I was amazed

315
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,440
at how quickly that went. And then we

316
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,440
check picked a set of three subsets

317
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,720
fibroblast growth factor 21 uh TGF beta

318
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,440
2 receptor um

319
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,160
soluble form so not the natural form and

320
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,880
then alpha cloth or ATF we'll call that

321
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,360
for short and OSK for these three in

322
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,600
nucleus. So these these were picked to

323
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,880
be secreted. We knew that you could

324
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,199
transfer some youthfulness via blood

325
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,839
from young animals to to old animals.

326
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,920
Uh, and we just took a guess that these

327
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,079
three since they were secreted and they

328
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,320
pass this gene therapy test that I'll

329
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,000
show you just a moment. And we wanted

330
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,240
them to be expressed in livers, which is

331
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,880
one of the easier things to do. And we

332
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:46,160
want them to be tested not with

333
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:50,560
biomarkers or gene aging clocks but with

334
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:54,560
um with age related disease models. So

335
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,120
uh one is uh the uh

336
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,560
high high caloric western diet uh for

337
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,720
these mice where they get about double

338
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,560
their size. And then these are these are

339
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,880
the various combinations of these three

340
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,160
genes. We're delivering them separately

341
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,680
in independent AAV vectors and and you

342
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,560
can see it's focused especially on the

343
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,480
red and the pink uh which which are

344
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:20,639
doing well in both the obesity and um

345
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,760
diabetes models and also in the um in

346
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,839
this kidney uh obstruction model where

347
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:30,480
it starts out with a normal kidney and

348
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:34,480
and then recovers. Um so

349
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,959
we took this um Noah here uh took this

350
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,600
into uh

351
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,279
uh pre-clinical and toward uh clinical

352
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,360
trials now from both human and dogs uh

353
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,160
for example mitro valal disease. You can

354
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,480
see the various uh indications we're

355
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,839
following here have relatively little to

356
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,560
do with each other other than that they

357
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,360
have they're all age related diseases

358
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,279
and uh we use both the ATF triple

359
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,880
combinations is triple gene therapy and

360
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,759
OSK

361
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,440
um OSK is supposed to is thought to work

362
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,360
in the nucleus and the ATF are thought

363
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,399
to work through secretion but um

364
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,920
uh I think they may both work by

365
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:19,519
rejuvenate uh rejuvenating the liver.

366
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,160
So, um,

367
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,040
we don't typically go to the FDA with

368
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,680
the I mean these are we're in

369
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,600
discussions with the FDA, but as age

370
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,880
related diseases, a specific age related

371
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,639
disease as I showed in the previous

372
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,959
slides, not longevity, not aging

373
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,040
reversal, any of that. Uh, because they

374
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,600
don't consider that a disease and even

375
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,880
if they did, it's it's much longer

376
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,240
clinical trials than we want to do. So

377
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,440
um but nevertheless we do on occasion

378
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,279
take uh the pre-clinical trials and let

379
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,279
them go on and turn it into a lifespan

380
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,199
trial. Again this is not for the FDA.

381
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,800
This is just for publication purposes.

382
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,800
And this was published in cellular

383
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,720
reprogramming. And here we have this

384
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,160
triple gene therapy. And I should

385
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,079
mention I think since aging is

386
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,480
complicated enough there may be some

387
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,120
magic bullet single gene single small

388
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,039
molecule or even but we think it's a

389
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,760
case for polyarm pharmacy where we get

390
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,760
have to get all of the whack-a-ole done

391
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,319
at once or nearly at once. So anyway,

392
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,439
this is a triple therapy uh of the

393
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:28,640
Yamanaka uh reprogramming factors and we

394
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,880
we applied the dose very late in life of

395
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,320
these animals at the point where half of

396
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,640
them were dying um under good laboratory

397
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,440
conditions are dying of old age and we

398
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,919
nevertheless get this um big improvement

399
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,200
where blue is the experimental and black

400
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,360
is the control uh animals. So about 50%

401
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,720
extension of life from this midpoint of

402
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,520
death. So

403
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,960
um so let's let's talk about the role of

404
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,440
machine learning and all in all the

405
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,200
things I've been talking about in I'm

406
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,280
going to frame it in terms of uh

407
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,360
delivery but it it applies to almost

408
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,600
everything else we do as well and have

409
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,880
been doing for years. Here we're looking

410
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,440
at tissue tropisms, immune reaction, um

411
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,280
pharmacocinetics, phicodnamics

412
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,120
doing it rodent and in primate models

413
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,360
you see in the next slide. And these are

414
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,799
some of the um new um vectors uh aav

415
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,200
vectors that we've developed with their

416
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,320
code names here. And they they are

417
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,799
either for brain or specific for neurons

418
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,720
um muscle and so on. And here is where

419
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,720
we look through every possible

420
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,799
combination of um every possible amino

421
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,240
acid substitution at every position

422
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:43,039
along the capsid. Um

423
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,840
and uh

424
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,559
this the capsid here is about 738 amino

425
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,039
acids and then so and then we went to

426
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,760
higher levels in not just single amino

427
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,240
acid changes but but multiple up to 28

428
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,080
at a time. Now obviously you know that

429
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,640
the common notori blows up when you're

430
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,400
about three or four at a time especially

431
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,320
if you're letting them be anywhere in

432
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,039
the 738

433
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,240
aminoes but I'll show you how that I'm

434
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,919
sorry in that one uh I I think you all

435
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,840
intuitively know that red means that

436
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,559
it's much stronger than wild type and

437
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,919
blue might mean much weaker and uh and

438
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,480
and it's and the winners of the mutants

439
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,640
that win are are in different places for

440
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,120
the different tissues. So, I'll show you

441
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,280
specific example here. We're comparing

442
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,880
it to what was the very best in the

443
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,320
field at the time. It was everybody's

444
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:38,080
go-to for for brain and neural delivery.

445
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,160
Um, and we um we use this combination of

446
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,080
machine learning and multiplex libraries

447
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,919
to inject. We went straight to primates.

448
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,600
We did not do in vitro or yeast display

449
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,840
or mouse or anything. We went straight

450
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,559
to two different primate species and

451
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,320
injected a million different designs. So

452
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,400
these are all designed by machine

453
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,720
learning. They were not randomized by

454
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,320
PCR or anything any other random thing.

455
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,960
Every single one of the million was

456
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,720
designed which me and you'll see in the

457
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,160
next slide exactly what the consequence

458
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,160
is uh or but here the consequence we're

459
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,480
focusing on is 100 times better than the

460
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,799
previous best at targeting the brain.

461
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,720
You can see these are

462
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:21,280
uh allegedly at the same um intensity

463
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:25,039
um before the the the previous winner

464
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:28,000
and this new one called BCAP 1 or HD9

465
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,360
and uh we deargeted the liver 10fold.

466
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,640
Now deargeting the liver is quite

467
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,360
important. You want to keep the dosage

468
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,000
as low as possible. And if if a lot of

469
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,559
the material is going to be sequestered

470
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,640
in the liver, you both lose it from

471
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,240
where you want to target, but it's also

472
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,039
um

473
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:49,520
um a chance of having toxicity in the

474
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:52,080
liver. So that deargeting was important.

475
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,000
And so the way that we got these these

476
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,919
large libraries and the reason we use

477
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,760
machine learning to design them is that

478
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,880
when we don't use machine learning or

479
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,520
use poor models, we get a difficulty

480
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,480
where this is the the percent changes in

481
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,360
the in the uh we looked at a domain of

482
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,240
28 amino acids in this early experiment.

483
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,919
Um asking how how heavily we can bombard

484
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,440
it. The last slide I showed we could

485
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,400
change one at a time all over 738 amino

486
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,720
acids. Here we picked the surface of

487
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,960
domain of 28 amino acids and we had

488
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,280
trouble getting three or four amino

489
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,720
acids at a time without breaking it. So

490
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,720
it didn't work as a virus asset at all.

491
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,320
If we use logistic regression, some

492
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,120
other neural network methods, we could

493
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:42,000
get out to 26 27 28 all 28 at once and

494
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,840
not just an example but a whole library

495
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,440
that were that radically changed. We

496
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,200
hope that that sort of radical change

497
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,039
without breaking the virus would allow

498
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,799
us to get the new tissues and that's how

499
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,720
we got the new tissues. And I just want

500
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,320
to mention this is not limited to cap

501
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,320
viral capsules. It's limit it's it can

502
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,600
apply to all sorts of other categories

503
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,240
of of therapeutics and delivery methods.

504
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,640
So for example, proteins are a main one.

505
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,360
Um and here we didn't want to have a big

506
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,280
bulky capsid or nucleic acid hanging off

507
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,039
of it as a barcode. We had in the

508
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,880
previous one we had the benefit in the

509
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,600
previous one that that's natural for

510
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,320
AAV. Here we wanted a short peptide

511
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,080
which we call M codes and we could and

512
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,559
we made thousands of these. Now this

513
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:31,280
just shows 96 of them and shows how

514
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:35,039
clean we we co- co-developed co- machine

515
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:40,000
learning uh and and large library made

516
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:42,559
pairs of binders and uh barcodes. And

517
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,360
you can see there's almost no off

518
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:50,559
diagonal binding um in this um in this

519
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,640
combination of binders and barcodes. Um

520
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,919
here's a blowup showing this really dark

521
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,640
along the diagonal and and target. And

522
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,640
this is we've used this in a nonprofit

523
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,640
E11 bio which is doing a conneto uh at

524
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,640
about 100 times higher efficiency than

525
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,840
ever before. And that will allow us to

526
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,120
do mouse and human brain connectivity.

527
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,760
But mainly we're using it for these

528
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,679
tissue specific medicines where proteins

529
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,440
have the same story that I told you in

530
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,520
the last slide about um viral capsules.

531
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,799
And here's an example of you know the

532
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,720
protein equivalent what I was talking

533
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,960
about before for the brain um both

534
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,440
studies protein and caps were brain.

535
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,080
Here we're using a humanized mouse with

536
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,480
a human transferin receptor in the

537
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,520
brain. And we get a 10-fold enrichment

538
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,120
of the winner relative for the average

539
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,120
um

540
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,880
um protein uh in this set. And and in

541
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,720
each case, we use multiple barcodes for

542
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,280
the same protein. Make sure it's not

543
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,960
some barcode artifact. And what we find

544
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,799
in vitro is very different from what we

545
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,600
find in vivo. So we tend to do it in

546
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:01,280
vivo as close to human as possible.

547
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,280
either human eyes, mouse or primate.

548
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,960
And so this ML squared I think is

549
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:07,440
general. It's it's been the foundation

550
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,120
of almost all our recent startups from

551
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,360
my my lab. I've already mentioned Dino

552
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,279
Therapeutics with Eric and Manifold

553
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,960
thanks to Pierce and Gleb. Um Jura has

554
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,360
written this preprint which I encourage

555
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,880
you to read. It's it's we haven't done

556
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,799
much with it in terms of screening but

557
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,679
we have um synthesized in the 17th

558
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,279
designs without randomization

559
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,159
uh without

560
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,320
much randomization. Helix Nano Laya.ai

561
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,760
AI is a local company that's focused not

562
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,000
just on uh biotech but in science in

563
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,799
general and it's and one by one we're

564
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,400
going through fields where we'll pick at

565
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,440
you know an achievement of one of our

566
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,960
colleague companies and fields that we

567
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,279
know relatively little about and try to

568
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,520
exceed them you know so for example

569
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,960
good-hearted competition with Madna

570
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,720
which is a sibling company

571
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,559
um and then finally and I really want to

572
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,120
open this up for questions

573
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,960
uh setting aside enough time for that.

574
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,120
Um

575
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,640
uh we just want to end on these cell and

576
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,799
organ therapies. Um so

577
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,960
um you all know that there's a human

578
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,960
cell atlas and and a fantastic uh

579
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,880
resources on transcription for a variety

580
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,120
of different tissues, single cell

581
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,520
sequencing and so forth. We wanted to

582
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,559
figure out uh the regulatory. So

583
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,880
variance the function a lot of the

584
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,039
variants are regulatory either cis or

585
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,520
trans. And we'd like to figure out the

586
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,640
code that have that affects such

587
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,039
profound things of developmental uh and

588
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,240
tissue specific nature expression and so

589
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:49,279
forth. And and here is

590
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,799
we we made a a nearly comprehensive

591
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:55,360
transcription factor library. Um and we

592
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:58,080
we made in the first paper which is in

593
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,880
nature biotech thanks to Alex and Paris

594
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,640
300 different recipes and and some and

595
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,440
we characterize them by trans

596
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,320
transcription heat maps like this one

597
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,400
and we weren't

598
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,880
we would get some that looked synonymous

599
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,720
and and uh even though and these were

600
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,360
all single transcription factors. Most

601
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,440
of what we've done since then has been

602
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,960
two or more multiple transcription

603
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,440
factors required to get the tissue of of

604
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,440
interest. But we would get 10 different

605
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,200
solutions for endothelial cells. So this

606
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,679
is a broad category. We all know that

607
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,279
there's different very big differences

608
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,960
between endothelial cells in the brain

609
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,120
and the livers for example. But lumping

610
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,799
them together is 10 different recipes.

611
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,559
10 different recipes for neurons. Again,

612
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,520
there's great diversity with within that

613
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:47,279
category and in different recipes for

614
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,320
fiberglass. And we got we found to our

615
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,279
surprise and delight that about we came

616
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,000
to get used to that these recipes would

617
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,400
be 98% conversion in 4 days. Even though

618
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,440
when we started on this the standard was

619
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,000
to try to emulate what happens during

620
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,240
natural development where where it takes

621
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,919
hundreds of days to get through all the

622
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,640
developmental phases going through all

623
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,960
the different progenitors and it seemed

624
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,880
like that should be the goal and we

625
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,440
being synthetic

626
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,559
um were willing to take whatever we

627
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,039
could get. I think there are certain

628
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,120
advantages to doing it quickly and at

629
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,360
high efficiency.

630
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,760
Uh anyway, this this nature biotech

631
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,600
turned into this company GC Therapeutics

632
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,919
which has a couple of things moving into

633
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,600
clinical trials including

634
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,640
um

635
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,679
uh liodenderite precursor cells. These

636
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,080
these uh liytes are responsible for the

637
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,480
white matter which constitutes about uh

638
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,039
40% of your brain where where things

639
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,480
have to go fast and it wraps a certain

640
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,640
number of times around an axon with

641
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,279
myelin and demyelinating diseases

642
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,520
typically autoimmune diseases uh create

643
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,880
havoc with this and if you bring in

644
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,799
freshender sites they're going to

645
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,640
suffer the same fate although we

646
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,720
engineered these iligodender sites to

647
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,559
not only restore the myelin but also be

648
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:14,399
resistant at the cytoine uh uh

649
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,120
strategies uh for um autoimmunity in the

650
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:20,799
future. So this is one of the things

651
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,039
that we're doing. This second example

652
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,799
not from GZ therapeutics but from two

653
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,799
graduate students recent graduate

654
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,480
students from my lab who are interested

655
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:35,919
in developing ovarian follicles from uh

656
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:38,880
human stem cells and this is because uh

657
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,440
uh these going to be par uh dozens of

658
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:45,279
painful hormones as part of the IVF

659
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:48,799
process. We reduced the number and uh of

660
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:52,960
the of these injections reducing the the

661
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:56,159
cost by three-fold in the pain. The

662
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,360
oytes were immature. The eggs needed

663
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,760
maturation. We developed an IPS derived

664
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,760
granulosis cells. These are very much

665
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,559
like the support structure that happens

666
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:10,799
in ovarian follicles in vivo. And um

667
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,960
fast forward to the present, we're in

668
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,600
phase three clinical trials. As far as

669
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:19,760
we know, it's the first IPS-based

670
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,919
therapy um with FDA approval to to enter

671
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,000
phase three clinical trials. Somehow we

672
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,799
it's a very crowded field IPS based

673
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,279
therapies. We jump to the front in in

674
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:33,679
part because this is just maturing eggs.

675
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:36,080
It's not doing more than that.

676
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,600
Now that's that's how we can get tissues

677
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,480
fairly sophisticated tissues like

678
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,360
ovarian follicles. Um but when we want

679
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,840
really complicated organs and we're

680
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,960
focusing initially on kidney, liver and

681
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,559
heart um

682
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,120
we need something we need something

683
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,159
better than human so far. This may

684
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,039
change than human stem cell derived. And

685
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:01,200
for that we we go to a developmental

686
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,320
system that's very close to human in

687
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,679
size physiology and and then this has

688
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,960
been known for years. We didn't invent

689
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,840
this. In fact we were invited when when

690
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,600
uh three of the pioneers of the

691
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,919
xenotransplantation field read our

692
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,880
crisper paper. invited us to work on

693
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,720
this and and Luhan Yang who was a

694
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,279
graduate student posttock and co-founder

695
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,840
of eugenesis with me uh took this on as

696
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:29,279
a challenge and and we were very we're

697
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,880
all very grateful that she did. Um

698
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,360
there's hundreds of thousands of people

699
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,120
on dialysis that would love to be off

700
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,799
dialysis

701
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,720
even if it means having part of their

702
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,240
body be from a pig. Um and and one of

703
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,279
the things that the FDA was most

704
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,840
concerned about was that these patients,

705
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:52,320
all transplant patients except identical

706
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:56,240
twins uh are have uh immune suppressants

707
00:30:52,320 --> 00:31:00,080
as part of the protocol. And uh every

708
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,120
pig organ produces lots of retrovirus

709
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:06,320
more than more than most mammals. And

710
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,240
each of these is we've we and others

711
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,919
have shown that will infect uh human

712
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,919
cells and then replicate in the human

713
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:16,559
cells and infect other cells. An immune

714
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:19,520
suppressed patient is a setup for uh

715
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:23,760
evolution uh of a zonotic virus and I

716
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:26,000
think we are all sick of zonotic viruses

717
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,399
uh and don't want to create a new one.

718
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,399
Um, so anyway, so we knocked them out

719
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:34,080
and it turned out it was very easy to do

720
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:35,919
with plain vanilla crisper. Um, we did

721
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,279
that many years ago and we've done it

722
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,640
many times since then in multiple

723
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:43,039
different pig strains. Um, we did three

724
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,840
knockouts. These were incredibly fast

725
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,080
acting rejections. These were not your

726
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:52,399
ordinary humanto human rejection. These

727
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:55,360
were u sugars. Um, and then we put in

728
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,679
seven trans gene. humanize the blood

729
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,480
compliment, the blood clotting, the

730
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,960
innate immunity and inflammation, the

731
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,960
seven human trans genes.

732
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,960
Um,

733
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,960
and we uh I'll show you the patient in

734
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,039
just a moment, but I wanted to say that

735
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,720
we're not just responding to the

736
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,480
incredible shortage of organs. We are uh

737
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,159
looking forward to enhancements of

738
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,200
various sorts uh including uh you know

739
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,360
DNA damage u immunity pathogens cancer

740
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,559
scessence all of which have precedence

741
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,480
in both natural variation and in

742
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,960
synthetic biology and I'm just going to

743
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,039
show you this uh the one which we both

744
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,600
worry about and are encouraged by it's

745
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,880
very interesting and it's has to do with

746
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,799
variance and function um is these are

747
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,480
human specific pathogens there's a large

748
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,080
number of parasites, bacteria and

749
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,360
viruses.

750
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,519
Um but then there are also some subset

751
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,159
which are present shared with humans and

752
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,880
pigs and uh we need to worry about these

753
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,840
and the ones previous slide uh depending

754
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,640
on whether it's a whole organism thing

755
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,760
uh or a cellular level um we may not

756
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:13,200
have to worry about all of these.

757
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:15,600
And this is uh uh a video hopefully of

758
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,600
uh Tim Andrews who's now been eight

759
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,000
months off of diialysis with this uh pig

760
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,279
kidney from from uh that I've been

761
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,320
describing. Um thanks to these surgeons.

762
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,760
Let's see if Oh, there we go. Um so

763
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,640
that's the the pig kidney being

764
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,960
transferred over. Uh he's been 8 months.

765
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,720
We have another patient who has uh was

766
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:42,320
treated in in June. This is him very uh

767
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,080
excited about um about being off

768
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,799
dialysis

769
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,240
and I just want to open up for just

770
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,760
broad discussion plenty of time uh but I

771
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,760
want to thank all the members of the

772
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,519
personal genome project. These are we

773
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,000
have we had for a while annual meetings

774
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,320
of the not just of the scientists and

775
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,080
the engineers and the physicians but the

776
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,240
patients as well which is something that

777
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,079
was afforded by the fact that we are not

778
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,839
the identified

779
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,159
um and then I also want to thank my this

780
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:16,560
is my alumni this is not my actual lab

781
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:20,240
size this is alumni meeting okay so uh

782
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,240
open up for questions

783
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:34,399
What an impressive talk covering so many

784
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,159
aspects relevant to VF George. It's

785
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,159
phenomenal. Are there questions in the

786
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,159
audience?

787
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:48,079
Don't be shy. Engage.

788
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:51,359
I can start. Um so you're spending this

789
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:55,200
arc from the personal genome

790
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,520
project over longevity which clearly is

791
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,440
the most common disease of all if you

792
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:05,359
want so to rare disease indications that

793
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,920
are genetically anchored. Um each of

794
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:11,119
these pillars with enormous track

795
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:15,200
records of advancing it to the clinic.

796
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:18,320
How do they interface? How do you draw

797
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:22,000
conclusions from personal genome data

798
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:25,680
for predicting longevity targets and

799
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,400
identifying those that will be likely

800
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,760
having an impact in patients?

801
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,440
>> Yeah. So,

802
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,680
so even though I've been a strong

803
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,200
advocate for personalized medicine since

804
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,839
before it was called that, um

805
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,000
I also feel that there's a lot of common

806
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:48,000
diseases that are better treated as if

807
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,400
they were diseases of our species rather

808
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,560
than of individuals and aid and I think

809
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,680
a lot of age- related diseases will fall

810
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,320
into that category like you can

811
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,720
you can redefine a lot of common

812
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,040
diseases as age- related diseases. Not

813
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,599
all of them, but but many of them. And

814
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,200
so it uh and I also feel that that baked

815
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,079
into the personal genome project before

816
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,520
it even started was the idea that a lot

817
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:19,040
of these diseases were avoidable um but

818
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:23,680
preventable by uh genetic counseling.

819
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:26,240
And even though I have

820
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,839
advocated uh gene therapies for rare

821
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,440
diseases, I've also pointed out

822
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,800
continuously that there is a more

823
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,680
cost-effective way to do it long term as

824
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:39,520
we go forward. Um

825
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:42,720
which is to get the entire population

826
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:46,240
sequenced. Um it is now definitely cost

827
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:49,680
effective to do that. Um I I estimate

828
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,599
there's a 10-fold return on investment

829
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,079
uh

830
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:59,119
uh if we did that uh mainly due to uh

831
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:02,480
carrier uh screening of very serious

832
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,200
mandelian diseases may affect 3 to 5% of

833
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,760
the population but that 3 to 5% cost

834
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,359
millions of dollars per patient not to

835
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,880
mention loss of of um anxiety for the

836
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,480
whole family and community. So, um, why

837
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,320
we haven't done that yet. I mean, the

838
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,920
price point has been there for many

839
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:26,079
years now. It's a there's some kind of

840
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,920
social, uh, thing going on. Um, and it's

841
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,280
not just social stigma or anything

842
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,200
simple. It's u has to do with econ

843
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,000
health economics and and other things,

844
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,160
but I think it will happen soon. Um, so

845
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,119
that's the personal side. And then the

846
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,359
other side is using PGP resources to

847
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,400
help develop things for common diseases.

848
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,400
>> Yeah, great.

849
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:55,200
No questions after such a talk. Casper,

850
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,000
I have I have many more. I can keep

851
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,240
going.

852
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,920
>> Thanks a lot, George. Super inspiring as

853
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,760
always. I was just you made an off-hand

854
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,280
comment uh that I hope I understood

855
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,920
correctly about longevity being more

856
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,240
complex and polygenic which is probably

857
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,520
true than other diseases as I understood

858
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,920
it at least and I was just wondering why

859
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,599
you think longevity in terms of treating

860
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,520
it might be more difficult to treat than

861
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,880
schizophrenia or height I mean we're not

862
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,720
trying to treat height I guess but you

863
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,560
know just why would that be more complex

864
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,119
do you think

865
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,160
>> I think the question uh is uh you

866
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,240
whether I think why do I think uh

867
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,320
longevity be harder than schizophrenia

868
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,720
and other complex diseases. And I think

869
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,680
I misspoke. I actually think that

870
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,400
longevity may be that that all of them

871
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,359
are easier than they look. Um it doesn't

872
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,880
mean that we're going to solve it

873
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,640
tomorrow. I'm not making specific

874
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,960
predictions of when, but I think we have

875
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,040
now exponential technologies. We're

876
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,760
becoming more and more accustomed to

877
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:54,160
doing multiplex editing um and doing,

878
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,720
you know, population in a dish, G-W was

879
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,240
in a dish and all these things. I um and

880
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,480
I think a lot of the solutions we'll

881
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,880
come up with are not just reversal of a

882
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,760
mutation. It's thinking out of the box

883
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:11,760
as to what how the whole system works.

884
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:14,320
Um and uh so no, I don't think longevity

885
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,000
is necessarily hard. I don't want to

886
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,680
misrepresent it as being too easy

887
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,599
either. I mean, it's just it's just

888
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:24,599
plain old science and we're going to get

889
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,599
it done hopefully before you and I die.

890
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,920
Romania,

891
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,520
that was a it was a beautiful talk. It

892
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,200
gives a a lot of hope for the future. I

893
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,720
wanted to kind of focus on a piece at

894
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,960
the end where you're talking about

895
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,079
specifically uh uh going after, you

896
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,760
know, like the pig kidneys, the

897
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,040
engineered pig kidneys. I have a bunch

898
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,680
of people in my life who have chronic

899
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,720
kidney disease and I'm want and and one

900
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,960
of them who is basically at the point of

901
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,240
needing a dialysis and a transplant

902
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,400
doesn't want it because he is basically

903
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,160
saying I would rather die than feel the

904
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,640
than have to take imunosuppressants

905
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,640
every day. So kind of pulling forward

906
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,000
from where we currently are at with the

907
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,160
whole xenotransplantation concept. How

908
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,800
just as like a like a pulse check, how

909
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,880
far do you feel like we are from getting

910
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,960
to a point where you get transplanted an

911
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,200
organ that you know is likely been grown

912
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,119
in in another animal or in a vat, but

913
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,200
then you know it is it is matched to you

914
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,040
immunologically and you don't need

915
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:30,880
long-term uh immune management.

916
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,599
>> Right. Absolutely terrific question. Um

917
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,079
I think most of the patients that I've

918
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,359
run into and heard about uh would far

919
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,520
prefer to have immunosuppressants than

920
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:43,359
dialysis. Dialysis is associated with

921
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,599
brain fog and almost as soon as you

922
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,599
leave the diialysis clinic you start

923
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,599
your start body starts building up

924
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:54,000
toxins and so on. Um that nevertheless

925
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,680
our immediate goal now that we think

926
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,640
that we have something that will work

927
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:00,560
for getting patients off of dialysis is

928
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,640
to get them off of immunosuppressants as

929
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,520
well. And one of the I I mean I can't

930
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,119
tell you what the answer is yet because

931
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:09,760
I don't know but but one of the things

932
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,920
we're trying is to we I said we humanize

933
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,560
these with seven genes. We're going to

934
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,160
try to crank that up to 10,000 genes.

935
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,119
And it's not going to be simple because

936
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,640
there's all kinds of interactions that

937
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:25,040
are species specific, but it's it'll be

938
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,319
an interesting challenge. And this is

939
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,160
how we learn about biology uh is by

940
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,640
trying to do something uh with a very

941
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,319
specific goal in mind and allows us

942
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,000
sometimes to take um shortcut. Um so

943
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:39,680
that's one thing. The other thing is

944
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,480
we're looking at tolerance. Uh so

945
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:47,520
there's there there are some tolerance

946
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:50,560
um experiments that look promising um

947
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,200
and um and all of the tricks that are

948
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,960
being used for allergenic uh cell

949
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,520
therapies

950
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,680
um might be applicable to Zeno as well.

951
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,280
In fact, I think we mutually reinforce

952
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,079
each other that people that are doing

953
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,359
allergenic rather than are saying, well,

954
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,200
if they can do zeno, we can do

955
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:10,000
allergenic

956
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,839
modulo the the uh imunosuppressants. So

957
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,160
anyway, I think there's a few pathways

958
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,160
and we're going as fast as we can on

959
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,800
each of those. I completely agree immune

960
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,800
suppressence is the next thing to do.

961
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:26,760
Yeah. Or get rid of.

962
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,760
>> We have a question back there.

963
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,520
Hello, thank you so much for your time.

964
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,440
So I just wanted to ask because I'm

965
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,680
curious about your thoughts. So as you

966
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,359
discussed AI and machine learning have

967
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,839
shown a lot of promise in improving the

968
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:46,079
drug development process over the past

969
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:48,400
you know decade and even you know even

970
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,160
different applications before that. So

971
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,000
I'm curious, what do you think are the

972
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,839
current limitations in AI and machine

973
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,400
learning applications in drug

974
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,640
development that can and most likely

975
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,640
will be improved in the next few or five

976
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,640
years,

977
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:10,640
>> right? So there's uh there many

978
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,960
limitations uh that are seem to be

979
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,119
falling away quickly. Uh there's a

980
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,800
little bit of hype uh that we need to be

981
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,800
cautious of. Excuse

982
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:28,640
me. And uh you know I would say the um

983
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,040
uh there are two kinds of categories of

984
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,280
where you can apply AI if if you want to

985
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,200
make a dichotomy here. One one is where

986
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,200
you're observing something that's that's

987
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,800
so big you can't reproduce it in the

988
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,960
laboratory. And then there's set of

989
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,960
things that are easy to reproduce and

990
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,200
maybe even make libraries of millions

991
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,800
and billions in the li in the laboratory

992
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,160
that are faithfully represent some

993
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,200
aspect of mechanism or disease or

994
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,040
therapy. Um you know examples of big

995
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,880
things or things that you can you can

996
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,560
see in populations for example are um

997
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,359
but things that you can do in lab which

998
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:06,000
I focused on here even the lab could

999
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:08,640
involve primates humanized primates and

1000
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,440
so forth. I think that AI is limited by

1001
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,520
data uh and especially so in um in h in

1002
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,200
uh human biology

1003
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,760
and one of the things that Laya is doing

1004
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:24,880
differently than I wouldn't say all but

1005
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:27,359
most AI company most AI companies are um

1006
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,800
scraping the internet including PubMed

1007
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,480
and and all sorts of very deep resources

1008
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,560
but most of those resources were not

1009
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,480
designed with AI in mind even though AI

1010
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,319
is very flexible it's not infinitely

1011
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,359
flexible just like human minds are not

1012
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,440
infinitely flexible and anyway so as an

1013
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:46,480
alternative just scraping the internet

1014
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:50,160
and PubMed um we're developing these big

1015
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,920
data sets in house um recognizing that

1016
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,880
almost every new technology that comes

1017
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:58,880
online can almost immediately redo the

1018
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:03,119
last two years of work in its field um

1019
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:06,240
um or I'm sorry last infinity uh in its

1020
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:10,319
field in about two years or less and So,

1021
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:13,119
um I think that's going to be

1022
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:17,240
that is the main problem and it's and

1023
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:17,240
with a very obvious solution.

1024
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,880
>> There's a question back there just

1025
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,160
applauding your statement that data are

1026
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,160
needed to improve AI and models.

1027
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,839
>> Hey George, uh yeah, thanks for the

1028
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,359
great summary of all the amazing

1029
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,280
technology you brought into this world

1030
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,200
together with your lab. It's phenomenal.

1031
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,680
Um my question is about some of the data

1032
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,440
you showed on the longevity. So um you

1033
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:45,760
prolonged I believe it was dogs

1034
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,920
lifespan. Um do they also also health uh

1035
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,839
age healthier because I guess the the

1036
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,400
goal would be to live longer but not to

1037
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:54,000
be sick for longer.

1038
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:57,839
>> Yeah it's a great question. That is our

1039
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,640
goal is not is I is you know reversal of

1040
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:03,040
aging age related is certainly at a

1041
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,040
cellular level the the Yamanaka factors

1042
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,560
do reverse aging. I mean that's that's

1043
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,160
for sure. Um we are that particular

1044
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,680
experiment you're referring to were the

1045
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,680
three of the Yamanaka factors OS and K.

1046
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,760
Uh

1047
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,400
the

1048
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,400
uh the dosing was done very late in

1049
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,839
life. So they were very old and I don't

1050
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:31,200
think there was a well doumented

1051
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:33,200
reversal of those um traits. Um

1052
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,520
it's it's the the field is still young.

1053
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,480
I'm not and you should not be

1054
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,000
discouraged at this point encouraged

1055
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,280
that we got them to live a little bit

1056
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,800
longer. And there and there are multiple

1057
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,680
other experiments I could go on I could

1058
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,480
give an entire talk on work from many uh

1059
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,400
labs that are suddenly getting these uh

1060
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,760
survival curves that are going off far

1061
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,160
to the to the right.

1062
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,319
>> Great. Sorry you have to ask over the

1063
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,040
break. Um we have to cut it off now.

1064
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:04,319
Other than could you give the V2F

1065
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:09,880
community one sentences of what you

1066
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,880
encourage us to think about in embark on

1067
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:20,079
>> unprepared uh but uh uh I would say a AI

1068
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,880
especially coupled with with large

1069
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:26,960
libraries um to the extent you can do it

1070
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:29,200
in um humanized as close to human as

1071
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,000
possible we've even used deedent models

1072
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,599
where we have humans that whose uh

1073
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,920
surviving family have given permission

1074
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,520
for the their body to be used science.

1075
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,920
That's as close that's really as close

1076
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:43,119
as you can get without putting a human

1077
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:46,480
at risk. So humanized primates and

1078
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,800
deedants I think uh are key component

1079
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,920
for but you want to get as much data as

1080
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,640
possible out of each of those

1081
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,319
experiments. It shouldn't just be a one

1082
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,880
dose, one drug per

1083
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,560
>> Yeah.

1084
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:01,119
>> Because primates and humans are

1085
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:02,800
extremely uh precious um resources. So

1086
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:08,000
we try to get at least a million

1087
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:10,480
different uh drugs and multiple data

1088
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,280
