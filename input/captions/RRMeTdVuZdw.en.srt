1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,559
Um, my name is Dr. Phil Button. Um, I'm

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,800
going to introduce the panel here.

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,840
Before I do so, uh, while the chairs are

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,480
being set up, I'm just going to give you

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,880
some basic slides. Um, the way they

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,199
describe the MIT education is drinking

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,720
from the fire hose, which means lots of

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,880
stuff coming at you. So, I'm going to

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,559
try to replicate that by cramming

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,399
several pieces into the next five

11
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,520
minutes that'll give you some sort of

12
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,200
background to help you with the um

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,040
understand the panelists that we have

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,920
assembled. And it really is an amazing

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,079
panel. So, I'm a former government

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,239
diplomat. I'm now a senior lecturer at

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,719
MIT, which is MIT code for not a

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,559
professor, but I work with a professor,

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,920
Dame Fiona Murray, who will be beaming

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,280
in later. Uh we we hope. But my job this

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,160
morning is to say something very quickly

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,920
on innovation and ecosystems. I'm at the

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,119
Sloan School of Management, which is

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,720
MIT's School of Management. And to the

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,960
extent that we have impact in the world,

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,760
it's because we are strapped to that

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,000
rocket ship that is the engineering and

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,200
science schools. And we're delighted to

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,040
be there with our with our friends. So,

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,880
uh this is me. I realize this is a

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,520
picture from before the pandemic, before

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,040
my hair went gray and the eyesight uh

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,960
faded. So sorry if anybody doesn't

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,080
recognize me. I keep that up there for

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,159
for vanity. Uh having been a diplomat, I

36
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,000
remain a diplomatic adviser. But as you

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,079
can tell from my accent, I am delighted

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,920
to be back here in Britain and so

39
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,799
pleased to have such senior MIT

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,119
leadership uh with us here. We actually

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,040
are having an alumni event of MIT

42
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,399
alumni. So these amazing students that

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,560
you were hearing about from Chancellor

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,159
Nobles, uh they go on and do amazing

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,079
things in the world. It's amazing how

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,159
many banks they seem to run here in the

47
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,479
city of London. uh they're able to turn

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,200
their engineering mathematics skills to

49
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,719
optimizing all kinds of portfolios. So

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,960
it's wonderful that Chancellor Nobles

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,680
will be here. U it's the 75th

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,239
anniversary of the AMIT alumni club and

53
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,879
it is we believe the largest alumni club

54
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,400
outside of the United States. Um some of

55
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,840
them are Brits but many of them from

56
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,280
other parts of the world. They just call

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,640
London this global gateway their home.

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,720
So I'm going to do two quick things.

59
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,680
Innovation then ecosystems. Prepare to

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,440
drink from the fire hose. Um the

61
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,120
previous MIT president launched

62
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,120
something called the MIT innovation

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,640
initiative. As good academics the first

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,200
thing they had to do was define their

65
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,760
terms. What do we mean by innovation?

66
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,840
And as chancellor Nobles and Gayatri

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,519
have said uh the MIT innovation

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,920
initiative signed off on the definition

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,640
of take the process of taking ideas from

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,280
inception to impact. It's a broad

71
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,040
definition of innovation. We at MIT

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,519
particularly like to take the technology

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,440
aspects of it, but we don't forget the

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,480
human side of it. Leading an

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,000
organization, changing the culture. Um

76
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,680
there's a whole series of ways to

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,440
innovate. It's not only for-profit

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
organizations, it's also for not

79
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,599
for-profit purposes. And it's amazing as

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,440
the chancellor was saying how motivated

81
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,560
our young students are about some of the

82
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,400
bigger issues in the world. We like to

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,920
think about innovation in a variety of

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,360
ways on a problem solution matrix. Uh a

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,360
lot of people think innovation is just

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,440
out at the far horizon and something

87
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,519
really really distant and far away from

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,400
their business as usual BAU in the

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,080
bottom left. Yes. And MIT is one of

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,720
those places on the planet that is doing

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,799
amazing things out at the far frontier.

92
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,799
One of my favorite cyberpunk quotes from

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,239
William Gibson is that the future is

94
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,040
already here. It's not evenly

95
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,280
distributed. MIT is one of those places

96
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,280
on the planet and London has some as

97
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,519
well where that far future is being

98
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,120
created. So that's what we like to call

99
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:52,159
big eye innovation. Quantum decryption,

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,480
encryption, sensing, fusion. People used

101
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,200
to put AI out there until it snuck up on

102
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,560
us and came over the the close horizon.

103
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,239
But there's another form of innovation

104
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,920
which is little eye innovation. You may

105
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,239
not be working on quantum computers

106
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,159
yourself, but there's still a need to

107
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,560
innovate even if it feels like more

108
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,159
modest 10% little eye innovation.

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,879
The interesting thing about little eye

110
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,040
innovation is that is more easily done

111
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,560
by large organizations like governments

112
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,199
and corporates. I'm not sure if you can

113
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,400
see the slides behind the chairs. Um but

114
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,680
there is a little government and a

115
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,840
little corporate down there. And I work

116
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,400
a lot with the public sector, we heard

117
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,639
from Ed, but also large organizations.

118
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,800
Uh they are different in some ways, but

119
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,040
they're also large organizations with

120
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,880
bureaucracy, with culture, with politics

121
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,800
that are really slow to adopt things. So

122
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,120
it turns out large organizations by

123
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,520
their nature are much better at little

124
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,360
eye innovation

125
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,520
which is why we turn to ecosystems.

126
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,520
We research this around the world

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,080
particularly through a reap program.

128
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,600
Every one of these pins is a team uh

129
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,680
with which we have worked around the

130
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,680
world. The eagle-eyed will have spotted

131
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,240
that yes we did back in the day work

132
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,840
with communist China and Putin's Russia

133
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,520
but closer to home we've also worked

134
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,720
with a wonderful team Wales. It's

135
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,960
wonderful to have Matt here from the

136
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,880
Welsh government. um we have worked with

137
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,960
this around the world and so what I'm

138
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,479
sharing with you is not only MIT

139
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,800
research but also stuff that we have

140
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,960
tried in the real world and it turns out

141
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,680
that it's quite a secular phenomenon

142
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,680
which is fancy professor speak that the

143
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,000
same process of technology innovation

144
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,199
applies whether you're in communist

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,120
China or disorganized Latin America

146
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,960
whether you're in Western Europe or

147
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Southeast Asia because it's humans

148
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,080
adopting to tech adapting to technology

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,919
ology.

150
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,759
20 years ago, this American journalist

151
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,680
told us the world is flat, which came

152
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,759
shortly after the end of history, the

153
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,479
death of distance, peace in the Middle

154
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,320
East, and Russia as a democratic nation.

155
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,680
Um, one needs to be a little bit careful

156
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,759
of these books. This one is the most

157
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,280
upsetting uh because it promised that

158
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,280
innovation could happen anywhere. The

159
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,600
world is flat and yet we know from our

160
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,759
reap program that it doesn't happen

161
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
evenly across the planet.

162
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,919
Entrepreneurship may be evenly

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,479
distributed. uh we had an amazing team

164
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,919
from Lebanon hugely entrepreneurial but

165
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,560
for some reason they weren't getting the

166
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,319
same uh outcomes as say Silicon Valley

167
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,560
and this is where the ecosystem becomes

168
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,120
important now while Freriedman was

169
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,759
saying this in 2005 others like Richard

170
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,000
Florida looked saw through this and said

171
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,400
the world of innovation is not flat here

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,360
they're using patents as a proxy from 20

173
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,960
years ago um you know there's various

174
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,360
proxies for innovation but it's clear

175
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,360
the world is not flat and so this

176
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,280
inspires us to understand where are the

177
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,400
places on the planet that are good that

178
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,240
are spiky London Boston Silicon Valley

179
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,360
but also we work with lots of re lots of

180
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,600
regions around the world who are trying

181
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,080
to catch up with that who are trying to

182
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,080
understand how can we be included uh

183
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,479
we've had some amazing teams in reap

184
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,199
from West Africa they are no less

185
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,800
entrepreneurial um they are as out there

186
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,800
as they need to be as entrepreneurs but

187
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,880
they are failed by the ecosystem around

188
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,479
them and so understanding what they can

189
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,120
ask from the other stakeholders is

190
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,039
really matter really matters

191
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,599
So the MIT professors have come up with

192
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,039
a five model stakeholder approach and

193
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,199
apologies for anybody who's been through

194
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,919
the reap program who may be getting uh

195
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,560
flashbacks to this. Um the thing about

196
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,039
this MIT model is it goes beyond the

197
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,880
traditional triple helix. They used to

198
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,560
say that all you needed was big

199
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,280
university, big government, big

200
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,680
corporate and you would get innovation.

201
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,000
Now our friends from team Belgium in

202
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,759
reap have tested this to destruction. If

203
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,360
you could be the world's most innovative

204
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,520
place on the planet by having committee

205
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,440
meetings of big university, big

206
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,000
government, big corporate, Wonia would

207
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,639
be the most uh powerfully intellectually

208
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,400
place in the world. Uh it's not. And

209
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,919
this is why I love the MIT professors.

210
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,160
They've brought two other people to the

211
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,319
table whose voices need to be heard. The

212
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,360
entrepreneur put them at the top of the

213
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
table. It's hard to have an

214
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,560
entrepreneurial ecosystem without

215
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,280
entrepreneurs.

216
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,680
Um Fiona Murray designed this. So she

217
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,240
makes two points. One, it's a team. It's

218
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,199
very rarely a lone individual. You know,

219
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,360
the Zuckerberg in his hoodie is the

220
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,479
exception. Don't be distracted by the

221
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,720
American myths. It takes a team and this

222
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,400
one happens to be femaleled, but we do

223
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,840
know from research that boys can be

224
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,560
entrepreneurs, too. So, you are

225
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,720
included. The important thing is it is a

226
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,800
team. And we see the most most

227
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,680
impressive startups coming out of MIT

228
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,479
are the ones with teams. The other new

229
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,840
category here is risk capital and this

230
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,279
is important because we have a risk

231
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,440
capital provider uh on our panel. So the

232
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,039
MIT uh modern venture capital was

233
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,479
invented in uh 1946 in Boston uh a

234
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,399
variant when then went to Silicon

235
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,160
Valley. One of the reasons the MIT

236
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,240
professors don't use the term venture

237
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,560
capital uh they go back to the original

238
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,040
risk capital term was venture capital is

239
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,880
now so associated with Silicon Valley

240
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,600
that a lot of people think that it's the

241
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,440
10 years closed fund but actually for

242
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
the VCs to maintain their expensive

243
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,920
lifestyle they really need to get in and

244
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,399
out in three years uh they've got a lot

245
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,279
of gilelets to buy they've got Nappa

246
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,959
wine you know bless them um they've

247
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,000
ended up optimizing on digital asset

248
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,080
light, employee light, quick in and out,

249
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,959
blitz scale, hypers scale, lots of

250
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,399
American terms. Um, the MIT professors

251
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,920
prefer risk capital because it's

252
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,080
definitely putting money at risk like

253
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,800
venture capital in contrast to

254
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,600
traditional corporate banking or private

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,040
equity with its debt laden approach. Um,

256
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,760
but it could be more patient than

257
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,120
Silicon Valley venture capital. It turns

258
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,000
out you need people who are going to

259
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,880
invest in biotech which could take 10

260
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,200
years to produce something. Uh a lot of

261
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,160
the remediation for the climate crisis

262
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,600
is going to come not from a digital app.

263
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,320
It's actually going to come from doing

264
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,440
hard things, tough tech, hard tech, deep

265
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,600
tech. Uh great example is the pandemic.

266
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Silicon Valley optimized for digital

267
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,000
gave us some fascinating digital dance

268
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,760
apps and it certainly keep us occupied.

269
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
It was the Boston area that actually

270
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,360
gave us a COVID vaccine. Turns out the

271
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,080
vaccines are quite useful in a pandemic.

272
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,000
Um, but somebody had to invest in that

273
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,920
and it looked like an overnight success

274
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,320
to those who weren't paying attention.

275
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,200
But Madena was actually 10 years of

276
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,680
working on voodoo science to get it

277
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,200
through to a vaccine technology. So

278
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,680
different ecosystems are going to be

279
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,519
good at different things. And the

280
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,240
world's best ecosystems are where the

281
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,600
top three, the apex three are involved

282
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,680
because they're much better at

283
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,839
transformative big eye innovation.

284
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,680
So bringing the two together as we work

285
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,519
with ecosystems around the world, we've

286
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,200
worked with London, uh, Northern

287
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,120
Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Leeds. Um, it

288
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,120
turns out that the best innovation

289
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,440
ecosystems are the ones where you have

290
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,040
all five stakeholders involved because

291
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,640
while the large organizations of

292
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,760
government and corporate are better at

293
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,040
the modest little eye innovation, you

294
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,800
need people who are going to be out

295
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,040
there thinking the big thoughts of the

296
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,279
big eye. And from Chancellor Nobles,

297
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,600
you'll have got a sense of our students

298
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,640
who just don't seem to sleep. They seem

299
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,399
to operate on ramen and and Red Bull.

300
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,000
They are constantly working on things.

301
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,000
They finish their amazing homework and

302
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
then they start up a company. I just

303
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,480
feel so inadequate. My student

304
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,399
experience about 100 years ago was not

305
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,560
spent starting up companies and working

306
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,079
on technologies unlike these kids. you

307
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,480
really do want to see if you can land an

308
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,320
MIT student because they are special and

309
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,640
they are part of what creates these

310
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,399
groundbreaking entrepreneurs.

311
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,640
So, we've written some of this up. My

312
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,959
boss Fiona Mario and I will be on later.

313
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,399
Uh so, if after going through this

314
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,920
rattling through here, you have any

315
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,839
further interest, please do read about

316
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,079
this because there's a role for people

317
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,640
in large corporations and the public

318
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,959
sector to tap into this innovation that

319
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,040
is out there in the ecosystem. It's a

320
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,079
source of competitive advantage. If you

321
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,000
don't do it, other companies will and

322
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,760
innovation really will decide winners

323
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,560
and losers. So, we encourage you to

324
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,480
engage those. But with that, I'd now

325
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,079
like to introduce our panel and I am

326
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,000
delighted that we have a representative

327
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,120
of Risk Capital, a representative from

328
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,720
the corporate sector and an

329
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,800
entrepreneur. So, with a round of

330
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,680
applause, please welcome Wed Alan and

331
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,680
Pderi to the stage.

332
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,120
Excellent. And if you could make my life

333
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,320
simple by Predereari, you come sit by

334
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,839
me. Alan, you're in the middle. Wid,

335
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,680
you're at the far end. I know I'm

336
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,600
supposed to sit down, but I'm highly

337
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,519
caffeinated and jet-lagged. So, I'm just

338
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,200
going to stand up here for a moment. Um,

339
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,560
what I'm going to do is first a

340
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,639
lightning round where you get to

341
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,880
introduce yourselves. Wid I will start

342
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,639
with you. One of the reasons I set out

343
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,480
the MIT approach is to understand that

344
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,399
we have put together a multistakeholder

345
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,560
panel here to get a sense of the

346
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,600
different people. But Wed, one of our

347
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,360
star MIT students, alums, a leader here

348
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,760
in the London area. Can you give us a

349
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,800
minute on yourself and Soho Capital?

350
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,760
>> So, uh, I'm one of the nerds that you've

351
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,600
mentioned before. Uh,

352
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,680
>> and life wasn't that exciting. I'll tell

353
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,880
you that much at MIT was a lot worse

354
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,880
than it sounds. Uh

355
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,720
but coming back to it so since my days

356
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,560
of MIT uh we've been through the

357
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,120
entrepreneurial journey uh worked in

358
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,519
banking consulting and over the last 15

359
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,000
20 years we've built up a business in

360
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,160
the UK market that started in the equity

361
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,760
world really risk capital and then

362
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,000
transitioned into sort of a structured

363
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,240
capital model that tries to sort of

364
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
balance the risk and rewards that are in

365
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,160
the market and also take advantage of

366
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,120
the inefficiencies that we see in this

367
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,839
market. Uh, a lot of what we do,

368
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,240
interestingly enough, we are focused on

369
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,160
downside protection on credit, but the

370
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,800
key thing that keeps all of our

371
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,519
companies alive is growth. And our focus

372
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,360
is on understanding what drives these

373
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,000
entrepreneurs, how do you get innovation

374
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,079
into them? Because eventually what we

375
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,920
see is the most entrepreneurial

376
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,720
companies really are able to create

377
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,040
breakout scenarios that we don't expect

378
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,560
and that's what's over is looking for.

379
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,519
>> Excellent. And before I turn to Alan, we

380
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,760
are going to come back to you when we

381
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,880
get into the uh substantive part. I'm

382
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,480
going to ask you about growth,

383
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,399
particularly here as we're at ILOP's

384
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,320
London Symposium. Given your

385
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,920
international experience, how is London

386
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,839
and and Britain doing? And and don't

387
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,519
hold back.

388
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,120
>> Alan, you're here representing the

389
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,199
corporate sector, the the acceptable

390
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,800
face of industry. Tell us about where.

391
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,000
>> It would appear so. Um yeah, Alan

392
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,000
Stewart. I'm the group head of

393
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,279
innovation at research at the Weir group

394
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,800
where I have now been for 21 years. We

395
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:44,480
are is an organization of 152 years uh

396
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,399
of age where we have innovated for all

397
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,160
of those years and to remain relevant to

398
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,320
the industries that we're in. In my 21

399
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,480
years we've been in power, we've been in

400
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,000
oil and gas and more recently we are

401
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,760
positioning ourselves as a mining

402
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
technology company. We really want to

403
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,519
play our part in making mining more

404
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,519
sustainable. What weird does from a a

405
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,000
product perspective is we are involved

406
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,000
in extraction and benification and

407
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,560
tailings management. So we make hard

408
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,480
capital equipment that consumes huge

409
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,880
amounts of energy and huge amounts of of

410
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,120
uh water in order to give us the the

411
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,760
commodities that we want for to drive

412
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,399
technology. I guess copper um rare earth

413
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,680
elements, iron ore, gold to to name but

414
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,120
a few.

415
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,399
>> Excellent. Well, thank you for that. I'm

416
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,040
so pleased that we have a corporate from

417
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,279
the hard sectors like mining. We at MIT

418
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,800
really do like our our deep tech and the

419
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,639
things that are going to matter in in

420
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,839
the future. With that, Praderi,

421
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,680
wonderful to have you here. you

422
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,320
represent all of entrepreneurs in the

423
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,600
world. Um tell us tell us about which

424
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,560
part of the world you're from and

425
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,360
MSpark.

426
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,360
>> Yeah. So um hi everyone. I'm the

427
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,160
managing director over at MSpark. So,

428
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,199
Menai Science Park um upon Anduly in

429
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,519
North Wales and uh I guess we're focused

430
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,839
on the complete reap model and bringing

431
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,680
all those actors together and enjoying

432
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,480
life uh I guess in what we call the

433
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,639
messy middle of all that where all that

434
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
interaction is and uh if we can get that

435
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,279
interaction going,

436
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,880
>> we can see some amazing things

437
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,079
happening. So, that's that's where we

438
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,120
enjoy ourselves really.

439
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,040
>> Excellent. Well, thank you for coming

440
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,959
and bringing a a contingent from North

441
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,160
Wales and the Welsh government just to

442
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,399
make sure there's no trouble here in

443
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,959
London. Uh, we appreciate the travel.

444
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,920
Um, so as promised, well, back to you.

445
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:24,320
We're here. Um, you take a hard-headed

446
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,959
perspective of the world. How is the

447
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,959
United Kingdom? How is London doing in

448
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,120
terms of its productivity and the way it

449
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,759
creates those growth companies out of

450
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,680
innovation ecosystems? I if you think

451
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,920
about

452
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,360
how this is break how it breaks down you

453
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,959
have the Gaussian curve in the middle

454
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,160
you have a distribution productive

455
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,839
company and that's always been a

456
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,120
question we've been trying to understand

457
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,120
is EK more productive less productive

458
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,360
and you know as somebody said you know

459
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,240
to every complex answer there's simple

460
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,399
clear solution that's always wrong uh

461
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,079
the answer here

462
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,680
is if you think about it what we have

463
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,199
when we hire somebody to do a study for

464
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,639
us and we end up having this calcium

465
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,039
curve in the middle Okay, we're less

466
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,480
productive than France because we employ

467
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,919
more people per unit of

468
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,520
>> you know that's bad news in this crowd

469
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,439
that we're worse than France.

470
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,640
>> But they have they made the trade-off of

471
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:17,120
capital versus people. So they have 7%

472
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,799
unemployment. We have 4%. That's the

473
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,160
difference really in that productivity.

474
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,160
But then something interesting happens

475
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,919
at the tail end of the curve. You get

476
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,360
super highly productive companies that

477
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,919
are there. I mean if you go back to

478
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,240
Haldane's 2011 paper, that is basically

479
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,400
what he identifies as super breakout

480
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,240
players. And that's really tells you

481
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,480
that actually is that the same

482
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,480
everywhere else? Is it just that we're

483
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,400
not seeing enough of those companies or

484
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,559
do they end up growing at a certain

485
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,799
stage and then navigating to the US and

486
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,240
basically continuing their growth there?

487
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,200
I don't haven't seen a lot of that

488
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,400
research there. Uh in our part which is

489
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,760
call it middle market less late stage

490
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,600
tech businesses uh you do see some

491
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,200
really interesting companies.

492
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,520
I I was at a business awards uh uh event

493
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,840
judging uh companies about two weeks

494
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,520
ago. Every one of those companies was

495
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,080
really really interesting.

496
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,039
>> I mean you found a gardening business

497
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,960
that's now making a 100 million of I

498
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,720
mean who would have thought right and

499
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,960
they're driving through innovation in

500
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,240
terms of hiring the people. So there is

501
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,640
innovation in this market but as a whole

502
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,360
nation the question is you're capped by

503
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,160
your GDP growth and the GDP in the UK is

504
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,960
not sexy right we're growing at a low

505
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,480
rate you're trying to extract value out

506
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,559
of what you have and what you find is

507
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,720
that the most innovative companies are

508
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,720
not necessarily creating new markets or

509
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,720
taking markets away from other things

510
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,280
you know from other players and that

511
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,000
becomes a more difficult thing to mash

512
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,679
uh when we're looking at the companies

513
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,600
And growth is an important part of it

514
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,559
because the way we say to our investors

515
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,960
is you know growth is the pulse of a

516
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,200
business. A business with no organic

517
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,600
growth doesn't have a pulse and that to

518
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,679
us is not an investable proposition.

519
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,120
>> But when we look at them we also look at

520
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,280
the measures and what we see is sort of

521
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,919
a bit of

522
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,600
tepidness in terms of willingness to

523
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,720
take risk. And I'm not sure if it's a

524
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,600
function of a risk capital market that

525
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,360
has basically said we're not going to

526
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,799
reward you for that much growth because

527
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,679
we don't believe that if you take that

528
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,919
risk you will get rewarded. Uh there's

529
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,600
another issue that we see that we have

530
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,679
companies in the UK and we have similar

531
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,760
companies in US servicing the same

532
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,240
clients but the US clients are willing

533
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:38,000
to pay five six percentage points of

534
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,919
margin more than the UK. So even if you

535
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,080
are innovating, can your clients in the

536
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,120
UK afford it? I mean the perception that

537
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,760
the US is a very competitive market. I

538
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,919
think it's got nothing on the UK. The UK

539
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,840
market because it's smaller. You have

540
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,760
very good companies. It's hyper

541
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,480
competitive. If you've ever dealt with

542
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,360
the procurement uh side of some of the

543
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,880
larger corporates, it's brutal. There's

544
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,880
little margin that they will let you

545
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,919
have to grow. And even if you provide

546
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,440
them with a value add service that may

547
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,960
win you the contract, but they're not

548
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,280
going to necessarily reward you with a

549
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,200
higher margin to go and innovate again

550
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,919
and add to it. So you have to take more

551
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,600
and more of that risk.

552
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,520
There's also the last element, right?

553
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,080
What we see is possibly this is due to

554
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,559
people like me who are buying these

555
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,880
companies out too early of a stage to

556
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:30,480
let them create enough wealth and value.

557
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,760
So we say sometimes glibly to our uh

558
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,760
CEOs like you know in in the UK a

559
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,520
manager will grow a business or an owner

560
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,400
will grow a business and sell it and buy

561
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,280
a house in the country in the US an

562
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,280
owner will grow his business and then go

563
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,200
and buy a country that's the difference

564
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,159
of ambition

565
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,840
excellent thank you for that uh yes so I

566
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,000
can tell an MIT speaker where you start

567
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,640
off with you know Gaussian graphs and

568
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
how dane's 2011 report and then by by

569
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,640
the end you're giving us this, you know,

570
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,640
UK GDP is not sexy and and the contrast

571
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,120
between the UK and and US. So, thank you

572
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,880
for getting us started. Turning now to

573
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,200
the large companies, how does it feel to

574
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,799
be in this hyper competitive market and

575
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,120
you're the head of innov group head of

576
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,480
innovation? So, how do you find working

577
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,960
with these companies and and keeping

578
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,159
their margins tight? I think the first

579
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,919
thing we recognized as a corporate was

580
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,600
we there's an ecosystem out there and

581
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,159
there's a startup economy out there that

582
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,240
will get us to the margins and the

583
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,799
growth that we want quicker. It probably

584
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,039
took us of those 152 years about 150 of

585
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,200
those years to realize that. Uh I think

586
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,320
we suffered very much from the and I

587
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,880
don't know if it's a British thing a

588
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,559
Scottish thing if it's not built here we

589
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,480
don't believe it's real. So there was a

590
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:47,280
real internal um governance that just of

591
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,120
of almost distrust. Um in the last two

592
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,799
years that's changed quite dramatically.

593
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,799
You know mining is an industry that's

594
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,799
going to be under great strain from a a

595
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,799
productivity perspective. The demand for

596
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,480
copper over the next 30 years is going

597
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,159
to be greater than it's been over the

598
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,159
last 3,000 years. So we're going to have

599
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,679
to mine more copper. And I think that

600
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,640
was the kind of penny drop moment for

601
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,720
sort of big corporates within my sector

602
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,640
was they they don't have the capital.

603
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,600
they don't have the risk appetite. They

604
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,159
don't um have the the the patience

605
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,440
perhaps to to do it themselves. And I

606
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,840
think that's where it actually creates

607
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,000
more opportunity. I think that there's

608
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,320
never been a lack of ingenuity,

609
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,480
entrepreneurship in the UK or or further

610
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,000
a field. It's been the pathway to impact

611
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,919
being critical for me and that's the

612
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,080
part that corporates have had to change

613
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,720
how we play instead of pushing the

614
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,640
supply chain to ek out that last 2% of

615
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,240
of margin. And you know, you you don't

616
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,000
sort of cut yourself to greatness on

617
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,480
that death spiral. You've got to have

618
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,559
the confidence to to invest. You can

619
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,240
derisk that investment through through

620
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,640
startups. You can

621
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,159
>> um afford to fail. It's we can afford to

622
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,159
fail through startups. Maybe sounds a

623
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,520
little bit harsh, but but the impact of

624
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,799
that failure and the culture of that

625
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,600
failure bring startups big back stronger

626
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,200
with um with better kind of confidence

627
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,360
and the lessons learned to to pick

628
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,120
themselves up and go again. So, so I'm

629
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,600
always been more of a glass half full

630
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,320
kind of guy, but I think corporates have

631
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,159
to forget the last sort of 150 years of

632
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,080
we are evolution and look at the pathway

633
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,440
that we believe we're on and also

634
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,360
recognize the value that you bring to

635
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,240
startups as well within that that

636
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,159
ecosystem where um it's difficult being

637
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,720
a startup. We've spoken to loads over

638
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,720
the the last two three years and I think

639
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,720
it's it's incumbent on us to create that

640
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,559
pathway to impact and really crude

641
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,640
language. you know, bolt their equipment

642
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,559
onto our equipment to make it better is

643
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,480
the low-risk pathway which is in a very

644
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,480
conservative industry which mining and

645
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,120
other large capital equipment industries

646
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,720
are.

647
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,760
>> Well, that that's wonderful and I look

648
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,000
forward when we come back to hearing

649
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,000
more about how you change that that

650
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,240
culture inside the corporation to mean

651
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,520
that you could get innovation from from

652
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,039
outside and one of the things I love

653
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,960
about the fact that you're in now in in

654
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,480
mining. This is not just about you know

655
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,919
and British Telecoms is known as being a

656
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,600
leader for leading leaning into

657
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,120
technology and working with startups but

658
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,280
it's also possible in really hard

659
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,919
sectors like like mining as well. It's

660
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,559
important. So we have with us a live

661
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,559
entrepreneur from the startup community.

662
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,600
Uh thank you for joining us. You never

663
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,120
know with the entrepreneur whether

664
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,960
they're going to make it to the panel.

665
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,559
Um Praderi clearly we are strong at

666
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,080
innovation and entrepreneurship.

667
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,559
Corporates are understanding the benefit

668
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,159
of tapping into your startups. How do

669
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,159
things work? uh look from your

670
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,159
perspective in in mspark the

671
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,679
entrepreneurial community and how is it

672
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,279
to easy to work with these types of

673
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,039
people? I guess just listening to the

674
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,279
panelists just now it's refreshing to

675
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,240
hear that because from our perspective

676
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:38,480
um there's a few gateways there Phil if

677
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,720
I'm totally honest with you it's

678
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,480
>> Alan it's refreshing to hear that you

679
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,559
you are looking for startups you are

680
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,080
engaging because I guess our story is

681
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,679
slightly different we're trying to open

682
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,360
those doors we're knocking doors we're

683
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,840
having those conversations

684
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,000
>> but we're seeing that lack of appetite

685
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,120
for risk we're seeing the cultural

686
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,520
barriers perhaps um although when you do

687
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,960
see the corporates, they really really

688
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,000
want to engage. Um maybe they just don't

689
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,520
know how.

690
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,679
>> What is it? They don't know how or maybe

691
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,840
they don't want to. I'm not quite sure

692
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,799
uh where it is. They definitely want to

693
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,799
innovate, but uh as you said at the

694
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,440
beginning, maybe Phil, there's a there's

695
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,559
a balance there that as they grow, they

696
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,360
get caught up in this business as usual.

697
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,600
>> It's incremental innovation. And if they

698
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,840
were to engage, I guess that's my call

699
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,520
uh this morning really uh for for the

700
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,760
corporates for the risk capital do

701
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,039
engage and even outside of London

702
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,520
there's interesting things that's

703
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,799
happening.

704
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,000
>> What believe it or not there's amazing

705
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,240
companies uh out there. So engage and um

706
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,799
I'm sure you'll be surprised but there

707
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,320
is a cultural barrier that we've seen

708
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,200
and that's that's our experience

709
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,279
unfortunately.

710
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,640
>> Sure. and a cultural baren. The fact

711
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,760
that you've come here from North Wales,

712
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,600
one of the things we discovered from

713
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,679
from Reap Team Wales and Reap Team

714
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,840
Scotland is there are entrepreneurial

715
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,240
people across this amazing United

716
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,240
Kingdom. And so it's not just in London

717
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,240
or the Golden Triangle. Sometimes the

718
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,000
startup with the technology you need

719
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,159
could be could be somewhere else. So

720
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
thank you for coming in. Um I wanted to

721
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,840
go back to Alan. It it sounds like the

722
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,559
corporate startup relationship is not

723
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,960
the easiest one. uh the MIT professors

724
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,159
designed the the pentacle with the

725
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,440
corporate and the startup sort of

726
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,000
opposed to each other because it's a

727
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,240
tricky relationship. How did this

728
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,320
ancient uh company of yours we're not

729
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,480
you you're not ancient we are. How did

730
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,799
your ancient company however compared to

731
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,720
the age of predi startup enterprises how

732
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,559
did it change its organization to be

733
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,080
able to work with startups? So first of

734
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,520
all I think the pentacle I wish I'd seen

735
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,720
that a few years ago I think we would

736
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,320
have been further onto our journey

737
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,159
because um we very much being engineers

738
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,000
being an engineering le organization we

739
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,559
learn through doing and we learn through

740
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,799
getting things wrong I think what

741
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,240
changed our mind was a couple of things

742
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,240
just recognizing the challenges that

743
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,000
we're going to face our industry

744
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,080
recognizing there's amalgam of of

745
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,240
technologies beyond just making product

746
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,440
bigger and making product smarter which

747
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,000
was again a zeitgeist of the time um and

748
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,799
And we we always knew that our culture

749
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,080
wasn't the most nimble or most agile,

750
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,679
but I think a lot of it came through

751
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,240
learning. I used to joke that by the

752
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,559
time we had raised an NDA to work with a

753
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,400
startup, they'd IPOed. You know, they

754
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,640
live through their life cycle. Um and

755
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:25,440
and we recognized through failure that

756
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:28,080
we had to address that. Um so 2020 2013

757
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,360
we set up the advanced research center

758
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,919
which was while it's part of the

759
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,440
corporate function it has its own

760
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,120
ecosystem it own culture its own

761
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,760
environment we purposefully are based at

762
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,279
a university site so we are we have

763
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,960
those horrible expression knowledge

764
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,559
accidents we're walking through the

765
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,880
technology innovation center and there's

766
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,559
a quantum uh there's a quantum

767
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,679
conference going on or there there's

768
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,080
just something that sparks that

769
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,400
enthusiasm also through recruitment we

770
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,760
we didn't have 21 years and kind of

771
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,520
institutionalized. We recognized we

772
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,799
needed a mix of both. We needed people

773
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,399
that understood our industry. They

774
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,240
understood our products, but you also

775
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:04,399
had to merge that with outside in views.

776
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,159
Um, but it was that kind of people and

777
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,600
culture piece were critical. And also

778
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,559
think senior leadership. You know, we've

779
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,000
got very uh stable executive who I

780
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,159
report into our chief strategy and

781
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,520
sustainability officer. Um, we

782
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,520
understood the importance of technology

783
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,000
to our strategy, but we also understood

784
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,600
how much energy, water, etc. was going

785
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,360
to be consumed by mining over the the

786
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,480
coming years and and kind of holding the

787
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,880
mirror up and being quite honest that

788
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,880
you don't have that capability yourself.

789
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,320
Yes, we employed some consultants. Yes,

790
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,240
we took views from from other

791
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,320
industries. But part of it was was

792
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,760
failing, realizing you need to change

793
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,000
and get in the right people in the right

794
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,840
place and empowering them, letting us

795
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,520
feel not that we're going to fail, but

796
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,039
we can get things wrong. We'll allow our

797
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,919
startups to fail. But be quite

798
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,320
reflective.

799
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,000
>> Yeah.

800
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,679
>> But it's I stress we're we're two years

801
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
into that journey. We're

802
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,279
>> we've got a few battle scars for the 150

803
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,559
before.

804
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,159
>> Well, first of all, and before I turn

805
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,000
back to Perry, first of all,

806
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,600
congratulations on making that change

807
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,440
from our work with large organizations,

808
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,600
which is the focus of our book. It's

809
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,440
really hard to show that leadership that

810
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,960
you need to work with ideas that are not

811
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,039
just invented inside your own

812
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,799
organization. And that's true for uh

813
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,559
for-profit organizations. It's true for

814
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,240
government organizations. But the fact

815
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,919
you're willing to work with startups

816
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,399
predi from your experience in the

817
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,480
startup community I've not heard many

818
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,559
corporates willing to talk this way how

819
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,159
would you encourage corporates to engage

820
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,080
with the great entrepreneurs you have

821
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,600
>> well engage with the ecosystem isn't it

822
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,000
and I'd like to think if you're engaging

823
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,919
with an ecosystem you you'll get to know

824
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,960
the startups um you'll get to know

825
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,559
government you'll get to know

826
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,480
universities and it sounds like you've

827
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,720
got that within a room or within a

828
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,399
building. though that's a that's an

829
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,320
amazing thing to hear and maybe the

830
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,120
other the message I'm I'm hearing from

831
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,159
uh Alan over here is that um that risk

832
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,399
appetite

833
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,399
>> failure is expected was on your slide

834
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:51,120
earlier on and um there's absolutely

835
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,279
nothing wrong with that is there but

836
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,600
>> yeah some sometimes that risk appetite

837
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,279
isn't there that expectation or failure

838
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,960
isn't there so

839
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,559
>> there's a cultural shift that we need to

840
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:05,760
to see uh I guess towards that sort of

841
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:08,080
risk appetite but um engaging is crucial

842
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,240
and uh the reap model gives you all the

843
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,240
ingredients that you need and as science

844
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,159
parks innovation ecosystems you can

845
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,240
easily access that it's all there for

846
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,640
you and that's our job really in making

847
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,000
that as accessible as possible

848
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,880
>> so if we're not doing that we're not

849
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,559
doing it correctly

850
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,919
>> well brilliant thank you for that and

851
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,919
I'm going to turn to wedd as we're

852
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,840
talking about risk and he's Mr. risk

853
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,320
capital can ask him about funding these

854
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,760
sorts of uh engagements. But just to

855
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,279
pick up on what the corporate and the

856
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,720
entrepreneur were saying here, when we

857
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,640
look at the places around the planet

858
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,720
that have strong innovation ecosystems

859
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,279
and good innovation leads to strong

860
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,679
economies which leads to good social and

861
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,360
health and environmental outcomes, it's

862
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,600
often when these different stakeholders

863
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,120
find a way to talk to each other despite

864
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,120
the different timelines. I love the

865
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,360
example of the corporate NDA and the

866
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,080
startup has already IPOed you know just

867
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,000
on completely different clock speeds. Uh

868
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,159
talking of which there is the pigeon is

869
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,320
it pigeon app in which you can put

870
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,760
question and so this is going to be

871
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,600
cropping up so please put in your

872
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,120
questions and then you get to upvote

873
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,799
them and apparently the people in the

874
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,720
booth will give us those questions so we

875
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,240
can see what's out there but will lead

876
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,320
turning to you now on the risk side

877
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,799
you're obviously you like to invest in

878
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,720
risk where there's going to be reward um

879
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,919
do you see many examples of companies

880
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,840
that are coming through that have found

881
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,000
a way to fund themselves through

882
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,440
corporate engagements is that ever of

883
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,480
interest to you on the risk capital

884
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,159
providing side

885
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,279
>> actually we did uh one of our best

886
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,960
investment came out of Sainsbury I mean

887
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,480
you see some of the stuff happening

888
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,039
where Sainsbury try to make an

889
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,679
investment to solve an internal problem

890
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,600
I mean if you as I'm listening to the

891
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,440
panel it raises the interesting question

892
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,919
about what's driving that behavior why

893
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,080
do we see a lack of risk appetite what

894
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,360
is the and you've got to go back to as

895
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,159
we were talking about it with Michael

896
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,080
earlier on it's human behavior right and

897
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,480
I would say you know it's either greed

898
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,880
or fear In the case of wear, I would

899
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,799
argue that they got to a point that fear

900
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,960
overcame and if they weren't going to do

901
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,960
something, they could see the downward

902
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,360
trend and therefore they were forced

903
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,039
into doing something. Engaging with a

904
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,200
startup is going to come within that

905
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,279
dynamic. Are we doing it because we h

906
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,760
are missing a big hole and we need to

907
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,360
basically plug it or it's great it's

908
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,919
going to help us grow. The problem the

909
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,080
UK is a bit you know like academia at

910
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,080
this stage you know lots of politics

911
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,320
because there's so little to fight for.

912
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,640
you know, it's the growth isn't there.

913
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,320
So, basically, people are just eating

914
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,240
off of each other. Uh, if you're doing

915
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,519
that and you're in a corporate and

916
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,360
you're saying, I'm going to make an

917
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,440
investment into a startup, partner with

918
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,720
an investment startup, what is my net

919
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,200
gain? If the growth isn't there, then to

920
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,360
be honest, the cost and the riskreward

921
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,960
doesn't really stack up, which is why a

922
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,200
lot of the problem. However, if I could

923
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,519
see that partnering with a startup is

924
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,320
going to give me significant advantage

925
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,399
over someone else and I can take market

926
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,519
share that becomes the greed you want to

927
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,279
play with. I don't see a lot of fear in

928
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,200
a lot of the corporates in terms of not

929
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,960
doing anything yet. I think that is

930
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,200
beginning to change with AI. They are

931
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,679
going to have to do certain things

932
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,279
>> uh as we pass through the hype cycle and

933
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,880
it becomes real. There's going to be new

934
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,559
adoption. The question is whether the

935
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,840
returns on that investments are going to

936
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,799
be high or it's just going to be

937
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,360
replacement of existing capex. On the

938
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,240
upside, as long as you don't have excess

939
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,559
economic growth, it's very hard to

940
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,919
justify a lot of that piling into

941
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,360
innovation because if you do,

942
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,279
so what versus you just generate cash.

943
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,279
So for us when we look at our companies

944
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,960
and we engage with them and we went

945
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:43,200
through a session a couple of days ago

946
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,640
where even if you drive the innovation

947
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,240
the answer from the companies to us

948
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,720
great we have a lot of innovation we can

949
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,880
think about our consu our customers will

950
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,640
just not pay us more they'll give us a

951
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,080
contract but they will not pay us more

952
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,240
for the value ad that I think is a major

953
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,320
issue in terms of the incentives of

954
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,399
people to make the choices to make that

955
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,399
choice to innovate to partner with

956
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,880
startups because it's got to be worth it

957
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,120
Mhm.

958
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,800
>> If there's not enough there to be taken,

959
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,119
why would it be worth it? And this is

960
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,040
something we struggled with all day.

961
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,440
>> Excellent. Thank you for that. And uh

962
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,399
you've pivot us pivoted us nicely to AI,

963
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,960
which I'm going to come through the

964
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,040
panel asking how AI is affecting your

965
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,480
world. But it just strikes me that as an

966
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,879
important message there both for the

967
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,320
corporates and the startups to have that

968
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,399
risk mentality of a risk capital um

969
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,760
provider thinking about, you know, what

970
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,240
risks can you take? But maybe I could

971
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,040
just ask you one meta question about the

972
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,280
UK. Wid, what do you think is holding us

973
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,159
back from achieving some of that growth

974
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,399
and productivity that we could um if if

975
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,839
we had any policy people here just a

976
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,200
quick remark about the thing they should

977
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,399
do and then we'll come through all three

978
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,000
of you.

979
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:53,440
>> AI 39% of the GDP goes to tax

980
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,599
>> compared 39% okay

981
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,880
>> compared to the US which is I think at

982
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,720
federal levels 25 with another maybe 4%

983
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,320
at states. So the differential just to

984
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,200
give you a number if you look at that

985
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,200
10% differential in taxation and map it

986
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,400
out to the US that's an extra $2.6

987
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,680
trillion that of free spend that the US

988
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,000
has to spend. Okay,

989
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,960
>> that's the whole size of the UK economy

990
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,040
just on the tax differential. Uh there's

991
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,200
a lot of it when you squeeze that much

992
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,119
of the companies like national

993
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,520
insurance. So I'm not basically ranting

994
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,320
about taxation but the national debt

995
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,240
level is so high right now everybody's

996
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,880
concerned. constraints on it. So these

997
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,359
are I think the macro factors here are

998
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,599
really impacting the mindset and the

999
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,320
innovation. The taxation levels are not

1000
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,480
leaving enough disposable income in

1001
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,960
people's hands to basically drive that

1002
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,359
consumer economy that you need. At the

1003
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,079
company level, you know, you're finally

1004
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:52,000
driving that human capital versus

1005
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,079
physical capital replacement because now

1006
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,400
it's too expensive to h to have people.

1007
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,560
So you have this low fire, low higher

1008
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,359
economy and people are going to have to

1009
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,240
start shifting to it. So I do think this

1010
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,960
the the financial situation of the UK

1011
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,960
economy is now becoming a real real

1012
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,560
stumbling block for actually growth.

1013
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,240
>> Okay. Well, thank you for that. And the

1014
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,680
reason I've come over here is not to be

1015
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,119
weird, but I just realized but they put

1016
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,119
the questions on either side and I can't

1017
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,760
see them standing at the front. Um so

1018
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:23,040
from your lips to any ears in number 11

1019
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,720
Downing Street. Um but now AI will you

1020
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,560
like to say something on AI or should we

1021
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,800
have one of the other two how is AI

1022
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,440
changing your world?

1023
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,960
um early days, isn't it? I think yeah

1024
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,800
and we've got to be really careful

1025
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,160
around this. So there's a

1026
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,520
>> we've had number of startups come

1027
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,760
through looking at AI um and the sectors

1028
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,160
perhaps that they've been looking at um

1029
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,079
back to risk again maybe looking at our

1030
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,680
government organizations in terms of

1031
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,680
adoption.

1032
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,480
uh maybe maybe there's concern there

1033
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,280
obviously there's there's data there's u

1034
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,040
ethics issues to tackle as well and

1035
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,839
maybe what we have is uh from an

1036
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,000
entrepreneurial perspective um companies

1037
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,400
wanting to push companies wanted to to

1038
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,480
get ahead but maybe there's from a

1039
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,640
corporate government perspective it's

1040
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,320
more of a cautious approach and rightly

1041
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,920
so so there's there's a need I guess

1042
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,839
that we see in MSPAC if you look at

1043
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,359
those state stakeholders we need to get

1044
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,760
the skills right we need to think about

1045
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,599
the ethical issues the data issues

1046
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,760
But we've also got this massive push

1047
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,200
from the startups who really want to get

1048
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,480
ahead and push their

1049
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,680
balance there somewhere.

1050
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,200
>> Yeah. Well, thank goodness for those

1051
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,520
startups being at the cutting edge

1052
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,720
trying these tools out in the world of

1053
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,320
corporate and then I'll probably go to

1054
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,119
the top question as it's got seven

1055
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,520
votes. Uh Alan, so in the world of the

1056
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,400
corporates, AI mining, how's it looking

1057
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,240
to you? Yeah, I think AI right now is

1058
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,520
it's a little bit of it's everywhere as

1059
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,680
and it's talked about everywhere and I

1060
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,240
think the hype cycle is a good way to

1061
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,320
good place for it right now. If I look

1062
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,920
at it in our application of AI without

1063
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,839
looking at I'll name a couple of

1064
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,000
specifics I'm personally excited about

1065
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,200
is it's an efficiency tool. It's people

1066
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,200
coming back from holiday and running

1067
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,680
co-pilot over their inbox to work out

1068
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,760
what emails they need to get. It's my

1069
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,520
daughter putting filters on photographs

1070
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,599
of herself and consuming gigawatts of

1071
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,320
energy to do so through data centers.

1072
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,599
So, so I think

1073
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,000
>> must be a proud father.

1074
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,880
>> So, I didn't say she was 21, did I? No,

1075
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,119
she's not. She's 14. Um, but I think

1076
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,040
it's got to find the application. It's

1077
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,960
for us in engineering and corporate,

1078
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,400
it's going to be a tool. Where I'm more

1079
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,560
excited about it is things the work we

1080
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,839
are doing around our generative AI. It's

1081
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,839
we're looking at how do we design

1082
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,920
products using generative AI. How do we

1083
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,839
stop designing straight lines, curves,

1084
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,440
and holes and start looking at how

1085
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,280
products can meet fit, form, and

1086
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,040
function if the human brain isn't

1087
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,200
constraining it? So I think that's quite

1088
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,680
exciting from an engineering perspective

1089
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,960
but we've got a long way to go said

1090
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,839
about you know where does it sit

1091
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,280
ethically morally um it opens up more

1092
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,880
questions than answers right now but

1093
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,480
it's not going to go away so it's we

1094
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,640
have to look at how we're going to apply

1095
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,480
it how we're going to govern it and how

1096
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,119
we drive value and I don't mean value

1097
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,920
specifically from an ROI it can't the

1098
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,520
end state can't be humans need not apply

1099
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,400
it's got to be a tool that helps the the

1100
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,920
the the advancement of from a we

1101
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,839
perspective our products our value

1102
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,320
offering to customer. It's got to make

1103
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,440
the way we meet the requirements uh of

1104
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,359
our customers and the resource

1105
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,440
requirements of the world to decarbonize

1106
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,520
have got to be accelerated and aided by

1107
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,280
but it's got to be done. Um it's got to

1108
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,119
be a partnership for me, but I'm I'm not

1109
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,200
quite sure how we get there yet.

1110
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,200
>> Okay, excellent. I'm going to take the

1111
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,240
top question and I'll see which one of

1112
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,839
you would like to reply. Um I'm here on

1113
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,240
standing in for Fiona Murray who's going

1114
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,920
to join us by video later today. And one

1115
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,240
of the things that she has done as a

1116
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,160
professor of entrepreneurship is study

1117
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,400
the inequities that seem to have come

1118
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,839
about within the world um and

1119
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,079
particularly a lot of the entrepreneurs

1120
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,079
as we see at MIT the 50% of the

1121
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,640
undergraduate student body is that is

1122
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,800
female is no less entrepreneurial and

1123
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,839
yet there's something about the pipeline

1124
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,599
not so many of them go on to PhDs not so

1125
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,520
many of them get onto patents Fiona

1126
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,040
studied venture capitalists one of the

1127
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,680
reasons we don't encourage you to be

1128
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,280
Silicon Valley venture capitalist

1129
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,920
boys because they are pretty much all

1130
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,560
boys is with a great uncertainty they

1131
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,040
tend to fund other boys and so thinking

1132
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,040
through how do we uh tackle this

1133
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,640
pipeline issues and deal with the the

1134
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,400
entre uh the entrepreneurs who are

1135
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,240
female. Oh look they put it up as a big

1136
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,760
question so this we'll no doubt be

1137
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,839
coming back to this several times uh

1138
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,599
during the day but who would like to

1139
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:27,760
talk about female entrepreneurs and what

1140
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,920
we can do to increase the diversity

1141
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,000
within the sector. I'll pick for I'll be

1142
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,320
trouble if I don't because I've with

1143
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,240
three uh fellow colleagues and I'm aware

1144
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,320
of the diversity on the panel as well

1145
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,480
today. Um so I was pleased to see the

1146
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,800
previous panel as well but yeah we got

1147
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,640
>> three white men on the stage. Uh so it's

1148
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,920
it's not great on the panel but uh

1149
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,280
>> we've tried to balance it over the

1150
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,760
course of the day. So I imagine I'm

1151
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,599
Fiona.

1152
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,440
>> No absolutely

1153
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,280
>> but what can we do about it and and what

1154
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,520
does it look like at Mana Science Park I

1155
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,599
guess is the question. U we've been

1156
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,760
looking at this quite hard over the the

1157
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,319
recent years. we've been open. We've had

1158
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,400
a gender pay gap of around 16% on on the

1159
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,599
site and I'm pleased to report that

1160
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,240
we've closed it. It's down to 43 pounds.

1161
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,880
Uh so we are uh we are uh the pay gap

1162
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,720
has reduced. Um it's it's taken time and

1163
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,960
what we've seen as a trend over the

1164
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,800
years. It has closed and it's it's got

1165
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,119
to the right place now. But what can we

1166
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,359
do proactively? I guess uh some of the

1167
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,160
things we do is in outreach work. We do

1168
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,920
go into uh schools. We deliver STEM

1169
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,920
training and so forth and we take role

1170
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,599
models with us into those sessions and

1171
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,960
role models have been has been proven to

1172
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,560
be one of the most effective ways of

1173
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,800
inspiring next.

1174
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,839
>> So um and those role models by the way

1175
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,599
are not just STEM engineers um but

1176
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,640
business people entrepreneurs as well.

1177
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,640
So we need to plant those

1178
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,560
entrepreneurial seeds not just for the

1179
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,319
boys but for the girls as well and I

1180
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,480
think role models are crucial for that.

1181
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,480
>> Great very well put. Did somebody else

1182
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,119
want to come in on that one? I mean I

1183
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,040
think on our side again our organization

1184
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,119
doesn't have a huge amount of diversity.

1185
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,960
Uh it's something we're working on and

1186
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,720
we see it I mean we do back female

1187
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,560
entrepreneurs. We don't see enough of

1188
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,079
them at our stage. These are well

1189
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,200
established businesses. So they've been

1190
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,359
around for 10 years. They're grown etc.

1191
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Uh but we don't see enough of them

1192
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:15,119
coming our way. What we see is again

1193
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,920
typically male-dominated companies

1194
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:21,200
coming through typically same color and

1195
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,119
typically very much like what you see in

1196
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,520
typical UK corporates. So that's the

1197
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,240
environment we operate into. Do we think

1198
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,560
we're missing something? 100%. Uh it

1199
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,680
it's you do get into the group think

1200
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,680
single model uh approach to things and

1201
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,760
that's not a healthy place to be. It was

1202
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,520
like also said you put a bunch of white

1203
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,440
guys in a room nothing good comes out of

1204
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,240
it.

1205
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,520
words to live by.

1206
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,880
>> Alan, did you want to weigh in on this

1207
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,440
one or the next one?

1208
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,599
>> I think only one thing to add and if I

1209
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,920
take STEM and engineering as a proxy for

1210
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,560
entrepreneurship, it actually from my

1211
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,880
opinion, it starts at school. I think it

1212
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,440
goes right back to to primary school.

1213
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,920
Um, you know, primary engineering is a

1214
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,079
great uh a great institution to just

1215
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,599
encourage that inclusion and diversity.

1216
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,200
Unfortunately, I think if we look at the

1217
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,040
makeup of the panel, some some of it's

1218
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,560
just got to it's got to be grandfathered

1219
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,319
out. You know, the changes have to start

1220
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,960
at at ground level. We've all got a part

1221
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:19,520
to play, but I think it'll only ever be

1222
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,880
truly achieved when it's my daughter's

1223
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,880
generation and the generation come

1224
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,400
through who have have never had the same

1225
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,880
constraints and never had the sort of

1226
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,400
same um sort of bifurcation triation.

1227
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,680
Oh, you're a boy, you that this is a

1228
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,680
better career for you, that you're a

1229
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,599
girl is a better career for you. We just

1230
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,960
need to eradicate all of that and and

1231
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,680
for me it starts primary school,

1232
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,880
secondary school, secondary education.

1233
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,480
>> Thank you for saying that. We're going

1234
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,160
to turn to the next question which has

1235
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,640
has nine votes. But just one point if

1236
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,560
Fiona were here uh I I think she would

1237
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,160
say there's definitely sort of the

1238
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,160
long-term change that needs to come

1239
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,400
through through the pipeline and we have

1240
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,240
responsibilities as leaders through that

1241
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,200
pipeline but there are also things that

1242
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,520
you can choose to do after today as

1243
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,280
Praderi was saying the role models

1244
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,520
really matter matter. Fiona's got some

1245
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,520
great social science. When you send out

1246
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,040
to the MIT boys, you know, come be an

1247
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,520
entrepreneur, they don't care whether

1248
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,800
it's male or female. If you send out the

1249
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,960
female CEO of some amazing MIT startups,

1250
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,359
it sends the message. So, there are

1251
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,640
little things you can go to do. And I

1252
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,079
think it's not only the right thing to

1253
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,800
do, but to the extent that we've got a

1254
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:27,599
competitiveness uh productivity problem

1255
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,920
to be holding back the talented half of

1256
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,680
our society that is female is not good

1257
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,079
for our competitive advantage either as

1258
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,720
a nation uh or as individual for-p

1259
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,800
profofit companies. Turning to those

1260
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,359
government funding and the life cycle of

1261
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,119
existence, um what do you think's wrong

1262
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:44,319
about the escape velocity? I know

1263
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,720
there's lots of government money

1264
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:49,280
provided in the UK, UK research,

1265
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,599
innovation, innovate UK. Maybe that's

1266
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,520
where the taxes are going. I don't know.

1267
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,680
Um, who would like to speak to that

1268
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,000
question? Perhaps Predi.

1269
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,400
>> Go on, why not? Um, there's a place for

1270
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,319
it, isn't there? Um, especially maybe

1271
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:07,040
seeding some of the early high-risk um

1272
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,200
projects or or startups or ideas. And

1273
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,880
maybe there's an opportunity as well

1274
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,880
thinking about the corporates risk

1275
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,319
appetite. Maybe there's there's

1276
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,560
partnerships that we're not getting

1277
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,480
right in into these sort of funding

1278
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,400
streets and you think about government

1279
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,040
corporate partnerships. They're few and

1280
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,720
far between uh in this space. So maybe

1281
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,560
there's a real opportunity there. But I

1282
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:30,480
think there is role for government

1283
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:33,440
funding uh in in terms of this um life

1284
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,599
cycle. But we do need to move away from

1285
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,440
that grand culture and we do need to

1286
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:41,040
move towards uh well markets problems

1287
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,839
solutions that and if there's a market

1288
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,560
for it should turn to to kind of risk

1289
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:47,760
capital then um so um seeding the ideas

1290
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,280
there's something else as well from a

1291
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,599
Welsh perspective that we need to see

1292
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,520
more of this innovation funding um

1293
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,920
coming into Wales. So that's one of our

1294
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:58,319
objectives. So it does tend to get get

1295
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,200
spent in the golden triangle. So, are

1296
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:03,920
big advocates of of seeing uh all that

1297
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,760
money or part of that money being spent

1298
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,760
in in Wales and it's really frustrating

1299
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,000
for our startup community by the way to

1300
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,520
go through the hoops to apply for these

1301
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,160
funding that you're in highly

1302
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,839
competitive rounds to get a knock back

1303
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,599
and you get another knock back. Yeah.

1304
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,680
>> And by the third one, do you know what?

1305
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,599
I'm just going to carry on with my thing

1306
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,200
over here. So, um there's resilience

1307
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,960
there for them as well and it gets

1308
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,520
difficult. So I think the funders need

1309
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,800
to be mindful of that and uh look to to

1310
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,800
level up perhaps sure

1311
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,440
>> on the R&D funding.

1312
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,480
>> Can on that point

1313
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,000
>> you want to come in on that? Yeah, that

1314
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,640
one that one bothers me because

1315
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,920
effectively if you look at the US

1316
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,079
economy, if it wasn't for NIH money at

1317
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,560
what 25 billion a year, 30 billion a

1318
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:46,560
year, DARPA,

1319
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,119
AE, whatever version of it, you want to

1320
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,760
get the various SBIC funds that are

1321
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,200
there. I would argue that you're seeing

1322
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,640
plus the subsidies that go to tech

1323
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,800
company. I would say that you're seeing

1324
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,960
in the US probably and you guys have

1325
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,440
better estimates Phil of 100 billion to

1326
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,280
150 billion of actually ignore the

1327
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,440
universities MIT guess what two billion

1328
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,880
a year from the government for uh

1329
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,400
research the amount

1330
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,599
>> chancellor's nodding to the numbers that

1331
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,319
sounds good

1332
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,359
>> so you have the amount of money that is

1333
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:18,400
put into very basic research into the US

1334
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:20,560
by the government is very high argument

1335
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,000
in the UK is not that we shouldn't be

1336
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,520
doing government funding that we're not

1337
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,760
thinking big enough about government

1338
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:29,920
funding into early stage deep science

1339
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,760
that is speculative i.e. ARPA DARPA this

1340
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,040
is really what's going to create an

1341
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,200
ecosystem that's going to fund

1342
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,359
universities national labs for example

1343
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,280
we have a few on the science side the

1344
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,560
nuclear we need more because you're

1345
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,400
never going to develop the nuclear

1346
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,000
ecosystem here without it that

1347
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,640
collaboration as you said between

1348
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,359
government corporates and with risk

1349
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:52,319
capital it's got unfortunately it's got

1350
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:54,640
to start with very directed funding by

1351
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,400
the government to take those risks that

1352
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,720
are going to create the things like the

1353
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,040
Francis Kirk institute like the

1354
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,040
innovations you found in Oxford. I just

1355
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,359
think the UK is big thinking big enough

1356
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,920
about this thing and we don't have the

1357
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:10,880
willingness to actually see a failure of

1358
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,440
a setup. You want to see 50% failure.

1359
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,640
You want to see 75% failure because the

1360
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,040
25% that remain will be amazing but we

1361
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,160
just can't see that appetite here.

1362
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,440
>> That's really interesting. Did you want

1363
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,119
to come in on that Andrew?

1364
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,079
>> I just going to add one thing. So, so we

1365
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:29,119
work with on lower TRL research through

1366
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:31,359
government funded projects and and well

1367
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,800
it's a bit awkward and slow at the front

1368
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,880
end. We get there in the end. I think

1369
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,240
the consortia works well. I think where

1370
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,800
I struggle a little bit is with some of

1371
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,040
the catapult centers in the UK where

1372
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,319
they almost seem to be competing against

1373
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,400
each other. So I think we're probably

1374
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,920
being inefficient with the capital that

1375
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,440
the government put in because they're

1376
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,599
almost run like standard standalone

1377
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,160
business units. So if we talk to AMRL

1378
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,520
and we talk to the National Composite

1379
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,680
Center, both will claim to have

1380
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:57,920
expertise in XYZ and you think, "No, no,

1381
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,200
I want to work for the best of our

1382
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,960
company and the best of industry with

1383
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,800
with the best that's out there. So take

1384
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,400
that out there, put it there and make

1385
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,839
that center of excellence." And I don't

1386
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,000
know if that's the way they're they're

1387
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:09,599
managed internally, how their local KPIs

1388
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,440
run, etc., and how people are rewarded,

1389
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,760
but but it seems a little bit

1390
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,720
counterintuitive and it we're actually

1391
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,119
planning in inefficiencies for us as the

1392
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,480
um as the consumer.

1393
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,000
>> No, that's a really good point and I'm

1394
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,280
glad to hear that there is a role for

1395
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,880
government but one of the things we've

1396
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,480
seen over the years with the US it's

1397
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,640
sort of adjusted the ways that it makes

1398
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,160
the money available and I'm at an event

1399
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:32,000
tonight with Britain's ARPA which is

1400
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,160
called ARA. So there's definitely trying

1401
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,599
to learn how do we do that public money.

1402
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,800
I was going to turn to the theme

1403
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,720
question and then as given we've got

1404
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,319
about five minutes left do that question

1405
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,359
and then after that come through with

1406
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:45,760
closing remarks calls to action. Um but

1407
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:48,240
it says here around 99% of UK businesses

1408
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,520
are small and medium-siz enterprises

1409
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,520
they are different from some of the

1410
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,559
entrepreneurial startups that Praderei

1411
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,800
has. Um, and do we see a role for for

1412
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,680
them between the startups of Predereari

1413
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:02,480
and the large corporates of of Andrews

1414
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,880
we're we're world um is there a role for

1415
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,119
formemes who would like to speak onto

1416
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,319
that 99% of the economy?

1417
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,559
>> I think there's definitely a role

1418
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:13,280
formemes. Uh there's there's innovation

1419
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,079
there that can tackle real problems. Um

1420
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,240
how do we overcome that? I think when it

1421
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,000
comes to uh innovation funding needs to

1422
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,680
reflect that, doesn't it? And and I

1423
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
don't I can't see that at the moment.

1424
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:27,200
the the innovation calls coming out. You

1425
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,599
don't get an extra 10 m points for being

1426
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,119
a microme applying in partnership with a

1427
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:35,440
with a corporate but it would be quite a

1428
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:37,599
refreshing approach to see to see uh in

1429
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,839
innovation for me like to see that.

1430
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,480
>> I would say there's lots of very a large

1431
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:45,119
number of very averagememes out there.

1432
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,119
>> Do they deserve additional funding? I

1433
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,520
would say arguably not because many of

1434
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,599
them when we see them coming through

1435
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,480
they're interesting but are they

1436
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:56,559
fundamentally showing you know thought

1437
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,160
processes about gaining market share

1438
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,160
innovation I don't care for innovation

1439
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,680
for the sake of it it's got to be is it

1440
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,200
improving your revenue line is it

1441
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,119
improving your gross margin or is it

1442
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,800
improving your operating margin

1443
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:08,720
>> it's got to do one of the three if you

1444
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,119
can't put a story that says this is what

1445
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:12,880
we're doing giving me the framework of

1446
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,800
why you're going to win

1447
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,559
>> why would I give you capital and that

1448
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,880
what that is what's missing part of the

1449
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,200
innovation is there's a missing skill

1450
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,040
set in the ability to do that in the UK

1451
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,119
middle market because naturally these

1452
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,720
companies are smaller than what you'd

1453
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,119
find. I mean keep in mind UK middle

1454
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:32,079
market is sort of 5 million to maybe 15

1455
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:34,400
million in the US that's lower middle

1456
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,400
market. It doesn't qualify for them 25

1457
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,000
to 50 million is sort of where middle

1458
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,559
market starts. So the skill sets

1459
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,920
available are higher and it also shows

1460
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,920
in the way they're able to raise

1461
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,599
capital. I think that's in large part

1462
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,280
what these companies are missing is that

1463
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,359
skill set to help them propel to the

1464
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,760
next level. But then again, in an

1465
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,960
economy that's fairly well constrained,

1466
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,160
you're going to have to be taking it

1467
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,160
from somebody else.

1468
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,079
>> So the question is who's winning, who's

1469
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,920
losing?

1470
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,599
>> All I would add is exactly that. Yeah.

1471
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,599
Yes, there is. But what problem are you

1472
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,760
trying to solve?

1473
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,920
>> That's true. Yeah. Given that resources

1474
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,760
are constrained. Thank you. So, as we're

1475
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,280
heading into the last few minutes, um

1476
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,160
I'll make a few remarks and then I'll

1477
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,760
turn to Praderi first for his call to

1478
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,359
action and what you think needs to be

1479
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,920
approved and then we'll go through and

1480
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:23,280
then no doubt some refreshing bracing

1481
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,119
advice from W on what we need to do. Um,

1482
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,119
one thing we would say onmemes when we

1483
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:29,200
do our reap program around the world, we

1484
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,240
are as MIT especially interested in the

1485
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:34,720
high-end tech entrepreneurs of of Pred's

1486
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,480
world that get the kind of fancy risk

1487
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,559
capital funding that really can be

1488
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,640
rocket fuel, the kind that Wed is

1489
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,480
talking about that can do the kinds of

1490
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,480
risks that aren't always easy for a

1491
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,079
large corporate like we and so we're

1492
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,000
pleased to hear that they're engaging.

1493
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:50,480
But we do also say it's really important

1494
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,800
that themes find a way to innovate. They

1495
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,440
may not be the big eye innovation 10x

1496
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,839
transformational disruptive but given

1497
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,520
that they are in most countries 80 to

1498
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:03,040
95% of the economy we wantmemes to be a

1499
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,400
little bit more innovative even if it's

1500
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,040
little I you know without government

1501
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,680
funding and and risk capital but just

1502
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,559
leaders ofmemes be a bit more innovative

1503
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,720
because they do employ so many people uh

1504
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:17,599
on mass you know if we could get them to

1505
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,599
adopt in some of their cases e-commerce

1506
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,640
let alone generative AI you know if they

1507
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,319
could just become a little bit more

1508
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,480
digitally savvy. It's not glamorous.

1509
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:25,760
It's the hards yards of economic

1510
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,839
productivity, but we think there's a

1511
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,400
role for them and I know BT does a lot

1512
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:32,800
to help small businesses. So, as we

1513
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,119
prepare to wrap up, Praderi, final

1514
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,079
thoughts, call for action, the voice of

1515
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,640
the entrepreneur.

1516
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:41,119
>> I guess the final thoughts is and call

1517
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,599
to action is engage with your innovation

1518
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,240
ecosystems. Uh they do exist all over

1519
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:50,079
the UK, all over the world. Um they're

1520
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:52,079
there easily accessible. Um so

1521
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:54,319
develop a relationship with them and

1522
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,640
develop that culture of can do

1523
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:59,040
partnerships and across the model as

1524
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,680
well. So from government to risk

1525
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:04,400
capital, corporate, startups all working

1526
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,000
together. So yeah engage. Good. I just

1527
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,440
like to underpin that we are the London

1528
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,760
Symposium but we know from our work in

1529
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,839
the UK there are innovation ecosystems.

1530
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,000
There are pockets of great startups all

1531
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:17,040
of them there. Not all is as as

1532
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,640
well-dressed as Praderei here, but

1533
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,920
please do come and chat with him about

1534
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,000
ways if you're a corporate that you

1535
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,800
could find ways uh to work with his

1536
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,920
amazing uh entrepreneurs.

1537
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:30,079
>> Where Yeah, I think it's similar. It's

1538
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,880
but with a but it's engage but

1539
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:35,119
understand what your limitations are in

1540
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,559
the way you engage and be prepared to

1541
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,720
change. I think that's what we are

1542
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,880
trying to do is make sure that we have

1543
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:42,319
the ability to engage and not frustrate

1544
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,319
the entrepreneur.

1545
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:46,240
a ecosystem

1546
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:47,920
um and and it's not all about the hard

1547
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,839
ROI. We're doing it to advance and

1548
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,480
accelerate technology into our existing

1549
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:54,640
product to address um challenges that

1550
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,920
the industry is facing. I think if we

1551
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:59,280
took a hard ROI, we would possibly

1552
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,960
invest in the same number of startups,

1553
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,480
but we would have a different outcome.

1554
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,400
It would be cash and not and not

1555
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,319
product, which right now isn't right for

1556
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,520
us. So engage, but understand why you're

1557
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:09,760
engaging.

1558
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,240
>> No, thank you, Alan. wid

1559
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,400
>> I think for us it's much more about

1560
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,880
getting our working with our CEOs to

1561
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,040
help them actually be willing to take

1562
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,280
those risks help them think through

1563
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,280
provide that thought leadership about

1564
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,720
how do you basic how do you actually

1565
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,480
look at the future in the different way

1566
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,280
what can you adapt I mean we're partners

1567
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,720
with the MIT ILP so I think we're one of

1568
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,119
the few financial if not the only

1569
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,960
financial partner they have with the

1570
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,880
idea done so we haven't really done it

1571
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,559
very well to be very honest about it it

1572
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,680
hasn't worked very well trying to get

1573
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:43,920
our portfolios to engage with the ILP

1574
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,839
and that to us is the biggest next thing

1575
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,599
try to get our companies to see that

1576
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,839
there's much more out there that they

1577
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:52,079
don't have to fundamentally break

1578
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:54,160
everything in the company to rebuild it

1579
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,920
but those marginal improvements in terms

1580
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,920
of workflows and just giving them

1581
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,680
conceptually new ways to think about the

1582
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,920
issues they're dealing with I think

1583
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,680
that'll have a major impact and that I

1584
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,839
think is a lot what's missing the theme

1585
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,400
they don't have a conceptual framework

1586
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:10,480
to say how do I go forward what's

1587
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,520
possible out there if I mix these things

1588
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,200
together, how do what's the better

1589
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,119
outcome that I can generate? And that to

1590
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,480
us is probably the biggest focus for the

1591
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,079
next couple years.

1592
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,760
>> Excellent. Well, thank you for that.

1593
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:24,240
With that, I'm going to start to pull

1594
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,040
the panel together and close. You now

1595
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:29,280
have earned yourself a coffee break uh

1596
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:31,760
until quarter past. So, I encourage you

1597
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,200
to heed their calls to action. Maybe

1598
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,880
there's one of these three that you want

1599
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,040
to come up and chat with. If you've not

1600
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,040
met a real life entrepreneur, do come up

1601
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:41,040
and chat with Praderei. If you are in a

1602
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,000
large company that wonders how on earth

1603
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,280
Allan and where did that cultural change

1604
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,880
uh or if you're interested in hearing

1605
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,960
more about the hard-headed approach of

1606
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,880
these high-risisk highreward uh

1607
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,880
hopefully W also stick around for a

1608
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,400
while. So, uh the break is now until

1609
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,599
quarter past, but please join me in a

1610
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,599
round of applause for our amazing

1611
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,599
panelists.
