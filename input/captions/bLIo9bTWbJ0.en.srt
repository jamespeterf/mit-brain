00:00:02,647 --> 00:00:05,220
(text crackles)

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,280
- Hello, everyone, and
welcome to another episode

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,230
of CSAIL Office Hours

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,160
where we dive into the brilliant
minds of the innovators

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,910
who are driving the future
of computing at CSAIL.

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,180
My name is Daniela Rus and
I'm the director of CSAIL.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,530
Today we have a very special
guest, professor Tom Leighton.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,330
Tom is distinguished MIT
professor, beloved member of CSAIL,

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,140
and co-founder and CEO
of Akamai Technologies,

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,800
the world's leading content
delivery network provider.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,740
Tom's research on network algorithms

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,410
has laid the foundations of his company

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,050
and made a huge difference in how

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,480
you receive your information today,

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,310
so, let's dive into Tom's
research journey at CSAIL.

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,830
Tom, it's so great to have you here.

18
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,370
Your work and your impact
is so inspirational

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,160
and it's legendary for us at CSAIL,

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,300
and it goes back to the 1990s
when you were a professor

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,610
and you had some brilliant ideas

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,250
that ended up having huge impact.

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,700
Can you walk us through what
it was like in the 1990s

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,420
at CSAIL when you were
such a big innovator

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,540
in the field of networked algorithms?

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,390
- Really an exciting time at, then,

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,740
the Lab for Computer Science.

28
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,510
CCL didn't exist yet.

29
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,380
In fact, I remember
actually first coming to MIT

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,187
as a grad student, that
goes back to the late 70s,

31
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:40,187
and then, the work being
done in cryptography

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,750
was gonna change the world.

33
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,160
My first advisor, Len Adelman,
and Adi Shamir was visiting,

34
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,260
and Ron Rivest ran the theory group.

35
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,560
Then of course, you get to
the 80s, Goldwasser-Micali.

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,140
It's amazing what was happening

37
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,910
in the Lab for Computer Science.

38
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,310
It was really the who's who

39
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,160
of theoretical computer scientists,

40
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,080
people working on algorithms.

41
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,630
- A walk among touring award winners.

42
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,200
- Yeah, now you go fast
forward, big prize winners,

43
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,200
and of course, it changed
everything on the field.

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,270
And then you go to the 90s,

45
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,660
and my group was working on algorithms

46
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,910
for large-scale networks theory, right?

47
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,030
Improving theorems, and
how would you route packets

48
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,910
and store information so that

49
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,919
you could do it really efficiently.

50
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,820
All mathematics, and Mike Dertouzos really

51
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,293
was very instrumental.

52
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,910
Sure, we had really great
people with great collaboration,

53
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,350
a fabulous environment,

54
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,540
and recruited Tim Berners-Lee

55
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,160
to be head of the Web Consortium

56
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,233
and his office was down the hall,

57
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,180
so his group and my group,
the algorithms folks,

58
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,350
got together and talking,

59
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,630
and that ultimately led
to a lot of the stuff

60
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,130
that led to Akamai,

61
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,960
but just a fabulous, innovative,

62
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,880
cross-disciplinary environment

63
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,830
in the Lab of Computer Science.

64
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,370
- People often ask me, what
is the secret sauce at CSAIL

65
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,350
and at MIT, so what was
it like about those times?

66
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,320
Computer science was
still a very young field.

67
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,610
The visionaries and the
innovators were all at MIT,

68
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,190
were known for the wild and crazy ideas

69
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,160
and were known for cooking them up

70
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,600
in the middle of the night.

71
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,860
What was it like?

72
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,400
- I remember we would, before
the conference deadlines,

73
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,130
we'd be up all night, maybe
(giggles) two nights in a row,

74
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,820
getting the papers in just in
time, and yeah, a lot of wild

75
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,820
and crazy ideas, a lot of
excitement, great collaboration,

76
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,920
engaging with students, faculty, postdocs,

77
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,740
and, you don't think about it at the time,

78
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,090
but a lot of those wild ideas
were gonna change the world,

79
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,820
and then you see it, now
you fast forward to today

80
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,020
and it's like, oh my goodness.

81
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,900
The things that happened here back then

82
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,540
that just at the time were
just a lot of fun, you know?

83
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,190
Doing cool research.

84
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,950
- Tell us a little bit about
the research you were doing

85
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,670
at that time, especially
about some of the insights

86
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,500
and technical ideas that
ultimately led to this huge impact

87
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,620
of computation on communication networks.

88
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,330
- It was all theoretical,

89
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,550
and that meant we weren't constrained

90
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,710
by any practical realities.

91
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,340
The ideas we were thinking
about the conventional wisdom

92
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,960
would be where you could never do

93
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,270
anything like that in practice.

94
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,240
You think about routing
packets in the internet,

95
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,330
well you, you just used
BGP like everyone else,

96
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,240
but in our case, well
you could do it faster,

97
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,100
at least mathematically,
in proven theorem,

98
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,770
if you sent the packet over
here and then to there,

99
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,960
and even though it looks
like that's longer,

100
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,510
turned out to be a lot
better for congestion

101
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,400
and make the whole thing work better.

102
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,190
You think back then and with websites,

103
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,520
they were in one place, and
maybe you had a mirror site,

104
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,710
and that's just the way it was done.

105
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,640
Of course, pretty quickly, it
was realized that's a problem,

106
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,400
and Tim Berners-Lee, he knew
that was gonna be a problem

107
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,840
way back in the mid 90s

108
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,217
and that's when he
approached our group saying,

109
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:10,740
"there's gotta be a better way here

110
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,260
because you get popular content

111
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,960
and there'll be a lot of
traffic to the website,

112
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,910
it's gonna crash", and it did,

113
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,540
and back then, dub dub dub
stood for world wide wave,

114
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,310
in the early days.

115
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,620
I remember even things like DNS,

116
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,560
back then, the protocol standard was

117
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,920
you gave one resolution for a name.

118
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,600
Now, it could be a few IP addresses.

119
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,020
It was limited by the size of
the packet to a small number.

120
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,170
In our case, we weren't
constrained by those realities,

121
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,320
so we said, "hey, when
you do the lookup for DNS,

122
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,960
you should refer it to a local server

123
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,650
and not have it be everybody
goes to the same place",

124
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,120
which broke protocol,

125
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,000
and people told us, "you can't do that."

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,370
Well, we were theoreticians,

127
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,980
so yeah, we can do it
because (laughs) it's math

128
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,960
and we've proven theorem,
and it works better,

129
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,000
and then in practice we implemented it

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,890
and yeah, it works a lot better.

131
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,320
- What do you see as the role of analysis

132
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,650
and understanding a
solution that you deploy

133
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,120
in the physical world?

134
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,570
Today, we deploy a lot of
solutions we do not understand,

135
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,080
which is quite different from taking

136
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,790
this more rigorous approach

137
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,070
and saying, we're gonna
solve this problem,

138
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,070
we're gonna understand its
scope and its limitations,

139
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,490
and then we're going to do
something with a solution.

140
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,300
- It makes a big difference
when you can prove theorems

141
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,630
and do a rigorous treatment
of how this algorithm,

142
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,620
this system is going to perform
under certain conditions,

143
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,140
and that made a big difference for us

144
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,340
when we actually implemented it,

145
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,350
which is a whole different
exercise (laughs)

146
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:48,450
to take theoretical algorithms

147
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,820
and code it up into a system,

148
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,730
but when you did do that,
you would have confidence

149
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,400
that it was really gonna work
in a variety of environments.

150
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,810
It would really be fault
tolerant, it would really be fast,

151
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,150
and that makes a world of difference,

152
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,710
'cause often, if you don't have that

153
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,870
and you build a system, you find out, ah,

154
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,880
there's all these things that blow it up,

155
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,100
or you try to make it twice as big

156
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,020
and it doesn't work anymore.

157
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,490
We didn't have that problem

158
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,010
because the theory really worked.

159
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,770
- When you solve a problem theoretically,

160
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,480
you make a set of assumptions

161
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,050
and then the solution is
subject to those assumptions.

162
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,640
Then when you take the solution

163
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,530
and you move it into the physical world,

164
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,350
you have to ask which of
those assumptions hold.

165
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,830
Did you find that all
your assumptions were okay

166
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,980
for the physical world or
did you have to innovate?

167
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,210
- Oh, there's a lot of innovation

168
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,176
and of course, when theory meets practice,

169
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:43,470
(laughs) that's not an easy thing.

170
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,080
- Yeah, there's always a big
step from theory to practice.

171
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,450
- Yeah, and of course, we
were all theoreticians,

172
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,180
didn't really know how
to code all that well.

173
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,070
We were fortunate that we hired

174
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,620
and worked with a lot of
people who were very good.

175
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,390
Way back in the day, Bonnie and I

176
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,550
coached the MIT programming team.

177
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,840
- Oh, that's awesome!

178
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,870
- Yeah, and so we (laughs)
actually had a good talent pool,

179
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,930
and they came to work in
the early days at Akamai,

180
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,600
but part of the theory that we developed

181
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,640
was to make it be fully distributed

182
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,370
and really fault tolerant on the basis

183
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,840
that a lot of things could break

184
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,330
and we had the theory say, okay,

185
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,730
the system will still stay up and work,

186
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,050
and that is critical,

187
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,120
'cause there weren't
single points of failure

188
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,360
because sure enough, a
lot of things did break,

189
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,250
but the system would still work.

190
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,540
- It's really extraordinary

191
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,390
because you were imagining a system

192
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,110
of scales much bigger than
what was possible at the time

193
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,780
with an application scope much bigger,

194
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,740
and I think the reason
everything came together so well

195
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,150
is because you had a kind of

196
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,520
an interdisciplinary approach, right?

197
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,180
You had the theory, you
had the system side,

198
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,120
and then you had the
World Wide Web Consortium

199
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,180
who presented the important challenge.

200
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,967
This is one of the secret ingredients

201
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:03,030
that I think remains very important

202
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,880
for how CSAIL advances computing.

203
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,060
There's this multidisciplinary
approach to computing

204
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,550
with people who are
passionate about different

205
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,110
sub areas of computing.

206
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,270
How important was that for your group?

207
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,860
How easy was it to set
these collaborations up?

208
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,970
- It was great.

209
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,610
That's the way CSAIL was, and it is.

210
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:27,150
I think the collaborations
are very powerful

211
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,950
and it made all the difference.

212
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,630
Without that, we wouldn't exist,

213
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,030
and a lot of advances wouldn't take place,

214
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,400
but the interdisciplinary research,

215
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,490
all the way from theory to real practice,

216
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,140
makes a huge difference.

217
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,390
- It's really extraordinary to think about

218
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,690
this kind of end-to-end comprehensively.

219
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,010
So, another thing that
MIT and CSAIL cares about

220
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,560
is real-world impact.

221
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,830
Is taking our results, our theories,

222
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,330
and algorithms, and ideas,

223
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,120
developed with a long time horizon

224
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,650
and making them relevant,

225
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,820
so how did you know that your algorithms

226
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,900
would be so relevant?

227
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,510
How did the story of Akamai start?

228
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,620
- We were naive, and being theoreticians,

229
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,320
just thought it should work in practice.

230
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,640
In terms of becoming a company,

231
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,640
that wasn't our goal, initially anyway,

232
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,090
but we entered the 50K contest,

233
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:27,060
mostly to learn about how do
you write a business plan,

234
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,557
and literally (laughs) got
books out of the library,

235
00:10:29,557 --> 00:10:31,890
"Business Plans for Dummies", you know?

236
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,080
And we learned a lot in the 50K.

237
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,000
We met venture capitalists.

238
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,640
None of us knew what a
venture capitalist was, even.

239
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,460
It's hard to believe
now, but that's the case.

240
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,140
We met with industry experts
and got a lot of advice.

241
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,040
Now, at the end of the
50K, we actually had offers

242
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,620
to start a company, but we decided not to.

243
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,872
- Did you win the 50K?

244
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:54,705
- No (giggles), we didn't.

245
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:57,390
It's sort of urban legend
is we did, but we didn't.

246
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,740
We made the final six, which
we were pretty excited about.

247
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,930
They only announced
first, second, and third.

248
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,950
We weren't announced.

249
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,010
I'm pretty sure we were last
among (giggles) the finalists,

250
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,830
just 'cause we had no business experience,

251
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,970
oh, and really saw much better
business plan presentations.

252
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,790
- But you had the tech
and you had the vision

253
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:22,790
and you had the impetus to
change the industry, right?

254
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,540
I mean, it was extraordinary.

255
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,610
- Yeah, we had good algorithms.

256
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,489
No code. We thought-
- Oh, no code?

257
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:30,630
- No code. No.

258
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,400
- When did you start implementing it?

259
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,900
- Our idea was to get other
people to use the technology,

260
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,900
so, during the 50K, we
went and talked to the ISPs

261
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,830
of the day, AOL, UUNET, (giggles)
HarvardNet here, locally,

262
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,400
and we wanted to get them
to use our algorithms,

263
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,230
which meant they would have to code it up

264
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,580
and make it all work,

265
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,980
and they talked to us
'cause we came from MIT

266
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,440
and it sounded interesting,

267
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,630
but then after they
heard what we were doing,

268
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,720
they said, "Ah, everybody
knows distributed computing

269
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,220
doesn't work in practice.

270
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,560
It's an ivory tower concept.

271
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,180
Thank you for coming, but please go back

272
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,860
to your ivory tower." (laughs)

273
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,720
So we totally struck out,

274
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,410
and then we actually decided
not to form a company

275
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,650
because we weren't sure
that we could actually

276
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,630
get the technology from theory

277
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,240
and algorithms to work in practice.

278
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Danny, co-founder, he wanted
to be a theory professor.

279
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,660
Would've been a great one.

280
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:34,650
I liked (giggles) being a
professor here. It's really fun.

281
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,750
But we kept on thinking about it,

282
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,840
and then started talking to the big names

283
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,790
in content delivery.

284
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,720
The websites that had a lot
of people coming to them,

285
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,960
and they said, "Look, if you build this,

286
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,440
we would buy it because we
need our websites to be faster.

287
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,810
It makes a big difference
to our business."

288
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,910
And so then, it got down to the point

289
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,300
where the only way we were
gonna get the technology out

290
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,520
in the real world is to do it ourselves,

291
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,540
and that meant forming a
company, writing (laughs) code,

292
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,970
and building the infrastructure.

293
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,460
- So, how did you decide
then to form the company?

294
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,150
- Well, we decided that
this is a very rare chance

295
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,860
for us to have a difference in practice.

296
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,430
I mean, theoreticians,
they do very cool stuff,

297
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:25,350
but most of what we do isn't
really useful in practice

298
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,970
and takes a long time if it is.

299
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,310
Now, the cryptographers
has done amazing things.

300
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,310
You look at public-key
cryptography and the work there,

301
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,160
but most of theory doesn't cross over,

302
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,140
and this was a rare opportunity,

303
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,150
and we did believe it would work,

304
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,430
so we decided, okay, we're
gonna bite the bullet

305
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,790
and step away from MIT,

306
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,100
which is (giggles) sort of our nest,

307
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,860
and we hired the former students,

308
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,930
the programming team members,

309
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,780
and went to the incubator space next door

310
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,650
and started the company.

311
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:59,820
Got funding from angels
at first and then the VCs,

312
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,070
and then we were on our way,

313
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,890
and sure enough, the theory did work

314
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,750
once we got it coded into algorithms.

315
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,220
- You had proofs, right?

316
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,750
- We did, yeah,
(Daniela laughs)

317
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,930
and then we took off pretty
quickly at that point.

318
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,850
- [Daniela] And so, how
did you build the company

319
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,700
into the giants that it is today?

320
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,330
- It was great during the.com boom

321
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,890
because money was sort of
falling off trees for investment.

322
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:28,050
It didn't matter that the
company was profitable or not,

323
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,080
but then you had the .com blow up

324
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,780
and that was very, very difficult,

325
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,820
because now you had to become profitable.

326
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,290
We almost went broke.

327
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,550
Worst of all by far, of course,
Danny is killed on nine 11,

328
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,890
and that was just devastating for us.

329
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,450
Our customers are going broke

330
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,680
because most of them were
.com-crazy companies,

331
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,670
so really, it's the people
we had in the company then,

332
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,080
that made the difference.

333
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,820
The technology really did work

334
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,910
and it was a matter of
getting real companies

335
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,740
to buy our services,

336
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,753
and we were fortunate that
we were able to do that

337
00:15:03,753 --> 00:15:07,860
in a way that we started
making money just in time.

338
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,120
Then we grew.

339
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,120
- So the cloud services
came online around 2007.

340
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,270
Was that important for your company?

341
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,010
- Yeah, it's interesting.

342
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,780
We were actually working
on edge computing,

343
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,320
distributed computing, way before AWS.

344
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,250
We were doing that in 2001, 2002,

345
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,440
but then, of course, the .com blow up,

346
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,820
we had to make massive cuts,

347
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,100
so we put that off to the side,

348
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,490
and AWS, it's amazing the
business they've built.

349
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,010
Now you have GCP and Azure as well.

350
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,650
Those guys are among our
largest customers today.

351
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,580
We do a lot of delivery for
them and we do their security,

352
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,050
and now we're actually getting
back into core compute,

353
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,250
so we have major data
centers like AWS would have,

354
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,130
and we're actually now in
the process of deploying VMs

355
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:06,060
and containers into edge regions.

356
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,060
So we have today, over 4,000
Edge locations in 750 cities,

357
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,010
and the goal this year
is to be able to have 100

358
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,250
of those cities where you can
run your VMs and containers.

359
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,137
- Does the machine learning
revolution have an impact on you

360
00:16:21,137 --> 00:16:24,960
and on on your customers,
on how you do things?

361
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,750
- We've been using ML and AI forever

362
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,400
in our security solutions.

363
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,460
Anomaly detection, is
it a bot, is it a human?

364
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,980
If it's a human with
the right credentials,

365
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,960
is it a thief that stole the credentials?

366
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,710
All those kinds of
things, AI is pivotal for.

367
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,930
Now, you got some pretty
cool (laughs) advances

368
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:47,390
with GenAI and LLMs, and
a lot of use cases there.

369
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,420
I would say today, it's
giving a quick leg up

370
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,830
to the attackers,

371
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,040
because you can use that to generate code,

372
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,440
and you can train it about malware

373
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,070
and you can train how to
get around the defenses,

374
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,500
and so anybody now can make great

375
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,320
or really dangerous malware,
and that's not good,

376
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,210
and so we're already seeing penetrations

377
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,722
into the big enterprises rapidly increase.

378
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:13,543
- What should we do about it?

379
00:17:13,543 --> 00:17:15,570
Because we have to stop the super villain.

380
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,880
- You need, more than
ever, defense in depth,

381
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,860
you need more than ever early detection

382
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,810
so you can detect the malwares in,

383
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,780
and we do now have the
market-leading solution to do that.

384
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,400
It's microsegmentation.

385
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,530
You gotta have an agent or a firewall

386
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,150
on every single app you have,

387
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,380
every single device,

388
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,050
and it's gotta govern
what that app can talk to,

389
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,150
it's gotta filter that communications,

390
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,820
'cause the malware is
in your internal network

391
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,890
and you've really (laughs)
gotta know where it is

392
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,350
and you gotta stop it from spreading.

393
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,800
Ransomware's not so bad if
it just gets into a server,

394
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,020
it's when it spreads
everywhere you got a problem.

395
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,050
Same with data exfiltration malware,

396
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,550
it gets into your HVAC system,

397
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,040
that's often where it'll go to call home,

398
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,630
not bad yet.

399
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,940
It's bad when it goes
and grabs all your data

400
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,180
and sends it out to
the command in control,

401
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,797
so I think microsegmentation

402
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:08,910
and the notion of very
localized internal firewalls

403
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,110
is very important.

404
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,210
- What do you see as the company outlook

405
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,310
for the next three to five years?

406
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,050
- We started in content delivery.

407
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,310
It's not our biggest business now.

408
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,260
Security is our biggest business. Yeah.

409
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,930
And I think, you go three to
five years, maybe compute,

410
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,140
cloud computing, 'cause that's
such an enormous market,

411
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,940
becomes the leading business for us,

412
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,670
but really is all those
things put together

413
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,880
in what is the world's
most distributed cloud.

414
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,220
The hyperscalers are
much bigger obviously,

415
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,630
but they're centralized.

416
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,180
They started in a data
center and then another,

417
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,770
and they have a small number today,

418
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,470
and Akamai started fully distributed

419
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,270
and we're in 4,000 locations

420
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,570
and now we're adding the
cloud computing aspect.

421
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,400
- Tom, you somehow managed
to be the superhero CEO,

422
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,790
a beloved teacher at MIT,
and also a researcher.

423
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,660
How do you manage to do it all?

424
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,610
- Well, I don't really do
research really anymore.

425
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,857
Every once in a while it's fun
to talk to somebody who is,

426
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:07,470
and the teaching I do every other fall

427
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,190
for the six 1,200 or 120,
they're gonna change the number,

428
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,220
and I do that instead of serving
on other corporate boards.

429
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,130
Most CEOs, you serve on a
couple other company boards

430
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,540
and it's about the same amount of time,

431
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,677
but I think much more interesting

432
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:23,730
and fun to teach six 1,200.

433
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,030
It's a chance also to talk to
the computer science students

434
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,340
about mathematics in a way

435
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,080
that I think is important for them,

436
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,090
and interesting, actually.

437
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,870
- What are some of the
pieces of advice you have

438
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,810
for the students who
aspire to be as impactful

439
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,940
and successful as you have been?

440
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,660
- I remember advice I
got when I was their age,

441
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,750
it was actually a Nobel Prize
winner talking to young kids

442
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,680
interested in science,

443
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,950
and he said that always
you wanna keep your eyes

444
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,410
and ears open and your brain turned on,

445
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,620
'cause you never know when
there's gonna be an opportunity

446
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,060
or a challenge presented,
that, if you're listening to it

447
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,160
and you see it, and you're thinking,

448
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,060
maybe you can make a contribution
and solve it, or help,

449
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,670
and I thought that was pretty good advice.

450
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,460
I think keeping an open mind,

451
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,470
just because something seems impossible

452
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,300
doesn't mean that it is,

453
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,510
and you know this, like
sometimes research problems

454
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,370
become homework problems, right?

455
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,450
Because once it's solved,

456
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,700
if you tell the student they
gotta do it for homework,

457
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,130
they figure it's solvable,
and then they do it,

458
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,530
and I think that's true in research

459
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,500
or tackling hard problems.

460
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,170
I remember somebody, a
knowledgeable guy in the field,

461
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,740
once saying that the only
reason Akamai was successful

462
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,450
is because we were too naive to know

463
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,990
what we were doing was impossible
and that couldn't be done,

464
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,150
and yeah, we were naive

465
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,020
and it just, well this made
sense to us theoreticians,

466
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,420
and you don't worry
about being in the box,

467
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,224
as a theoretician, and yeah,
it turns out it's possible.

468
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:58,410
- You gotta have guts.

469
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,630
- You do have to have,
yeah (giggles), tenacity,

470
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,830
that's for sure.

471
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,820
You gotta stick with it.

472
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,890
You wanna listen to the naysayers

473
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,450
and process what they say,

474
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,880
but if you think what
you're gonna do still works,

475
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,620
you gotta keep at it.

476
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,080
- What about the education side?

477
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,420
What should the students focus on?

478
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,430
What do you see as the role of theory,

479
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,430
versus systems, versus other
subfields of computer science?

480
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,210
- I do think they're all important.

481
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:27,120
Of course, I grew up in
theory, always partial to that,

482
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,940
and the rigor I think,
is really important.

483
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,180
I gained a lot of
appreciation for systems,

484
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,440
(laughs) through Akamai.

485
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,750
There's a big difference, I learned,

486
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,140
between writing an algorithm on paper

487
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,490
and proving a theorem,

488
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:45,750
and developing code that's
gonna work in the real world.

489
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,910
Very, very different endeavors,

490
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,540
and I gained a lot of respect
for what the systems folks do

491
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,190
and the engineers do.

492
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,980
- Tom, thank you so much
for all your contributions

493
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,790
to us at MIT, to computing, to the world.

494
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,010
You are really such an inspiration

495
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,300
and I'm gonna try really hard

496
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,350
to have more interdisciplinary
collaborations within CSAIL

497
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,390
to look for the next nugget

498
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,760
that could be as successful as Akamai.

499
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,100
- Awesome. Well, CSAIL is great.

500
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,070
Really appreciate your leadership here,

501
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,690
'cause it is a gem here.

502
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,260
Just really, really valuable,
I think for humanity broadly.

503
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,990
- Well, it's the people
who make it wonderful,

504
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:29,100
and you are one of our
superheroes, so thank you, Tom.

505
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,933
- Thank you.
