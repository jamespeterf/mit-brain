1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
(bright music)

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,330
- Just like everyone in
the room is different,

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,480
every cell and every single
molecule is different.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,690
I have always been fascinated by biology.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,080
What excites me the most is
really the ability to see

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,350
how molecules move around and interact.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,730
My research group focuses

8
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,490
on developing new photostable probe

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,760
that allows us to do long-term
single-molecule tracking

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,050
inside living systems.

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,240
We know that diseases are often caused

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,310
by mutations in certain proteins,

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,820
and so now if we can really
visualize the differences

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,440
of the molecular dynamics,

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,170
we can potentially screen
for small molecules

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,810
that can help revert
this kind of behavior.

17
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,710
This will be very useful
information to guide our design

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,933
of the next generation of therapeutics.

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,680
Because this is a
relatively new technology,

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,560
we need to optimize many different fields.

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,290
I'm really fortunate to be
able to recruit our students

22
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,090
with very different skills.

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,800
Students who can synthesize

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,690
and optimize these nanoparticles.

25
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,940
We also have students
who are good at optics

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,740
and can build the microscopes.

27
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,690
And so these students are really talented

28
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,190
and they're really driven

29
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,468
to really push the frontier
of our scientific research.

30
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:14,430
(uplifting music)

31
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,680
Our goal is really to solve important

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,900
and challenging biological questions,

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,830
and so this is very hard
to do in a more traditional

34
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,360
and pure discipline.

35
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,540
Traditionally, people use
dyes and fluorescent proteins

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,640
to look at individual molecules,

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,180
but these kinds of probes
bleach within tens of seconds,

38
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,390
so we can't look at processes
much longer than that.

39
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,770
With our photostable probe,

40
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,680
we can really visualize with great spatial

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,380
and temporal resolutions, great detail.

42
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,810
And so whenever you have a new technology

43
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,450
that can allow you to image faster

44
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,010
with higher spatial resolution

45
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:52,050
and with longer periods of time,

46
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,730
you are bound to see something new.

47
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,490
So I'm really excited that
we are entering this region

48
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,320
where we can really investigate
many unexplored territories.

49
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,080
Broad is really the perfect
place for my research group

50
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,340
because I get to interact

51
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,250
with the very best biologists in the world

52
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,020
to really know the most challenging

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,420
and pressing questions
so that we can come up

54
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,840
with new ideas in
developing new technologies

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,210
to help answer these questions.

56
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,250
To me, the point is not to publish

57
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,870
as many papers as possible

58
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,660
but really is to make a bigger impact.

59
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,760
And I feel like developing something new

60
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,497
can really offer you the opportunity.

61
00:02:28,497 --> 00:02:31,330
