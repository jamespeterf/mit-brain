37
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,079
think about that. A whole year just flew

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,600

39
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,200

as a designer for more

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,520
uh for about three years before starting

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,520
at Sloan in 22.

49
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,400
>> Hi everyone, my name is Jennisha Cole.

50
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,200
Uh I graduated from the Sloan Fellows

51
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,560
program in 2023. I'm originally from

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,239
Singapore. Um and before Sloan I was I

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,160
spent about 10 years in the health tech

54
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,840
industry. Uh my background is in

55
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,000
engineering. So I I did you know the

56
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,200
gamut of things um from product

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,519
development all the way to

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,160
commercialization of new devices. And

59
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,120
right after Sloan I kind of switched my

60
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,760
role into a more commercial role leading

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,440
market expansion in the US. and more

62
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,840
recently I've joined the life insurance

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,840
industry as a program manager leading

64
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,319
digital transformation in marketing

65
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,519
analytics. Yeah, so very excited to be

66
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,519
here today. Thank you all.

67
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,519
Thank you to our panelists for

68
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,440
introducing themselves. So we'll just uh

69
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,840
jump right in and get started with some

70
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,599
highle questions first. Um and these

71
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,519
questions will just be open to all

72
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,760
panelists or any all of the questions

73
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,599
will be open to all panelists and um

74
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,280
they can choose to decide if they want

75
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,000
to share. So we'll kind of start off a

76
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,560
little bit easy um and ask our panelists

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,120
why did they choose uh MIT Sloan.

78
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:32,000
>> I can I can start with this one. Uh so I

79
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,560
it's funny because uh I think come

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
coming from an architecture background

81
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,920
it's not it's kind of like a

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,159
non-traditional

83
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,200
background to come into an MBA and I was

84
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,920
talking to people at my my previous job

85
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,920
and somebody recommended MIT as a place

86
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,879
that is kind of like very innovative and

87
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,720
diverse and uh just because of the the

88
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,159
amount of different programs and also

89
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,360
how it is housed in the larger MIT um

90
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,280
campus.

91
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,879
And that's kind of when I started uh

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,159
engaging with the program and and

93
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,959
talking to some people. So that's kind

94
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,400
of like what ultimately ended up driving

95
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,439
my decision to come to Sloan that uh met

96
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,599
so many people from different

97
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,040
backgrounds. It's a very welcoming

98
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,479
atmosphere and I think the work that I

99
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,600
was doing kind of was leaning on leaning

100
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:22,000
on a lot of the innovation uh work and

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,280
that found I found that very interesting

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
uh from the beginning at Sloan just

103
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,800
being at the cutting edge of of

104
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,400
technology and seeing that h kind of

105
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,199
happen all around me.

106
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,800
>> Thank you so much Andreas. Um does

107
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,600
anybody else want to kind of share their

108
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,000
experience on why we loan?

109
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,520
I'm happy to yeah share a little bit as

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,120
well. I think there's some similarities

111
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,280
with Andreas uh on this for me. Um so my

112
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,800
background is prior to Sloan I was

113
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,720
working in uh Kenya leading um like a

114
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,199
software uh sort of like platform

115
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,520
development uh for like a distributed

116
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,040
forestry company. Um so I was already in

117
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,919
kind of like tech tech and product

118
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,160
management and startup world and I was

119
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,280
kind of like self-taught on all of those

120
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,720
things. Um, and what I wanted out of a

121
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,720
business school I think were like a

122
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,520
strong community at the intersection of

123
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,440
sort of like technology both like in the

124
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,560
MBA program and also like outside

125
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,320
obviously which MIT is um essentially

126
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,680
that and then uh like a strong

127
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,919
entrepreneurship ecosystem and

128
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,680
entrepreneurship resources um and then

129
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,360
that that component of innovation as

130
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,360
well that that Andress was mentioning.

131
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,039
So that was the big reason why I

132
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,160
initially wanted to join MIT Sloan. And

133
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,840
then after I um got accepted and started

134
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,240
talking to students, I just really

135
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,759
thought that Sloanies were like really

136
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,680
just really friendly collaborative group

137
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,680
of people. Everyone I met was like so

138
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,360
nice to me and wanted to engage and so

139
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,120
that definitely also helped make that

140
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,120
choice or solidify that choice.

141
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,440
>> Yeah. So for me, I have a slightly

142
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,680
different perspective. So, by the time I

143
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,520
decided that I wanted to do my MBA, I've

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,639
already had almost a decade of work

145
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,720
experience my pocket. So, the the

146
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,639
thought about doing a two-year um MBA

147
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,759
program was a little intimidating given,

148
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,360
you know, my experience and also my age.

149
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,240
Um so, I was just looking at, you know,

150
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,759
programs out there that really could fit

151
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,520
my needs in terms of what I want to get

152
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,240
out of MBA program, which is to level up

153
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,720
my business skills, grow my career in

154
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,720
the health tech sector. And as I was

155
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,199
looking around, I wanted something that

156
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,759
is more is globally recognized and also

157
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,560
yet provided that immersive MBA

158
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,720
experience um that a regular to a

159
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,240
regular MBA student would go through. So

160
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,319
Sloan really fit that bucket with the

161
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,319
Sloan Fellows program and I'm happy to

162
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,800
chat more about that as well. It's it's

163
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,199
the perfect balance between an executive

164
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,039
MBA program and a regular MBA for those

165
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,720
with like 10 to 15 years of experience

166
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,600
just like what Terrell has mentioned.

167
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,440
Yeah.

168
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,479
Thanks everyone. Um the next question

169
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,240
we'll have here is kind of diving into

170
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,720
um how were you involved in the Sloan

171
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,520
community while you're at MIT? I think

172
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,759
like the first club that I joined at

173
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,919
Sloan um not that community is

174
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,360
necessarily only that but that was kind

175
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,880
of like the first thing was the first

176
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,280
generation low-income club. Um and um

177
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,440
there was kind of a like I'm also like a

178
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,520
first generation college graduate. So

179
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,919
that was kind of like um a community

180
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,000
that first really welcomed me and helped

181
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,639
me kind of like figure out okay so

182
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,400
here's how how everything works how you

183
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,160
know business school works how you pick

184
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,919
your classes which ones are good ones

185
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,919
how do you look for internships so like

186
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,599
just a lot of that support and also kind

187
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,520
of just like general social support so

188
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,720
that was the first kind of community

189
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,120
that I joined there's many others and um

190
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,680
I think following that first semester I

191
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,840
then joined the leadership um kind of uh

192
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,520
of of the of the first gen low-inccome

193
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,759
club and so on and so I was like pre

194
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,000
co-president um with some of my uh

195
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,000
colleagues and and good friends uh that

196
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,280
was one and also because I lived in

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,160
Kenya for um you know six years prior to

198
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,639
Sloan I also joined the Africa business

199
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,039
club and I was really excited just about

200
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,800
like all of the kind of students who

201
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,639
were in that club and all of the

202
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,639
experiences they were bringing from the

203
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,800
continent from all over many different

204
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,960
countries and organizing also the Africa

205
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,400
Innovate Conference which just like a

206
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,160
huge uh really like great event that

207
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,400
brings like so many kind of like

208
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,000
innovators, entrepreneurs, really great

209
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,720
people from the continent. So, it was

210
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,519
just really fun to help like organize

211
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,440
that and and and be part of it. Um those

212
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,519
were just like two kind of highlights.

213
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,800
Um there's many others, but yeah, I'll

214
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,800
let someone else chime in as well.

215
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,080
>> Yeah. So for myself um there like like

216
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,240
what Draana has mentioned there are so

217
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,080
many clubs you can choose from it's very

218
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,080
diverse um and there you know clubs that

219
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,839
cater to different interests so for me

220
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,920
myself uh coming from a health tech

221
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,640
background I also did immerse myself

222
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,360
more in the healthcare club as well as

223
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,680
um joining a hackathon called MIT

224
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,480
hacking medicine as a community member

225
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,800
so that's how um I got to you know

226
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,240
immerse myself more more with the

227
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,080
networks that are within MIT itself. Um

228
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,720
and at the same time there were also

229
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,000
class level communities. So there was a

230
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,959
culture club within um my program itself

231
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,360
where we actually had a cultural night

232
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,080
um to expose stu um classmates to

233
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,600
different cuisines and c traditions uh

234
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,839
from their home country. So that was a

235
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,839
really enjoyable experience for me.

236
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,839
Yeah.

237
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:49,920
Um, for for me, uh, I think I

238
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,839
I as as Draana Janisa mentioned already

239
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,080
that there's there's so many clubs,

240
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,399
there's so many groups and I I was one

241
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,560
of those that signed up to a lot of them

242
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,839
first semester and kind of started

243
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,000
getting more and more involved in some

244
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,600
of them as like as the time went by. But

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,600
so I kind of like was more active on the

246
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,080
Latin American business club, the

247
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,160
Hispanic Business Club, and the real

248
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:16,000
estate club. Um they

249
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,120
the real estate club primarily because

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,360
that's where my career interests were.

251
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,000
Uh and given and given my background in

252
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,200
architecture is also kind of it's a it's

253
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,680
an interesting club that it kind of like

254
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,120
lives within two house within two

255
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,320
different programs. lives under Sloan,

256
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,120
but there's also a lot of people that

257
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,480
you meet from outside uh across the

258
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,079
school, outside of the outside of the

259
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,839
Sloan group and got to meet a lot of uh

260
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,279
cool Sloan through that too and got

261
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,640
really close and also Lat Latin American

262
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,800
business club and Hispanic Business

263
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,399
Club. Uh I think that's where I met a

264
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,640
lot of a a lot of friends that I still

265
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,560
kept in touch with and

266
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,800
uh also

267
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,000
all the all the events that they plan. I

268
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,600
kind of become like a really really

269
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,360
great way to kind of build community and

270
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,519
as Braana mentioned it's kind of like

271
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,279
one of the most it's it's a really

272
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,200
welcoming community that I think uh

273
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,880
helped me pretty much through all all

274
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,480
anything that I would run into any

275
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,079
issues with recruiting or any issues

276
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,200
with classwork or just like personal

277
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:21,040
stuff. So I think those two affinity

278
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,120
clubs became really important to me. Uh

279
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,959
and I think the ocean the ocean

280
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,720
structure of the MBA program was also

281
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,480
very uh helpful. Uh I think was like a

282
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,839
great way to kind of start meeting a lot

283
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,440
of people and like helping helping

284
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,560
organize some of those community events

285
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,000
and those like Christmas uh social

286
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,120
gatherings and that kind of stuff was

287
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,279
like I think a great part of my

288
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,440
experience that I really enjoyed helping

289
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,279
out with.

290
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,880
>> Thanks everyone. Andres, I wanted to

291
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,120
kind of tap in what you said just to

292
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,440
share with our prospective students what

293
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,560
oceans are. Could you give um just a

294
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:01,360
highle overview of what an ocean is?

295
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:04,560
>> Yeah, of course. So, for the general MBA

296
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,320
program, uh the class size is about 4

297
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,560
and some change 440 420 not entirely

298
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,440
sure what the number is, but that's the

299
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,000
larger class. And then for the first

300
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,800
year, for the first semester,

301
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,440
you're you're you're in the you're

302
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,320
organized into subgroups called oceans

303
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,360
that are kind of like about maybe 60 70

304
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,320
people. And they kind of really become

305
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,120
like a really a really close-knit group

306
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,160
within the larger the larger 400 and

307
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,240
something uh people in the program that

308
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,600
you take every class together. uh you

309
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,240
you have like one elective that you can

310
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,240
do the first semester, but but you

311
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,320
really kind of share the classroom day

312
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,240
in day out and you're you have a bunch

313
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,079
of different events and you have your

314
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,160
and within the 60 people group, you also

315
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,720
have your core team. So it's it's kind

316
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,000
of like an a way to create community the

317
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,600
first semester especially for

318
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,480
uh

319
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,000
especially it was really

320
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,200
I guess it was I guess it was really

321
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,959
important for me because it coming into

322
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,680
such a large program with so many new

323
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:17,760
things it can it can be an overwhelming

324
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,320
place but the group of 70 pe 67 people

325
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,639
that I was with in day in day out in the

326
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,959
classes it became like a support group

327
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,279
for everybody. So, everybody was able to

328
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,680
kind of share experiences and and trade

329
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,200
notes and and kind of help each other

330
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,680
out in a very meaningful way just

331
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,959
because of the the size that we were at

332
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,959
and seeing each other so often.

333
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,920
>> And thank you so much for that. Um, so

334
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,480
we'll kind of dive into more specific

335
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,800
FGLI questions or first generation

336
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,800
lowincome questions um to give the

337
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,959
students uh or the perspective students

338
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,040
here a little bit more insight into what

339
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:59,040
it's like to be um a Fly student. So,

340
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,360
uh, we'll kind of start off with as a

341
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,519
first generation college graduate, are

342
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,279
there any specific, uh, scholarships or

343
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,279
support programs that they should know

344
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,279
of

345
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,760
and that you've utilized.

346
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,120
There were definitely like if I remember

347
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,880
correct so I I've forgotten a little bit

348
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,120
because it's been a while now since I

349
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,680
graduated. Well, a while three I guess

350
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,920
three years almost. Um there were

351
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,519
definitely like some smaller funds I

352
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,760
remember um available for students. I

353
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,279
think um for example like if you're

354
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,959
experiencing financial hardship there

355
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,920
were some some funds that you could tap

356
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,440
into. I think uh also some for sort of

357
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,480
like some of the events cuz some of the

358
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,199
events are kind of like paid events that

359
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,040
that um like as part of the MBA program

360
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,800
that you could like draw support from

361
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,880
for for that specifically. Um, yeah, I

362
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,800
think I would, yeah, I want to maybe

363
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,120
sort of like tag someone else who's been

364
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,639
there more recently to tell us about it,

365
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,120
but there's definitely been been um some

366
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,800
some kind of like sort of like smaller

367
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,160
funds and resources that that we've been

368
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,160
able to tap into during my time there.

369
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:26,480
uh well okay I don't know about the and

370
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,480
have used but piece of it but one that I

371
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,120
didn't use but I wish I would have used

372
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,519
and it's not a loan program but I know

373
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,160
that a lot of people did the to the togo

374
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,279
fellowships especi uh for people that

375
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,600
are kind of like um I think it's a

376
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,120
little more finance leaning uh people

377
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,399
with an interest in finance I didn't do

378
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,000
it but I know a lot of people that did

379
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,079
it and I know that it's a great resource

380
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,720
and and I didn't know and I didn't know

381
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:55,040
about it when I started the MBA. uh

382
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,199
within Sloan uh the I think the student

383
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,920
groups can actually become a really good

384
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:05,120
resource because the the

385
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,800
yeah I think I think this is the I'm

386
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,560
talking about what Terl is mentioning in

387
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,360
the comments that some of the some of

388
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,199
the activities that we would do uh this

389
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,440
with this with the Hispanic business

390
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,600
club or with the FLI group uh I remember

391
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,440
there's some there's some travel

392
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,880
opportunities ities. There's some uh um

393
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,120
some travel opportunities that

394
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,839
student life office or the student

395
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,360
groups can kind of like apply for. And

396
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,120
in that way, I participated in some of

397
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,880
those activities that are off campus or

398
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,120
that might that I know that that's kind

399
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,240
of like a big thing and can and can be a

400
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,360
financial hardship. Uh

401
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:49,279
but I think

402
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,519
I think one one thing that I that I that

403
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,680
I would like to mention though is that

404
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:58,800
it always felt like when there was any

405
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,440
kind of need uh the student the program

406
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,600
program managers and student life office

407
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,160
it's was always within reach and super

408
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:11,360
approachable. So any kind of uh

409
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,400
any kind of question would be would they

410
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,600
would always be open to kind of like

411
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,000
have like a very holistic and

412
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,959
comprehensive answer that

413
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,439
would pretty much solve what you're

414
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,120
looking for. And so I did reach out the

415
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,959
to the program manager a few times and

416
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,039
was able to kind of get some guidance

417
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:33,000
and find the support that I needed in or

418
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,000
the programs that I was looking for.

419
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:40,320
>> Yeah. So for um for me I did not um rely

420
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,919
a lot on like financial assistance or

421
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,400
maybe because like like what Andrea say

422
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,080
I haven't done much research on that but

423
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,200
I've heard about external funding

424
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,480
sources. Um so similar to go there's

425
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,480
also the forte women MBA fund that you

426
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
can look into. I I do know a couple of

427
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,600
classmates who actually got a small

428
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,840
fellowship out of that. Um so I believe

429
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,039
there are external um bodies that you

430
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,679
can actually refer to as well. Yeah. And

431
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,039
to echo what Andre um mentioned, you can

432
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,440
always reach out to the student life

433
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,160
office and they will offer you avenues

434
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,160
to look for um funds whenever you need

435
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,160
them.

436
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,799
>> Thank you, Janisha. Our next question

437
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,640
here is for students who come from

438
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,039
non-traditional or low-income

439
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,880
backgrounds, what specific resources or

440
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,640
networks at Sloan have been the most

441
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,600
impactful in building confidence and

442
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,600
access to leadership roles?

443
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,760
I think for me and I definitely come

444
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:54,720
from a little bit of a like

445
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:59,600
non-traditional background as in sort of

446
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:03,039
emerging markets startup um tech space

447
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,480
um coming into MBA and wanting to

448
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,880
transition into sort of like a big tech

449
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,679
product management uh and kind of

450
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,520
leadership. I think um I definitely did

451
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,240
rely on my sort of

452
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,799
colleagues and friends from the the fly

453
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,160
club. Um so a lot of them especially the

454
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,840
second years um as we came in

455
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,200
you'll always find people who are like

456
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,320
interested in the same things that

457
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,679
you're interested in. And that's the

458
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,679
thing with Sloan like you'll always find

459
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,440
people who have like made the pivot that

460
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,360
you're trying to make or have done

461
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,039
something that you're trying to do. And

462
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,480
so like what's great about that is you

463
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:43,280
just sort of like if you talk about like

464
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,039
what you want um then the people the

465
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,120
people and the help somehow finds you.

466
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,520
So definitely for me the fly club

467
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,760
members have been helpful for example

468
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,679
for things like interviewing when I was

469
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,559
like applying to Amazon like applying

470
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,840
for these uh big tech companies applying

471
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,679
for leadership roles um then in in in

472
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,000
other clubs as well like other business

473
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,559
clubs at Sloan. So those are very

474
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,480
helpful. And then also just like other

475
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,600
kind of like

476
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,720
like career focused clubs um where um

477
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,000
there will be a lot of different

478
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,200
programs that will help you like

479
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,799
especially not knowing like you want to

480
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,320
go into consulting you don't know how

481
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,320
that works like what is it that you need

482
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,679
to do you'll have career office that

483
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,280
helps you do that and then you'll have

484
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,200
like the consulting club for me it was

485
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,520
like the product management club I had

486
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,760
no idea what like product management

487
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,120
cases were and like how to do that so

488
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,799
there was a lot of folks who helped me

489
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,480
both from the fly club and the product

490
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,520
management club and the career office to

491
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,520
kind of like get there um and like get

492
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,400
my internship and get my full-time role

493
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,240
down the line. So definitely I think

494
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,880
just like broader Sloan community I

495
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,120
would say and then your specific

496
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,039
career interest and affinity groups are

497
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,280
definitely helpful with that navigating

498
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,280
that process.

499
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,679
So I just want to add that um because

500
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,240
Sloan is so diverse

501
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,400
what I what my personally what I feel

502
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:14,720
social economic status is just one part

503
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,320
of it there. So what really helped me is

504
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,760
taking up some of the leadership classes

505
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,840
where you get to understand yourself

506
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,240
better, understand your strength,

507
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,520
understand the value that you can convey

508
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,240
um whenever you you come to a group. And

509
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,240
I think MIT Sloan just has a neck for

510
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,799
choosing people. I would say at least

511
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,799
80% of the people um who are humbed

512
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,720
and willing to learn from people from

513
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,000
various backgrounds. So I never felt

514
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,360
like coming from a you know fli was a

515
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,760
was something that I had to constantly

516
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,760
remind myself about. Um and there were

517
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,440
and like Jordan say there are avenues to

518
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,360
build confidence by taking up leadership

519
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,200
positions in clubs and definitely fli is

520
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,640
not a qualifying factor in that. It's

521
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,320
more like what value you want to bring

522
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,600
to the table and what you want to learn

523
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,600
out of the experience. Yeah.

524
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:12,080
>> Yeah. I I I agree with what Denisha and

525
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:16,559
Draa have said for sure. I think the

526
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,159
diverse the diverse community and

527
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,240
uh

528
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,440
being able to being able to talk to

529
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,640
anybody about what you want and then if

530
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,400
you don't know the if you don't know the

531
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,760
person across the room then that person

532
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,840
that you just talked to will introduce

533
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,440
you and they'll be able to guide you

534
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,960
better into what you're into what you're

535
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,080
starting to explore if you're actually

536
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,520
interested in. I I think it just becomes

537
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,120
I think the community, the people that

538
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,120
are in the room with you, it's like such

539
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,720
an open place that you can ask questions

540
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,480
that you might not be able to ask

541
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,640
anywhere else. And them those answers

542
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,320
being so readily available. Maybe

543
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,600
somebody maybe the person that's sitting

544
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,760
next to you but just didn't know, you

545
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,080
just didn't happen to talk to them, but

546
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,360
somebody else makes that introduction. I

547
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:03,360
think those social connections are

548
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:07,440
are extremely uh valuable in empowering

549
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,559
you and trying to in make

550
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,440
sure that you're getting to the place

551
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,200
that you that you want to be. Uh whether

552
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,679
that is uh something in leadership in a

553
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,440
club or or looking for or talking to the

554
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,200
right person at at some com at some

555
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,000
company that you're interested in in

556
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,720
recruiting for. Uh, and also I think the

557
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,240
the question is uh maybe what's on

558
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,760
campus and like what's in Sloan, but I

559
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,520
think when you're when you're Sloan and

560
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,559
you're a student, being able to talk to

561
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,760
the alumni, it's a great resource. I

562
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:42,880
think I I talked to a lot of alumni just

563
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,720
trying to also figure out what is it

564
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,080
that I wanted to do and all these

565
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,039
different avenues that I never heard of

566
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,559
before. uh and that and just having

567
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,480
those informal conversations with any

568
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,720
with people that people that are open to

569
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,080
talk to you because you're a student was

570
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,720
extremely valuable and really helpful

571
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,559
for me with some as for as somebody that

572
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,240
uh from a nontraditional background and

573
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:07,760
also uh first generation college grad

574
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,520
and also grad grad. So I think

575
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,120
everybody's being so open and talking

576
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,760
and and willing to help you. I think

577
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,760
it's extremely valuable.

578
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,559
Thank you everyone. Um so the next

579
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,240
question I'm going to ask is more about

580
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,120
uh the financial trade-offs. Um

581
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,159
specifically for fly students uh an MBA

582
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,080
can be really costly and so uh what

583
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,240
financial trade-offs did you face during

584
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,760
the program and how did you navigate

585
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,919
them without compromising your

586
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,919
experience or contributions or rather

587
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,919
ambitions?

588
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,480
I can talk, but I also feel like I

589
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:56,799
always talk first. I don't know. Do I

590
00:24:52,480 --> 00:25:00,559
That's fine. Yeah. Cool. Um, I think

591
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,799
like, yeah, I think that it is for

592
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,840
coming from like a firstgen low-inccome

593
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,840
background, it's almost like when you

594
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,520
look at that, like when you're on the

595
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,279
outside and you're applying and you're

596
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,039
like looking at that price tag and

597
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,799
you're figuring out like how do I even

598
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:19,760
do this, right? Um, it is a serious

599
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,440
investment. Um, and that's just

600
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,200
something to acknowledge, right? It is a

601
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,960
serious. So like I'll just talk a little

602
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,400
bit about like the way I did it, right?

603
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,200
So like one thing that I did even as I

604
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,720
was sort of like applying I was

605
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
literally putting in the spreadsheet.

606
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,080
All right, like what is this investment

607
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,080
that I would have to make like maybe

608
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,760
what's the expected scholarship that I

609
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,159
could get, right? Like that could be a

610
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,760
range. So you kind of like apply you

611
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,240
apply and then you may get a merit-based

612
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,919
scholarship. I got some but not all of

613
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,679
it of course. Maybe there's some

614
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:51,679
external scholarships. maybe there's

615
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,200
some personal savings, right? And then

616
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,840
maybe there's some financing and loans

617
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,760
that you're gonna like take out um to be

618
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,440
able to like make this work for you. So,

619
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,760
I literally made a spreadsheet with all

620
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,159
of this information and then kind of

621
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,520
like put all right like leaving business

622
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,200
school and this was one of the

623
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,840
tradeoffs, right? Like leaving business

624
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,400
school is like for me to like make sure

625
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,840
I can like pay back for this for like

626
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,600
this education and everything like what

627
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,279
do I have to do? And I was like all

628
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,520
right well I don't think I can

629
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,080
temporarily go back to like you know my

630
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,279
social impact work that I did in in

631
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,200
Kenya at this rate but then again and so

632
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,000
that is a tradeoff right but then again

633
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,640
I can you know like the job that I would

634
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,400
be getting in product in the states

635
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,159
would definitely like according to my

636
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,840
spreadsheet within the next five years

637
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,840
like help me get where I want to get

638
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,039
right so it's a little bit and I'm not

639
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,880
saying like everyone needs to do this

640
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,559
kind of like long-term planning right

641
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,640
but it is a little bit understanding

642
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,279
like all right so maybe with this

643
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,679
investment I am going to have c certain

644
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,760
potential short-term career tradeoffs

645
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,919
but also potential like long-term career

646
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,600
gains so I think that's kind of like my

647
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,080
personal experience at the moment I'm

648
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,159
having like a I was having a short-term

649
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,600
potential tradeoff but then kind of a

650
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,400
long-term gain of like the experience

651
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,000
that I'm getting um and kind of like

652
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,000
where I'm on track to like sort of like

653
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,480
meet some of my other financial goals

654
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,799
and yeah and I think also during the MBA

655
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,960
program like budgeting is the thing,

656
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,400
right? So, like there's going to be a

657
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,159
lot of things that you want to do. Like

658
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,400
there's going to be a lot of like trips

659
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,760
and events and things. So, some of the

660
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,120
trade-offs is like, well, you have to

661
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,880
pick and choose, right? If you can't

662
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,799
like, you know, afford all of them or

663
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,039
pay for all of them, like you pick the

664
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,640
ones that you want to do most, you pick

665
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,559
the ones that have some like financial

666
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,799
assistance that comes with it, you pick.

667
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,760
So, it is you can still have like a very

668
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,159
good experience and very full experience

669
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,480
with some of this sort of like careful

670
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,080
budgeting and short and long-term

671
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,679
trade-offs that you make and still get

672
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,760
to your goals. Uh, it's just kind of

673
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,000
being aware that that it is a big

674
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:57,559
investment and it requires some kind of

675
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,559
like um I guess more careful planning.

676
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,279
>> Yeah. So for myself, I did take a loan

677
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,840
and very much like what Draguna said, I

678
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:09,919
also did a spreadsheet to measure what's

679
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,760
the the MPV of the education, right? Uh

680
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,919
and I have to say it's it's kind of hard

681
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,240
to quantify, especially in uncertain

682
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,480
economic times, but one thing I know for

683
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,480
sure is the intrinsic value of the MBA

684
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,360
is going to take me further in my career

685
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,200
and even even my life experiences. So I

686
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,159
constantly kept that in mind. And just

687
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,919
to add on um to like you know looking

688
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:34,320
for funds um when you are in school um

689
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,960
besides like external scholarships um

690
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,480
you know financial aids there are also

691
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,799
ways you can earn money while you're on

692
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,120
campus for instance doing an internship

693
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,760
you can be a teaching assistant you can

694
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,320
be a research assistant and those do

695
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,080
cover some of your tuition as well um if

696
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,600
you can and if if those fit into your

697
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,440
schedule it can be a pretty fulfilling

698
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,039
experience when where you get to work

699
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,799
with like the professors and students at

700
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,559
the same time. Yeah. So, that's

701
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,600
something to to consider as well, like

702
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:03,360
the flexibility of getting your um

703
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,480
studies funded while still having their

704
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,480
full-time experience. Yeah.

705
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:14,559
>> Yeah. I I'll say that uh maybe my

706
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,880
approach wasn't as structured as Doranas

707
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,080
or Denisia.

708
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,679
Uh but I

709
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,440
I mean I think that's well that was one

710
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,480
of the takeaways from being in so that I

711
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,240
can actually be more structured about

712
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:32,480
those things now. Uh I think for sure

713
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,240
though I I there there was

714
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,320
it was a mix a mix of different sources

715
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,559
that that kind of allowed me to do this.

716
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,679
And I also definitely saw it as a

717
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:44,720
long-term investment in in myself and my

718
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,960
growth and my and my financial goals for

719
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,640
the long term. uh just because of the

720
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,720
place that I went to before uh it was it

721
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,279
was it was clearly not heading in the

722
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,720
direction that I wanted to be uh in the

723
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,720
long term. So I think it was a

724
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,159
combination of a combination of scholars

725
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,000
from from Sloan that uh allowed me to

726
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,760
allowed me to have a little bit of a

727
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,279
little bit of to make the decision to

728
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,440
begin with and also a little bit of

729
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:14,320
loans but also being a little bit

730
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,559
strategic on the types of things that I

731
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,080
wanted to do while in loan like it like

732
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,440
Draana mentioned there is there is a lot

733
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,320
of trips there is a lot of events there

734
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,600
is a lot of these things but

735
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,240
uh there's

736
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,440
Not

737
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,559
there's there's things that are

738
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,600
definitely that you can participate and

739
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:40,000
see them as kind of like helping helping

740
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,760
you get the full experience when

741
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,760
I get I guess like maybe like the way

742
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,120
that I was strategic about picking the

743
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,600
things that I was doing is just having

744
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,080
kind of like a well diversified

745
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,799
uh things list of things that I was

746
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,000
doing when you can just kind of you can

747
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,960
go to certain certain events, you can

748
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,039
go, you can do certain trips, but uh at

749
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,440
least being able to say that that I was

750
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,919
that I did certain amount of things once

751
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,000
and and fully being present and and

752
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,159
being able to engage with the with the

753
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,480
people that were there or with the or

754
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,760
with the professionals from outside of

755
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,520
Zone that I was speaking to for a

756
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:18,559
certain event outside of the city or

757
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:20,159
stuff like that. Uh, I think I I was I

758
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,399
feel like I was able to get a a full

759
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,039
experience by just

760
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:29,279
picking from a wide range of different

761
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:35,200
opportunities instead of uh repeating

762
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:36,559
them over and over. Um, so and I I think

763
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,320
I think that kind of like that's the

764
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,320
perspective that I took more than

765
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,320
anything.

766
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,440
Okay, we'll have our last question um

767
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,799
from me as moderator and then we'll dive

768
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,320
into the Q&A uh open Q&A from the

769
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:01,120
audience. Um so the last question here

770
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,519
um is how does Sloan intentionally build

771
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,399
a sense of belonging and community among

772
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,399
students from different backgrounds?

773
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:17,840
Uh, I can jump in on this one. Um, I

774
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,360
think I I don't know if I did a great

775
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,000
job earlier about explaining what the

776
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,279
oceans are, but I think the oceans was

777
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,640
kind of like the high one of the

778
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,480
highlights for me from the beginning

779
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,000
because like it was such a it was such

780
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,799
an impactful way of building community

781
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,600
from the get-go that you have this team

782
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,519
of 60 people where you have an offsite

783
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,399
the first week of the of the year where

784
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,559
you get to meet them and have like very

785
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,240
you get to you get to know them very

786
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,880
personally and you're kind of encouraged

787
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,919
to be vulnerable with them and have kind

788
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:54,159
of meaningful conversations that I think

789
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,240
that was my my first uh aha moment of

790
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:01,120
being like okay everybody everybody here

791
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:03,760
is interested in in seeing you grow and

792
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:07,120
that you can actually have very

793
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:09,760
meaningful interactions and have very

794
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,240
um you can create kind of very

795
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,840
meaningful communities as long as you're

796
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,279
as long as you're engaging and you want

797
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,440
and you and you want to build the same

798
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,120
community. I think the the the first

799
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,480
touch point of the oceans was like what

800
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,559
really impactful for me and then that

801
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,799
kind of set the tone for everything else

802
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,320
afterwards. Uh being able to also carry

803
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,440
that kind of sense of community and

804
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:33,360
openness and willingness to willingness

805
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:37,120
to share what you what you know to the

806
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,519
people around you and also uh being able

807
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,840
to remain open and vulnerable and ask

808
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,039
the questions that you that you want to

809
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,279
that you want to hear people's

810
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:49,440
experiences of. Um so that's that's kind

811
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,440
of like what I what impacted me the

812
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,440
most.

813
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,159
I can speak to the Sloan Fellows

814
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,720
program. So the Sloan Fellows program

815
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:05,679
typically has about like hundred um to

816
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,679
120 students. So it's a good size where

817
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,720
you get to know everyone and I think

818
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,919
Sloan has the Sloan um program office

819
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,760
has done a great job in ensuring that um

820
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,879
every one or two months there are

821
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,359
bonding you know events u activities

822
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,359
that happen. So for instance in fall you

823
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,480
have like apple picking because it's app

824
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:29,200
apple season. Um towards the end of the

825
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,679
year we have like a trip to like you

826
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,639
know somewhere nearby. So for my year we

827
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,800
did get caught. Um so depending on on

828
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,240
what the program offices plan out and at

829
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,440
the same time I did mention throughout

830
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,520
the year as well that there are

831
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,440
different um committees that were formed

832
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,679
within the program itself. So I did

833
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,639
mention one about the cultural community

834
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,639
uh committee where we had a night where

835
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,879
you know we had different cultures and

836
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,159
um an event where we we brought food and

837
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,159
you know we share different cultures and

838
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,079
traditions. That's just one example. We

839
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,520
also have another event where we

840
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,440
actually get together every week to

841
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,359
share our life stories in a very

842
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,359
intimate setting. So that's how we kind

843
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,640
of build bond with each other and it

844
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,640
doesn't matter like where you're from,

845
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,079
what what have you experienc what kind

846
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,760
of experiences you you've been through

847
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,320
because you will realize that everyone

848
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,960
brings um you know their own unique set

849
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,960
of lens and experiences to the table.

850
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Yeah,

851
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,079
>> thank you um for answering these

852
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:30,000
questions. We're going to transition

853
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:32,320
into the live Q&A uh portion of this

854
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,920
session. So I'm just going to very

855
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,560
similarly I'm going to ask the question

856
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,040
and then our panelists can um answer

857
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,400
them as they choose. So the first

858
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,119
question here um is as a first

859
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,440
generation student I find myself coming

860
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,680
across a lot of surprises. What would

861
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,079
you recommend I do before starting an

862
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:56,839
MBA program to limit the untold

863
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,839
distractions when starting my program?

864
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,560
It's it's a it's a good question. I

865
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,119
think it's it's difficult and I say this

866
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,240
because I was definitely the person in

867
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:19,040
the MBA program who kind of came in and

868
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,040
came in without doing much preparation

869
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,560
and then was in at the same time was

870
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,040
interested in everything and wanted to

871
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,720
try like all the different kinds of

872
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,000
classes ranging from you know like what

873
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,680
we talked about before like I want to do

874
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,960
entrepreneurship but also I'm interested

875
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,920
in some of this like enterprise

876
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,119
management stuff and I'm interested in

877
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,960
you know all kinds of different things

878
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,440
that I wanted to try. Um, so there was

879
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,599
definitely a lot of like I don't want to

880
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,160
say not necessarily distractions but

881
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,280
just a lot of different interests. What

882
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,800
I think does help maybe and what I would

883
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,560
do differently coming in is

884
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,079
maybe like thinking ahead every

885
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,400
semester. Okay, so what are like my top

886
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,560
three to four kind of goals for this

887
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,640
semester, right? And that could be

888
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,599
something like you know I want to build

889
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,280
like community in this type of way or I

890
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,880
really want to like land this internship

891
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,280
or I really want to learn about this

892
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,359
specific area or like this specific kind

893
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,839
of thing that fascinates me or I want to

894
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:20,079
you know so setting some goals is good

895
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,079
and helpful and I think that gives you

896
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,839
some direction because you come into the

897
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,440
program and there's a million things

898
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,880
that are happening right from the

899
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,480
classes that you can choose the people

900
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,160
that you can meet the clubs that you can

901
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,079
participate in the events there's so

902
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,160
much, right? So, trying to figure out

903
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,640
like how you navigate that, it helps to

904
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:41,040
to set some personal goals. But I think

905
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,720
it also helps to be a little bit like

906
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,079
open-minded in a sense of like, okay,

907
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,240
not just like I'm going to follow these

908
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,400
goals and that's it. Like leave a little

909
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,760
bit of space for exploration of like

910
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,079
things that may surprise you and that

911
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,480
you may find. So like I think I think

912
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,119
that that combination of mostly goals

913
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,400
and some openness for new things would

914
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,800
have helped me maybe come in a little

915
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,800
bit more focused.

916
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,800
Yeah.

917
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,359
Um just to get through a few more of

918
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,520
these questions. how we're going to move

919
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,520
forward is I'll ask uh one of the

920
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,119
questions and then we'll have one of the

921
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,800
panelists answer and then we'll just

922
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,119
jump into the next question just so we

923
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,880
can um get more of the questions going.

924
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,440
Um so this next question here is um

925
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,200
Olivia a guest can um is asking can you

926
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,359
talk about the specific opportunities

927
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,359
that you had to gain exposure to for

928
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:36,359
tech careers and opportunities on

929
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:36,359
campus?

930
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,720
I guess this should be me. I don't know

931
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,119
if um Andreas or Yeah, I guess. Um I

932
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,000
think for specifically for tech careers,

933
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,079
it's pretty great honestly. Um product

934
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,200
management club and technology club were

935
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,640
really helpful. Um I think also um

936
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,160
career office um at Sloan does help. So

937
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,760
like meeting with them early, talking

938
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,520
about your goals and and things you want

939
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,440
to do and them directing you to the

940
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,920
right resources that helps a lot.

941
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,920
There's a lot of I think alumni and

942
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,079
secondyear students that have already

943
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,920
for example you know maybe landed

944
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,520
internships or jobs at the places where

945
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:21,280
you want to go. Um so talking to them

946
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,880
helps um as well and uh and there's also

947
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,560
just like recruiting events on campus

948
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,520
there at least used to be in 2023 I

949
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,400
think probably still now. So, um there's

950
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,440
kind of like these like organized like

951
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,200
recruiting events, info sessions, um in

952
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,440
sort of like one-on-one or interviews or

953
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,520
group chats with different alumni. Uh

954
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,760
these companies do want to recruit Sloan

955
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,359
students. So, that definitely does help.

956
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,839
So, you can just kind of like plug

957
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,200
yourself into some of those systems. Um

958
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,440
just making sure that you do it early

959
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,240
on. And I think that's like like sort of

960
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,480
big tech especially uh comes in pretty

961
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,320
early like first semester and like early

962
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,760
second semester and then some of the

963
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,280
more kind of like startup stuff is like

964
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,560
throughout throughout the first and

965
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,560
second year. Um so yeah,

966
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,079
>> thank you Dana. Um so I'm actually going

967
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,599
to mash these next two questions because

968
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,240
I think they're very similar. Um but

969
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,440
the MBA involves quite a lot of travel

970
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,200
networking networking. Um, and so when

971
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,119
you think about how to budget or

972
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,400
finance, how do you structure your

973
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,359
financing plan? Um, and how does it um

974
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,800
how does this impact or come from what

975
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,160
is it like coming from a lowinccome

976
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,160
background financing these sort of

977
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,160
things?

978
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:45,760
Um, I think kind of like similar to what

979
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,760
I was um alluding to earlier that

980
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,280
like my like the budget plan that that I

981
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,200
did was kind of being a little strategic

982
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,960
and knowing from the get-go that I would

983
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,800
have I would allocate from the beginning

984
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,160
like a set amount for all these trips

985
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,359
and like all these uh events and kind of

986
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:07,200
like that's that's my budget And

987
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:09,520
really, I kind of frontloaded it because

988
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,359
I knew that just kind of coming in the

989
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,119
into the first year, get get as many of

990
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,920
these experiences in to like meet as

991
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,000
many people as possible and kind of and

992
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,240
the second year spending it a little

993
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,319
more kind of in the in the Cambridge

994
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,040
area events and that kind of stuff. and

995
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:29,920
and I think that's that's kind of like

996
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,280
the approach that I took uh with like

997
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,359
with the resources that I had at the

998
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,760
moment, the loans and scholarship and

999
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:39,200
savings combination of all the all the

1000
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,599
above. And I think it's

1001
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,960
it's uh it's a relatively common

1002
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,400
approach. I'd say I found that a lot of

1003
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,200
people I found that a lot of people in

1004
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,000
my year kind of were feeling the same

1005
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,280
way that I did and that there's a lot of

1006
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,119
there's a lot of things happening and

1007
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,280
you want to do all and you want to do

1008
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,800
all of it and ends up being that the

1009
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,240
first year you end up doing as much as

1010
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,480
you can and and then second year kind of

1011
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,400
becomes like this uh fostering

1012
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,240
relationship relationship that you've

1013
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,400
found and people that you met over the

1014
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,560
first year and I think that's kind of

1015
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,560
how I handled it just kind of very being

1016
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,240
a little bit strict on like what my

1017
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,680
spending would be for the first year and

1018
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:21,040
then setting that that budget up front

1019
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,760
and trying my best to manage that, I

1020
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,640
guess. But being I guess like being

1021
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,200
clear and honest with what you are

1022
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,280
actually willing to to do and take and

1023
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,280
and what you will be getting out of the

1024
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,280
events.

1025
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,400
>> Thank you, Andres. Um this second

1026
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,520
question I do want to bounce to um

1027
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,800
Janisha and also one other MBA student.

1028
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:50,240
Um so this question is um if at all how

1029
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,920
does the overall MBA or SFMBA experience

1030
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,480
differ as a FGLI student um for those

1031
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,960
compared to for those who do notident

1032
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,319
compared to those who do not identify as

1033
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,680
a FGLI student and does our background

1034
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:09,119
affect much when socializing in general?

1035
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,520
So Janisha, I'll have you start.

1036
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,280
>> So um I think this goes back to one of

1037
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:18,480
the questions you've asked earlier about

1038
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:20,800
con building confidence. Um so I I'd

1039
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,440
like to iterate again that you know it's

1040
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,359
always good to understand the value that

1041
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,920
you're bringing to the table. It's not

1042
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:31,520
always measured in like economic terms.

1043
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,680
So I think uh for me what helped was um

1044
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,160
to start with leadership classes earlier

1045
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,640
in the program. So for the Stone Fellows

1046
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,960
program, you actually do get um I would

1047
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,359
say a full term of leadership classes

1048
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,720
paired with an executive coach. So this

1049
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,800
is where you can work through some of

1050
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:50,560
your li self-limiting beliefs about you

1051
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,119
know being um you know FGLI

1052
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:55,520
um and and basically seeing the world

1053
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:59,040
differently as the what you can bring

1054
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:01,839
from your unique experiences. Um and I

1055
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,760
think the second point about you know

1056
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,640
what Andrea's actually Andreas actually

1057
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,319
mentioned again um there are certainly

1058
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,000
some events where you might feel

1059
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,079
excluded from just because of the cost

1060
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,400
of the event right like for instance if

1061
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,319
you're going skiing in Colorado you

1062
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,640
might not want to sp like splurge

1063
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,319
splurge on that trip alone. So that's

1064
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,680
where you can you you can actually ask

1065
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,880
yourself like do you want really want to

1066
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,640
go on that trip or can you actually

1067
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,880
organize somewhere that's nearer for

1068
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,920
instance uh with a smaller group of

1069
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,440
friends you see. So you can always it's

1070
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,720
instead of like following what others

1071
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,280
are doing you can always initiate your

1072
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,720
own events as well. So I would say but

1073
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,480
the biggest part for me again I think

1074
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,079
back to what I just mentioned earlier on

1075
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,079
is working through the self-limiting

1076
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,920
beliefs right and understanding the

1077
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,920
value that you're bringing to the table.

1078
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,920
Yeah.

1079
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:50,760
>> Thank you, Janisha.

1080
00:44:52,800 --> 00:45:00,599
Anyone else like to answer this question

1081
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,599
as an MBA student full-time?

1082
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,960
>> Uh, I can I can talk a little bit about

1083
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:12,079
uh that. I mean, I think I think for for

1084
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:14,640
me, um, the education aspect of it was

1085
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,119
kind of like

1086
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,640
it was tough at times to deal with that.

1087
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:24,160
Um, it, if I'm being honest, it did feel

1088
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:26,000
it did feel at times that that there

1089
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,480
there was a lot of people that had all

1090
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,440
this knowledge and kind of like had all

1091
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:35,200
these this certain kind of like

1092
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,119
understanding of how industries work. or

1093
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:41,599
how like certain recruiting practices

1094
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:46,000
work. And I and I came in pretty I guess

1095
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:48,560
unprepared for that. Uh and

1096
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,200
and uh it was kind of like tough to me

1097
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,960
not to not kind of go to go to my get

1098
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,319
into my head and be like, oh because

1099
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,000
these are things that people like would

1100
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,880
normally talk about during a dinner

1101
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,280
dinner dinner dinner time conversation

1102
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,839
and I never have those conversations.

1103
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,119
But but going back to like what I was

1104
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:06,960
saying that everybody But everybody is

1105
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:10,640
very open about their experiences. So

1106
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,359
it's uh kind of acknowledging that these

1107
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:16,880
different experiences that everybody has

1108
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:18,079
and and and

1109
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,359
some of the leadership classes

1110
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,800
definitely like help on like building

1111
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:23,839
the confidence to ask the right

1112
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,359
questions and and everybody and nobody

1113
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,960
will I will tell tell you no in that

1114
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,880
regard that everybody's open and will

1115
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,520
kind of like talk talk to you and teach

1116
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:35,040
you and and knowledge share in a way

1117
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:39,119
that is uh that is honest and and

1118
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,800
humble. Um, but it but kind of like

1119
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,240
getting over that hump of of like we're

1120
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,760
all here to learn. We're all here in a

1121
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,760
community to support each other and we

1122
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,040
all bring different values. I think that

1123
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,640
was like something that I struggled with

1124
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:52,000
at the beginning, but over time kind of

1125
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,680
got better at at at acknowledging that

1126
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,640
that we do all bring different values to

1127
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:00,560
the table and that sure I might not know

1128
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,240
I I might not know how different uh

1129
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,640
corners of the financial industry work

1130
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,400
over or have evolved over time, but uh

1131
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,920
but there's other things that I bring to

1132
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,079
and we can talk about those things and

1133
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:16,839
the community itself, I think it's what

1134
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,839
like helped me get over up.

1135
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,040
>> Thank you, Andres. And so this last

1136
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:26,480
question here I will have open um to all

1137
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:29,359
of our panelists. Um and we will be um

1138
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:32,400
this is our last question. So um the

1139
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:35,280
question is what are some examples of

1140
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,960
activities organized by the fly club and

1141
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,560
how does it differ from other clubs

1142
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,839
given that that many of them seem to

1143
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,839
have very similar events and activities?

1144
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,079
I'll talk quickly about just like um in

1145
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:56,720
my experience I think in like yeah when

1146
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:59,520
when we were um like 2022 2023 I think

1147
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,839
the biggest differentiator of fly club

1148
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:05,359
events versus like other events that I

1149
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:07,920
had I think were that fly club or FGLI I

1150
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:10,880
think now um they're more focused I

1151
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,560
think on building community I think you

1152
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:14,480
will have a a lot of like different

1153
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,160
types of events for example um during

1154
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,520
the MBA. So you'll have more like career

1155
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,160
focused events. You'll have just like

1156
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:22,000
fun party stuff that like friends do

1157
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:25,680
which is also like totally fine and

1158
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,640
totally great to do but I think the fly

1159
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,960
events were more kind of like bringing

1160
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,640
us all together kind of acknowledging

1161
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,160
some of these things that I think both

1162
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,680
Andreas and Janisha were talking about

1163
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,520
earlier that we do have different

1164
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,319
experience that often times we come in

1165
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:43,599
and we are like what is going on? I did

1166
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,280
not know what an MBA is before I started

1167
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,440
thinking about applying for an MBA,

1168
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,119
right? And some of our, you know,

1169
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,119
colleagues or some of our like

1170
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,480
classmates that are also like just

1171
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,240
really awesome, they knew that they were

1172
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,839
going to do an MBA like 5 years ago,

1173
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,160
right? And were fully prepared. And

1174
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,160
that's awesome to have someone who's had

1175
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,760
that experience, right? Like I think

1176
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,480
bringing us together, acknowledging that

1177
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,160
like yeah, we maybe face a particular

1178
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,920
experience and we all share that

1179
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,000
experience and like how can we help each

1180
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,599
other like navigate through that. That

1181
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,400
was kind of the cornerstone of a lot of

1182
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,240
these events um that we did like kind of

1183
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,480
coming together maybe going to like a

1184
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,559
trip in New England somewhere together

1185
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,559
or like you know having like a Christmas

1186
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:24,240
dinner party or a Thanksgiving dinner

1187
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:27,920
party because like nobody's traveling

1188
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:30,480
outside um of like Boston that year or

1189
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,079
whatever. So I think that was that and

1190
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,480
honestly many of my close friendships

1191
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,319
came out of that group too. Um so that's

1192
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,520
that's one big thing and then really

1193
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:42,079
helping you like navigate that MBA

1194
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:46,040
experience from from that FGLI point of

1195
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,040
view has been really helpful.

1196
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:57,200
>> Does anybody else want to share?

1197
00:49:54,559 --> 00:50:00,400
Yeah, I I mean I guess I guess just like

1198
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,640
I would like to emphasize Draana's point

1199
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:05,359
that like yeah I think it became a it

1200
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,280
became a community where there's like

1201
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:09,599
the mutual understanding of a shared

1202
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,920
background and and that it is

1203
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,119
acknowledged. It kind of it did it did

1204
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,440
feel like it was a place I guess or a

1205
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:19,520
safe safe space in that way that it's

1206
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,200
easy to acknowledge and have tougher

1207
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:24,160
conversations

1208
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:27,920
uh because of a shared experience in a

1209
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:31,119
way. Uh and and same thing like from

1210
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,119
FGLI I I there's friends that I still

1211
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,480
keep in touch with and like that I kind

1212
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,280
of became friends with like through the

1213
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:40,000
program and like became

1214
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,160
uh great people to bounce off ideas and

1215
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,359
just kind of

1216
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:47,200
put my perspect put my experience into a

1217
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:50,480
larger perspective of like what what's

1218
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,480
going on around me because it is a
