Hello and welcome to the uh MIT ethics

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,960
of computing research symposium. Um so

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,799
you're about to see a bunch of talks

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,640
today. The sort of um smallest thing

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,800
they have in common is that they're all

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,480
reporting on research funded by CIRC,

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,720
the social ethical responsibilities for

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,480
computing initiative within the college.

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,599
um uh what what there's something large

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,359
they have in common um uh at CIRC what

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,199
happened is last year we had a call

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,040
initiated by Georgia Parakus then

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,399
associate dean of the college who um uh

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,559
we called out for across MIT for

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,719
researchers we could support who were

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,320
doing work in this area the social and

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,640
ethical responsibilities of computing

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,960
and we had 67 applications and uh we

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,719
from every school at the institute and

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,039
we convened a committee

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,640
um of reviewers with representatives

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,879
from every school at the institute to

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,480
select the best ones. So what you're

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,159
seeing here is kind of a collective

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,799
community judgment about what the most

26
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,320
exciting work in when it comes to

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,760
research in the social and ethical

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,439
responsibilities of computing being done

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,240
at MIT is so um I hope that you'll be as

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,640
excited about it all as we are. Uh so

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,640
