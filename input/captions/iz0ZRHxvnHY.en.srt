1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,840
So um I would like to uh take the work

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,199
the ideas that Rob just described and

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,680
look at the fundamental atomic um

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,080
processes that underpin these and other

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,880
types of reactions that allow us to

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,840
develop new kinds of materials. So we

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,480
we've we've seen extensively in Rob's

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,719
talk how structure dictates properties

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,280
and I took this text actually from his

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,160
abstract. Um it's very clear that the

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,760
way the atoms are arranged in a material

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,079
determine all of the important

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,800
properties the mechanical properties the

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,520
electronic and magnetic properties um

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,559
the properties in functional uh

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,480
situations like catalysis. And so um

17
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,719
every important characteristic really

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,920
fundamentally goes back to how the atoms

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,359
are arranged within the material. Now if

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,680
you want to see how the atoms are

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,479
arranged truly rather than showing

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,240
PowerPoint drawings with colored shapes

23
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,640
on them, then you're going to use

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,680
electron microscopy because this is the

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,640
only technique that has a combination of

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,280
spatial resolution and chemical ability

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,560
to determine which which blob is which

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,840
kind of atom. And um this is an example

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,159
of a high resolution electron microraph

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,159
of a layered material. So you all know

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,880
about graphine and its relatives where

32
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,360
the atoms are arranged in layers. Um

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,479
this is a view looking along the layers

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,119
of a 2D antifromagnet

35
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,040
um where we can identify exactly which

36
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,400
atom is where in the structure. So

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,400
obviously we look in three different

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,560
directions we'll see exactly where all

39
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,520
the atoms are. So these kinds of images

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,439
are really amazing in showing us where

41
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,240
the atoms are and therefore helping us

42
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,960
get some kind of intuition into how the

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,360
material will behave. However, um

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,119
structure of materials is constantly

45
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,680
changing. Imagine that we are uh we have

46
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,759
designed a material uh with a specific

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,160
structure and then we ask it to do a job

48
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,319
like perform a catalysis uh reaction um

49
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,800
be an electrode in a battery as we

50
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,040
charge and discharge it. Um as these

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,120
materials do their jobs the structure is

52
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,280
going to change. As materials are

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,319
exposed to the environment they oxidize,

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,360
they corrode. Um they may absorb carbon

55
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,879
dioxide. They may be exposed to a really

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,560
uh unfriendly environment such as the uh

57
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,720
they could be the wall of a nuclear

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,720
reactor or they could be a pipeline for

59
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,800
oil and gas. So these are these are very

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,840
unfriendly reaction uh environments that

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,760
will change the uh structure and hence

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,840
the properties of the material. And

63
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,920
finally as we actually process materials

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,280
to make them into the structures we want

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,080
clearly the structure is going to

66
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,360
change. So it's more likely that things

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,440
change than that they stay the same. So

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,920
the idea of taking static pictures in

69
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,319
the electron microscope is somewhat

70
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,760
limited. What we truly need to do is

71
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,080
record movies during reaction conditions

72
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,040
where we can see what the atoms are

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,720
actually doing. So these two um are

74
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,720
series of stills um of uh some some

75
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,120
different materials reactions. The first

76
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,440
one growth of germanmanium on silicon.

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,159
Uh the second one is a battery electrode

78
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,319
effectively during uh cycling uh where

79
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,319
you can see the initiation of dendritic

80
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,640
structures. You know how bad those are

81
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,799
for battery performance. So these are

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,760
stills this is a real-time movie of a

83
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,440
catalyst under its reaction conditions.

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,440
So we don't just want to take pictures.

85
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,239
We want to record movies and we want to

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,680
expose our sample to the correct um

87
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,760
conditions that will allow us to

88
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,239
replicate real life and understand

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,680
what's going on. So uh how do we do

90
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,760
this? The technique is called

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,159
environmental transmission electron

92
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,480
microscopy. So environmental simply

93
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,439
means that we put the sample into an

94
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,200
environment that we control rather than

95
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,360
the environment that the microscope

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,599
manufacturer chose for us which is a

97
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,599
vacuum so that when the electrons pass

98
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,680
through the microscope they don't

99
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,080
scatter off any gas molecules during

100
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,479
their passage. So an environmental

101
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,560
transmission electron microscope can

102
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,320
take many forms depending on the type of

103
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,960
experiment you want to do. And I'm

104
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,120
showing you our original environmental

105
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,440
transmission electron microscope, which

106
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,720
is really a case where the microscope is

107
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,960
a tiny part of a huge system that allows

108
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,720
us to do complex experiments. So the

109
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,199
microscope is just this little piece

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,919
here, right? So that that's where the

111
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,639
the electrons come out of a gun up here.

112
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,880
They get accelerated to 300,000 volts.

113
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,479
That gives them very short wavelengths

114
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,479
that allows them to resolve where the

115
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,320
atoms are in the material. They pass

116
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,680
through some lenses. Uh there's a

117
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,520
viewing screen. This is an old

118
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,160
microscope. You could look at it with

119
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,000
your sit at it and look down onto the

120
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,240
screen and see what's going on. The

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,360
signal gets sent to a computer hidden

122
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,759
away behind here. But this microscope is

123
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,759
really part of a huge materials

124
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,720
preparation, cleaning, synthesis,

125
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,880
calibration uh setup where we can insert

126
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,039
a sample which is mounted on a cartridge

127
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,440
like this. The sample is a tiny little

128
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,759
chip. Uh typically has to be thin. So

129
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,840
the electrons will go through it. Um and

130
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,840
it's placed on the cartridge. The

131
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,759
cartridge is loaded into the load lock.

132
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,160
Uh the load lock is connected to a load

133
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,600
of other places all under controlled

134
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,080
vacuum so that you can um process your

135
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,160
sample without it getting uh random

136
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,840
contamination from the air. and then

137
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,240
when you're ready, put it in the

138
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,520
microscope and then record a movie as

139
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,320
you flow a gas or deposit a material or

140
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,039
heat it up or flow a current through

141
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,880
your sample. So, a very flexible tool

142
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,919
for doing a whole lot of different

143
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,759
experiments. Um, I show I I wanted to

144
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,080
show you that older microscope because

145
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,160
the modern microscopes look a lot less

146
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,960
interesting, right? They're hidden in a

147
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,960
box. All the good stuff is inside the

148
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,160
box. This one's open so you can see the

149
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,800
microscope but um here you can see the

150
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,199
little bit of extra stuff that we added

151
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,199
um so that we can do preparation. So

152
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,520
these are based on modernday uh static

153
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,560
electron microscopes but with this

154
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,720
addition of capabilities that you can do

155
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,199
to modify your sample while you watch

156
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,520
it. Um and I have to say that electron

157
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,319
microscopy is a joy to work in because

158
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,440
the field is advancing uh in all

159
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,680
respects. Uh the imaging performance

160
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,680
gets better, the way we can handle the

161
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,639
data, the types of processing, the

162
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:47,680
detectors are improving, the stability,

163
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:50,319
a lot of um of uh use of of of um AI

164
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,080
type tools to improve what we can do so

165
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,479
that you're no longer limited, for

166
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,319
example, by how good the operator is.

167
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,240
you can have the microscope kind of run

168
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,440
itself. Right? So that's the kind of

169
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,520
preamble to what we wanted to do. And

170
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,599
now I'd like to show you some examples

171
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,520
uh from the real world that hopefully

172
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,680
give you a sense of what sorts of things

173
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,280
we problems we can address using this

174
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,440
techniques. And I want to start with

175
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,680
catalysis because this is really one of

176
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,479
those fun things where it's very clear

177
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,319
that what you think about catalysts

178
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,960
doesn't reflect what they're actually

179
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,400
doing while they are working uh at their

180
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,319
job. So this is platinum on carbon. The

181
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,800
platinum shows up as the little white

182
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,240
dots, the carbon as the kind of fuzzy

183
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,720
gray background. And as you uh probably

184
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,000
uh know, this is very this is kind of a

185
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,400
model catalyst system. The um the

186
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,240
catalytic converter in your car will

187
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,319
fundamentally have the same structure.

188
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,199
There'll be some little metal nano

189
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,599
particles just consisting of a few maybe

190
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,120
thousand of metal atoms. they'll be

191
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,360
supported on some kind of a a support

192
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,360
and as the gas flows over those

193
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,919
particles, they will um change the the

194
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,160
um energy balance of reactions that take

195
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,960
that you'd like to take place uh and

196
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,840
thereby for example uh take the CO out

197
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,080
of your exhaust stream. So um here's an

198
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,840
example of one of these prototypical

199
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,360
catalysts and what you can see in the

200
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,120
movie. Well firstly there's there's

201
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,039
three pictures there's two pictures

202
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,759
recorded simultaneously. So the

203
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,680
microscope is able to show us the image

204
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,360
that the movie that's recorded by

205
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,759
electrons that pass right through the

206
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,159
sample. So in that case you can imagine

207
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,800
platinum's very heavy carbon's pretty

208
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,959
light. um the electrons when they hit a

209
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,039
platinum particle, they're going to get

210
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,680
scattered a lot more than if they merely

211
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,519
hit some carbon. So the platinum in

212
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,480
these images shows up as the bright

213
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,240
spots and the carbon as the dark. You

214
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,880
can hardly see it in fact against the

215
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,000
background. This image though, the last

216
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,320
image is a surface sensitive image that

217
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,160
is recorded by looking at the electrons

218
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,480
that come off the surface of the sample,

219
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,640
low energy electrons. So effectively

220
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,959
scanning electron microscopy. So it's

221
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,279
sensitive to the surface rather than

222
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,800
what goes on inside. And you can see the

223
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,880
complimementaryary information that

224
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,839
comes out of this stuff. So looking

225
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,920
inside, we see the particles move around

226
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,080
during catalysis. They move. They're

227
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,320
energetic. There's a lot of temperature.

228
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,080
There's there's energy going around. The

229
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,080
particles simply move around. When two

230
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,560
of them collide, they make a larger

231
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,080
particle. The surface area decreases.

232
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,080
The catalyst loses its power because it

233
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,839
depends on surface energy. And that's

234
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,160
why you get the annoying light in the

235
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,240
car that says replace the catalytic

236
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,480
converter. And that's a a lot of money

237
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,399
to do that. And that's this is why you

238
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,880
have to do that, right? But what you can

239
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,600
see from this movie is that not it's not

240
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,920
just the surface is not merely a passive

241
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,440
place for those particles to sit. You

242
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,519
can see, especially in this one, I love

243
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,760
it. Um the particles actually digging

244
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,000
itself a little channel. the platinum's

245
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,560
reacting with the carbon support under

246
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,760
the reaction conditions and is actually

247
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,680
uh degrading catalyzing the degradation

248
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,600
of the support. So what can we learn

249
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,600
from this kind of thing? You can't tell

250
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,080
how something's going to behave if you

251
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,839
simply look at it before and after. You

252
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,000
have to really see what's going on

253
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,399
during the reaction in order to fully

254
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,200
understand the important uh phenomena

255
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,360
that are at play in in the process you

256
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,399
want to optimize.

257
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,200
Let me show you a more complex catalytic

258
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,920
particle because after all if you had to

259
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,560
use pure platinum things would be

260
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,519
extremely expensive. So it's a very

261
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,920
common strategy to um to cut the

262
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,959
platinum with some other lowerc cost

263
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,760
material. And so here's an example uh of

264
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,560
such a a bi metallic catalyst. This one

265
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,600
happens to be a mixture of ruinium and

266
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,560
iron. So we have a kind of lowcost iron

267
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,200
that works with a higher cost runium in

268
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,959
order to catalyze um reverse water gas

269
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,040
shift reaction and you can see

270
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,279
conventional microscopy of these

271
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,120
particles can tell us which atom is

272
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,680
where and how they arranged

273
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,040
crystalraphically within the particles.

274
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,360
But let's do some environmental electron

275
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,959
microscopy. When we first form these

276
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,120
particles, they're formed in a solution

277
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,680
phase. They they form as these beautiful

278
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,279
core shell particles and this is just

279
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,079
because of the kinetics of how they

280
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,920
form. The runium precipitates first in

281
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,920
the solution then the iron around the

282
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,839
outside. So the first thing you do with

283
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,399
these particles after you've made them

284
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,200
is you oxidize them and then you start

285
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,680
to use them for catalysis. Um this is

286
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,399
the first oxidation step and you can see

287
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,480
the dramatic change in the morphology

288
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,800
and the composition of the particles.

289
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,720
They start with the ruthenium core and

290
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,800
these are the transmitted images. You

291
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,959
see the core is becoming kind of

292
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,000
confused and eventually there's no

293
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,560
apparent core left. The ruthenium is

294
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,160
scattered throughout the oxidized iron

295
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,079
and you can see from the surface

296
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,160
sensitive images how the particles

297
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,800
they've actually centered together and

298
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,120
we've got faceting on the surface. So

299
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,680
this is like step one of making these

300
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,920
catalytic particles. And let's see what

301
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,720
happens now when we use them as

302
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,720
catalysts. Um we're effectively

303
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,959
oxidizing and reducing them under the

304
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,560
catalytic conditions. And what you can

305
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,639
see is a dramatic change in the uh

306
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,279
structure and the chemical like

307
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,480
distribution of the elements. So after

308
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,240
you oxidize sorry after you reduce them

309
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,800
expose them to hydrogen in the

310
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,440
microscope we see the formation of

311
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,120
little particles. Um our surface

312
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,519
sensitive imaging tells us those are

313
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,600
actually on the top surface not inside.

314
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,680
Uh compositional mapping tells them that

315
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,880
tells us that they're made of ruthenium.

316
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,760
Um so reduction creates this this type

317
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,680
of morphology. Oxidation turns it back

318
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,079
into the more uniform thing that I

319
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,000
showed you before. And we can correlate

320
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,959
these structural changes with the

321
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,720
composite with the performance of these

322
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:07,839
particles when in their catalytic job.

323
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,880
So we can truly relate the atomic

324
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,000
positions and configurations

325
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,880
w to the um to the properties of the

326
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,639
material and we can we can thereby gain

327
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,200
information about what does it take for

328
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:25,440
example to regenerate the catalysts.

329
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,399
Given time they um lose their catalytic

330
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,800
ability. a reduction oxidation cycle

331
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,519
will regenerate the performance of the

332
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,440
catalyst which is due to the uh presence

333
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,600
of these little particles on the

334
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,440
surface. So catalysis is one of those

335
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,040
fields where you really need to know

336
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,120
where the atoms are in order to

337
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,959
understand what's going on and not just

338
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,120
where they are but where they are during

339
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,959
the catalytic reaction. Now I want to

340
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,959
switch gears to micro electronics

341
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,880
because this is another area where I

342
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,760
feel that there's a lot to contribute

343
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,959
from understanding how atoms move around

344
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:02,160
during both processing and operation of

345
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,959
micro electronic devices. So as you know

346
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,199
uh a lot of energy in modern micro

347
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,839
electronics design is to do with

348
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,160
integrating new materials that maybe

349
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,880
have better performance than the

350
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,519
conventional silicon and silicon dioxide

351
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,639
as the semiconductor and the dialectric

352
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:24,079
material. Um and so you could replace

353
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,959
the dialectric with more useful oxides

354
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,839
like halfneium oxide. Um you could

355
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,320
replace the semiconductor silicon with

356
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,320
some of the new 2D layered

357
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,480
semiconductors like for example

358
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,839
malibdinum dulfide a perfectly good

359
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,959
semiconductor that forms as layers and

360
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,199
thereby naturally is kind of suited for

361
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,480
making very thin sheets of

362
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:51,199
semiconducting material. So you still

363
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,360
need now you know the whole momentum of

364
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,240
the micro electronics industry over many

365
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,720
decades has been how do we optimize

366
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,360
siliconbased micro electronics. So we're

367
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,440
not simply going to say oh this material

368
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,440
performs better in this little respect.

369
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,240
Let's just switch everything over. You

370
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,560
have to uh work out manufacturable ways

371
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,800
to do all of the processing steps that

372
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,600
would be required if we were to use that

373
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,600
one material. So as an example in the

374
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,519
case of malibdinum dulfide it's a

375
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,360
semiconductor we need to make a good

376
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:26,240
junction between it and an insulating

377
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,320
layer to use it in electronic devices

378
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,720
and one way to do that is to try and

379
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,360
oxidize it. This is how we make the

380
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,199
silicon oxide uh dialectric layer that's

381
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:40,800
used in in in micro electronics. Um and

382
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:43,440
so we can use the uh insitue microscope

383
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,320
to examine things like the oxidation of

384
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:50,000
these layered materials and work out the

385
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,120
conditions where you get useful or uh or

386
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,639
useless types of oxide. And this this I

387
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,199
put it in because it's beautiful. But

388
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,040
this is the worst possible uh

389
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,279
configuration because you can see the

390
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,959
oxide is these little lines, right? you

391
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,199
want a uniform layer of oxide but

392
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,040
instead we get these little needles and

393
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,120
we can understand why they form by

394
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,399
seeing the atomic motions that create

395
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,480
them. We can also operate our electronic

396
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,480
devices. Uh you can pass a current

397
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,839
through a neuromorphic material and you

398
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,320
can look at the way that the

399
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,560
conductivity of that material changes to

400
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,720
give it its uh specific types of

401
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,920
properties. um and those changes in

402
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,920
conductivity are associated with atomic

403
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,000
configuration changes such as

404
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,120
crystallization. So I don't want to talk

405
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,120
about those two things in any depth. Um

406
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,800
I because I' I'd like to give a more of

407
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,360
a sense of the breadth of um this this

408
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,199
concept of relating structure to

409
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,839
properties using environmental

410
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,680
microscopy. Um this slide shows some

411
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,920
contact materials for future micro

412
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,880
electronics. you got to get the current

413
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,120
in and out of the device. Um, in

414
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,720
conventional micro electronics, we use

415
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,000
gold as the conductor. Um, and we maybe

416
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,079
use a titanium layer to glue the gold

417
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,360
onto whatever material it's supposed to

418
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,600
be sending the electrons uh into. Um,

419
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,199
this is an example of a gold and

420
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,199
titanium uh billayer grown on graphine.

421
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,959
Uh, we need to make these electrical

422
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,319
connections with 2D materials like

423
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,520
graphine. uh we can explore how titanium

424
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,520
and gold deposit on graphine in this

425
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,679
case in a beautiful epitaxial

426
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,480
arrangement where each of the three

427
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,559
layers the graphine the titanium and the

428
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,160
gold is perfectly crystalline and all

429
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,720
those crystals are aligned with each

430
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,320
other that's how um the microscopist

431
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,160
look at that and say oh yeah I see that

432
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,400
contrast that means all the atoms are

433
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,559
aligned I do a diffraction pattern I see

434
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,720
the same thing um you can explore how

435
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,480
this depends on the deposition

436
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,559
conditions And you can explore things

437
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,679
like the thermal stability. We obviously

438
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,480
need our contacts to stay unchanged even

439
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,799
if the device gets a little bit hot. Um

440
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,360
this is a contact material for one of

441
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,520
these 2D semiconductors. U and you can

442
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,120
see the beautiful atomic structure of

443
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,960
bismouth on MOS2. uh in in the in the

444
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,400
images

445
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,799
we can um also look at ways to create

446
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,840
the actual structures that are used

447
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:23,120
within the microeleronic devices. So I'm

448
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,600
showing you here a video of a nanowire

449
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,679
being grown using a catalytic particle.

450
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,160
So this is one of my favorite reactions

451
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,120
to do in the microscope. Um we would

452
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,280
like to create nanoructures. We

453
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,200
understand that conventional lithography

454
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,039
has limitations. As we try and scale

455
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,600
down and down and down, it gets

456
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:47,200
increasingly difficult to control the um

457
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,440
the the the dimensions, the sidewall

458
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,679
smoothness, the crystallinity, the

459
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,919
perfection of the of the objects that

460
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,480
you're trying to create. So, can we

461
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,200
instead use a self assembly process

462
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,880
where the material spontaneously forms

463
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,120
in the structure that you would like?

464
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,760
And this is exactly the strategy that

465
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,320
Rob showed in his talk to assemble

466
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,880
larger objects uh in this case little

467
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,039
spherical particles into these large

468
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,280
arrays that would have photonic uh

469
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,240
optical properties. So in this case I'm

470
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,799
I'm asking can we assemble silicon atoms

471
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,440
into a little post that we might use for

472
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,160
example for a gate allaround um

473
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,559
transistor. So how would we do that? We

474
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,039
would supply silicon.

475
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,919
We would use a catalyst, this big

476
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:37,840
droplet of liquid, and the catalyst

477
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:40,160
would um would cat would increase the

478
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,760
growth rate of the silicon just at this

479
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,760
place um while not really enhancing the

480
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,160
growth rate on the sides. So everything

481
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,320
that happens happens at the end. Um I'm

482
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,880
going to have to start it off again.

483
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,440
Come on, let's do it. Okay, look really

484
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,679
closely. You see the little jumps,

485
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,640
right? Little jumps on this video. Um,

486
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:04,160
each one of these jumps is one layer of

487
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,440
silicon atoms being added from the vapor

488
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,919
phase through the liquid onto the

489
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,160
surface. And to show it more, I'm going

490
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,120
to show the middle of that movie, the

491
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,440
middle section strip. And look at it.

492
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,039
Nothing happens for a long time. Each

493
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,120
one of those lines is a layer of atoms.

494
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,520
Then suddenly whole layer, right? Forms

495
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,280
all at once. Um and we can look at this

496
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,520
kind of kinetics and we can model the

497
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,360
physics of the process that goes on. The

498
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,520
silicon atoms come down from the gas

499
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,000
phase. They land on the surface of the

500
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,000
liquid drop which is very accommodating

501
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,159
because it's an amorphous liquid. So

502
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,480
they stick very effectively. They

503
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,799
diffuse through the droplet. They get

504
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,960
super saturated. There's too many

505
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,280
silicon atoms dissolved in the liquid.

506
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,440
They got to precipitate somewhere. And

507
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,080
once a few of them precipitate, the rest

508
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,000
of them follow along rapidly within one

509
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,000
movie frame. The whole layer is

510
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,760
complete. And then you have to wait and

511
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,120
refill the droplets. So you get this

512
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,760
kind of kind of uh interrupted growth.

513
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,600
Really interesting. So we can use this

514
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,159
type of knowledge of the physics of this

515
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,799
self assembly process to optimize it. As

516
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,480
an example, we turn off the silicon gas.

517
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,320
We want to turn on some germananium and

518
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,200
then we can make a hetroructure like

519
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,440
this. silicon germanmanium layers in a

520
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,400
sequence with appropriate electronic

521
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,799
properties. So only by watching this

522
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,159
thing happen can you figure out how it

523
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,640
works. Once you finish growth, cool it

524
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,600
down, take it out of the microscope, it

525
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,159
it gets some oxygen, it oxidizes.

526
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,960
There's no chance then of understanding

527
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,880
what truly happens at the interface

528
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,960
during growth. So, we have the real

529
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,000
power of looking into the materials as

530
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,679
they um as they actually grow. Right?

531
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,919
Here's another example of that. Look at

532
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,080
this little jumpy movie. See the little

533
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,240
lines forming? Ignore the big fuzzy

534
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,080
stuff, but see the little lines that

535
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,080
that look like that? If we mag if we

536
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,600
took a tiny bit of that and blew it up,

537
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,559
it would look like this. So, we're

538
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,799
forming hydrides in titanium here, which

539
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,600
is of course a really important um

540
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,360
process in for example um oil and gas

541
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,360
industry. you want to worry about where

542
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,159
does the hydrogen go into in those

543
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:18,159
pipelines. This is a little bit of a

544
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,559
model of how hydrogen uh goes into uh

545
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,039
titanium and rearranges its crystal

546
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,120
structure. And you can see from the from

547
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,760
the um like the kinetics of these

548
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,880
reactions how it something about how it

549
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,600
actually happens. Right?

550
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,320
So, um, I talked a lot about exposing

551
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,480
our samples to gases, heating them up,

552
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,039
passing a current through them, forcing

553
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,360
them to change in some way, but I want

554
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:46,240
to, um, show you a couple of other ways

555
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,159
that we can, uh, create useful, uh,

556
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,240
information using these types of

557
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,320
experiments. And the first example I

558
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,640
want to show you is to do with defect

559
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,640
engineering to create uh, quantum

560
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,919
materials. So this um so the electron

561
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,720
beam is very can be very small. It has

562
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,720
very powerful it's high energy a few

563
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,280
hundred um kilo electron volts are used

564
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,679
to accelerate our electrons and can be

565
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,000
directed to specific locations on the

566
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,720
sample. Now there's very few materials

567
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,799
that are not affected by the electron

568
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:25,600
beam. Uh indeed the environment in terms

569
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,000
of radiation for a te for a sample in a

570
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,480
microscope is worse than being at the

571
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,080
wall of a nuclear reactor. So it's

572
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,320
actually pretty unfriendly and that's

573
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,320
why we often don't do organic things

574
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,120
like what Rob showed you because they

575
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,559
would just get fried completely in a

576
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,960
moment. They would they would just get

577
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,360
destroyed by the electron beam. However,

578
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,600
this can be useful in some context and

579
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,320
this is a an example where we're

580
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,520
creating specific kinds of defects by

581
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,960
placing the electron beam on one column

582
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,520
of atoms in a very well-aligned crystal.

583
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,440
So, the crystal is a another one of

584
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,039
these layered materials. They're so

585
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,200
useful in in many uh respects. Um the

586
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,280
layers are made up of chromium, sulfur,

587
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,840
and bromine. And then in between them is

588
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,720
a little gap, Vanderval's gap. If you

589
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,000
hit the chromium atoms with the electron

590
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,000
beam, they will move. They don't get

591
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,240
thrown out of the crystal. They just

592
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,200
move a little bit sideways, a little bit

593
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,679
down, and they end up in the gap between

594
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,279
the layers. And so this drawing is an

595
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,559
attempt to show that. Here's all the

596
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,799
layers in the crystal. Um, here's where

597
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,960
the electron beam came down. And you can

598
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,440
see these atoms, chromium, got moved to

599
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,919
the space in between the layers. I hope

600
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,640
that makes sense. This is a view, a

601
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:48,320
perspective view. This is the view from

602
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,880
the top after we've done that in all

603
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,039
these locations. So, in each case, we

604
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,799
hit that black I can't even do it. My

605
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,279
hand's not steady enough here. Right,

606
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,200
that black spot is where we hit it with

607
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,440
the electron beam. It's black because

608
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,679
the atoms moved away from that place.

609
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,760
And the adjacent regions are bright

610
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,480
because that's where the atoms went. So

611
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,919
what we've created is a perfectly

612
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,400
engineered defect within this crystal.

613
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,000
These particular defects

614
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,200
have properties very much like the

615
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,960
nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond which

616
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,679
um as you may know is one of the

617
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,200
fundamental building blocks proposed for

618
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:30,320
quantum devices. Those uh are they exist

619
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,159
in um in materials where the electronic

620
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,799
properties are such that if you make a

621
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,320
defect, you've created some additional

622
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,360
energy levels that were not there

623
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,679
before. And you can have uh energy, you

624
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,400
can have electrons jumping between these

625
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:47,279
energy levels and as they change energy

626
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,679
giving out or absorbing photons and use

627
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,880
that photon to communicate with another

628
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:55,039
defect. But in with with

629
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,440
spontaneous defects like the nitrogen

630
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,520
vacancy defect, you have no control over

631
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,279
where they are. You can't put them

632
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,120
specifically close to each other. You

633
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,600
can't make a beautiful array. Using the

634
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,480
electron microscope, you can create

635
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,760
arbitrary arrays rather quickly of

636
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,679
quantum active defects within materials.

637
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,799
And I think the possibilities of this

638
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,440
kind of um of uh material engineering

639
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,120
are really impressive. Um I'm showing a

640
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,039
couple. Do you see the difference?

641
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,200
Right, this one's got like up and down

642
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,799
defects and this one's got left and

643
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,679
right defects just by changing the how

644
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,200
the beam patterns the material and they

645
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,279
have different electronic properties.

646
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,600
You can mix them. You can do do it how

647
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,279
you like. Okay. So, no, I haven't

648
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,760
finished yet. Okay, there's more.

649
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:42,000
There's more. All right. So, so we've

650
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,320
moved from quantum materials to to

651
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,480
batteries. And this is the last example

652
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm going to show uh of one of these

653
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,200
types of experiments. This is charge

654
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,200
discharge of an electrode and it's not a

655
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,600
real battery. It's illustrating the

656
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,159
point because it's my favorite movie. Uh

657
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,120
the electrode is here. Electro is made

658
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:06,960
of graphine. Um the liquid electrolyte

659
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:08,559
is above the um the the um sample and uh

660
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,919
we're looking through the whole thing.

661
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,919
So we can do this liquid by uh we can do

662
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,000
we can do experiments in liquids by

663
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,360
trapping the liquid between two very

664
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,520
thin windows and we can then shine the

665
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,880
electrons through the whole thing and do

666
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,840
this type of of um of uh electrochemical

667
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,799
stimulus that will um that will

668
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,039
replicate what happens in a battery. So

669
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:38,400
I want to conclude with just a couple of

670
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:40,559
quick uh comments. Um materials uh you

671
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,120
know when I started doing microscopy I

672
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,960
thought silicon was my favorite element.

673
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,039
Everything should be just silicon

674
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,279
experiments. What I've learned is that

675
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,679
there are so many different problems out

676
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,640
in the world. Microscopy is developing

677
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:57,200
into a really high performance technique

678
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,960
that can study important reactions. Uh

679
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,039
and just for a little flavor of what I

680
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,039
think will happen in the future, we can

681
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,640
address things like uh the reactions

682
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,520
that take place during cement

683
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,399
processing, hydration and carbonation.

684
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:14,640
Uh trying to understand how to optimize

685
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:17,600
the CO2 like footprint of of uh of

686
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,760
cement reactions. This is an example of

687
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,000
calcium oxide, one of the relevant

688
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,600
materials in the lime cycle created

689
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,039
within the microscope by uh by um

690
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:32,720
heating carbon calcium carbonate um in

691
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,559
in in situ. Um those are the atoms by

692
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,799
the way. Those are the calcium atoms

693
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,360
arranged in their little little cubicle

694
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,720
structure. Beautiful. Um uh oxidation

695
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,679
and reduction of iron. This is

696
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,960
geological hydrogen uh production where

697
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,440
you uh you pass water over ironbearing

698
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,000
minerals and the reduction of the iron

699
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,320
is responsible for creating hydrogen. We

700
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,120
can look at these reactions in situ. And

701
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,799
finally um I didn't really say but it's

702
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,880
obvious these are difficult things to

703
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,960
do. There's a lot of work required for

704
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:07,279
each experiment. throughput is a

705
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,520
challenge and so uh new techniques for

706
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,919
carrying out a lot of little experiments

707
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,840
not in parallel but sequentially can

708
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,640
give us the kind of information we need

709
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,919
to really understand reactions. So I've

710
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,080
shown the work of many colleagues at MIT

711
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,720
and elsewhere. I'd like to acknowledge

712
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,679
what they've all done and thank our

713
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,240
funding agencies. And uh just to

714
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,480
conclude by saying that um we get a

715
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,760
really good insight into what happens

716
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,320
during materials reactions. Uh we can

717
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,840
study a huge range of materials and

718
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,640
processes and we continue to develop um

719
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,120
the instrumental capabilities that will

720
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,600
allow us to make this even more relevant

721
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,360
in the future to a wider range of

722
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,679
materials problems. All right, thanks

723
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,679
for your attention.

724
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,600
Thank you, Francis. Uh, fascinating

725
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,480
pictures of these reaction mechanisms.

726
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,399
Really,

727
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,799
>> any questions? We probably have time for

728
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:07,799
one or two.

729
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,120
>> Yeah, go ahead.

730
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,279
>> Uh, I wonder if you can say more about,

731
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,320
you know, cement production and property

732
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,919
changes or improvement. Um I can't say

733
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,480
too much because this is something that

734
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:27,200
we've started fairly recently. But one

735
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:30,399
thing we can do is we can um we can do

736
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,799
we can um do some of the fundamental

737
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,840
reactions on single component materials.

738
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:38,240
So let's say um calcium carbonate,

739
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,200
calcium oxide, calcium hydroxide. these

740
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:45,520
three materials related by um for

741
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:49,440
example heating in water vapor or CO2 or

742
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:52,399
oxygen. Um you can observe the atomic

743
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,919
level reaction that takes place and some

744
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:56,880
of the important things here are does

745
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,440
the volume change? Does the reaction get

746
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,880
limited by distance as it progresses

747
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,880
into the crystals? This will tell us how

748
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,880
what the mechanisms are and how we can

749
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,840
optimize them. Now real cement of course

750
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,880
has has many components and they tend to

751
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,520
work synergistically together. So the

752
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,799
key thing will be to start with um a

753
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,440
specific component of cement like a and

754
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:24,080
then understand how it reacts with water

755
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,320
or carbon dioxide and then look at if we

756
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,200
combine them how what's the synergy

757
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,200
between the different components. So I I

758
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,039
put this up as a like you know this is

759
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,880
something that I think would be very

760
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:39,039
important in understanding how the final

761
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,279
microructure is a result of the

762
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,200
processing as all these little crystals

763
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,440
form and interlock together to generate

764
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,039
the strain the the the mechanical

765
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,279
properties and then functionalizing

766
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,000
cement for example by putting uh

767
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,880
conductive elements in it and using it

768
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,039
for energy storage. That's a new um

769
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,880
that's a new concept that I think could

770
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,720
benefit from understanding. You know,

771
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,360
you can you can build something and it

772
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,640
works, but if you want to improve it,

773
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,039
you want to see how how the atomic level

774
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,640
um reactions contribute to it. So,

775
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,799
thanks. Great question.

776
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,960
>> Excellent. Let's thank Francis again.

777
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,960
Thank you.
