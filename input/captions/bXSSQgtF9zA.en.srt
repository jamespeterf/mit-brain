>> All right. So, uh this is our first lab

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,519
session for CMS 608. And uh for folks

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,880
who who wasn't here last Wednesday uh

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,080
this past Wednesday.

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
>> So one two

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,640
>> who wasn't

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
>> who was not here on Wednesday.

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,559
>> Yeah. And then you guys So you weren't

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,559
here. Um let's see. We have some blank

18
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,879
index cards underneath the uh the

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,879
plastic Tupperware.

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,039
>> So if you can just fill in your name,

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,399
your email address or favorite board

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,480
game or card game. Uh the email address

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,719
basically just gets added to the email

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,199
list. Um did anyone not get an email

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,640
from Jason this like yesterday?

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,079
>> Yeah, last night

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,640
>> you didn't get an email. I don't think

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,239
so.

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,000
>> Okay. So

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,760
>> uh the email basically said that there

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,720
was a swap

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,240
>> uh of um Friday the 17th

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,840
>> and the 20th. So we're basically

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,680
swapping the readings around. Uh and uh

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,439
that's that's that's really the only

36
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,360
thing, right? Oh, and I fixed the link

37
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,920
for Zimmerman's article.

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,520
>> Yeah. And unfortunately, Eric Zimmerman

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,080
didn't migrate his website terribly

40
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,240
well, so all his pictures are broken.

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,759
This is

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,960
>> a pity. But I actually have one of his

43
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,119
games, uh, Cifi 3000. Um, in fact,

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,640
this is like before CI5 3000. So, the

45
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,479
CIFI 2,999, which is going to be the

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,240
non-digital version, uh, which is the

47
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,600
whole point. Um, it is actually a

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,600
computer game. It's actually a pretty

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,119
decent flash multiplayer game. uh back

50
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,280
in the day when flash multiplayer games

51
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,280
were not that common. And uh if you

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,880
haven't played it before online, uh

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,560
after today, if you especially if you

54
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,799
had a chance to play with the the

55
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,719
cardboard the the card deck, uh try out

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,200
the online version, do a Google search

57
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,479
for 65 3000 and try it online.

58
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,840
Hopefully, you'll be able there are

59
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,360
still people playing it because you need

60
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,080
kind of like a minimum of five people to

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,080
be able to get a good good.

62
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,319
>> Oh, suck. It was such a pretty game.

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,319
Okay, never mind. You know, um it's uh

64
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,160
basically what you had were you got

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,160
avatar customization in the games. You

66
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,120
could create your character and you

67
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,280
could um you had this really cool retro

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,440
pixelated uh look back in the time uh

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,400
back in the day when retro pixelated

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,239
stuff was not that popular yet. Uh but

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,920
uh the gameplay was is pretty much

72
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,440
exactly the same as what a card game

73
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,920
has.

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,560
Okay. Um

75
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,920
the readings today basically uh covered

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,280
a lot of uh jargon uh that we're going

77
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,080
to be going through. We're going to be

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,080
using a lot of that for the rest of the

79
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,360
class. Uh for the most part, I'm not

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,280
going to go through every single one of

81
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,200
them because for the because you folks

82
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,400
can read and if you if we mention

83
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,319
something and you don't get it, you can

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,159
always check back there. So just

85
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,560
remember that that the that first

86
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,640
chapter in breath has is a pretty good

87
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,319
glossery of terminology that we're going

88
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,000
to keep using. Um, but uh, one of the

89
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,640
big things that they ask is what is a

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,239
game? And, uh, it's one of those,

91
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,080
does anyone actually want to offer their

92
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,080
pet definition of what a game is?

93
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:37,200
>> Go for it. A game is something that

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,159
involves uh, players in a set of defined

95
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,959
rules beforehand. rules that you have to

96
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:47,280
abide by whether they be you can't uh go

97
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,720
outside it limits you have to abide by

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,120
certain uh you have to do certain

99
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,159
questions certain orders something that

100
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,519
has structure that is meant for one

101
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:04,640
person to go from point A to point B

102
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,680
>> okay structure rules limits players

103
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,080
anything

104
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,080
>> it's fun.

105
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,760
>> It accomplishes some goal.

106
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,560
>> He always has some kind of goal.

107
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,880
>> Are you working towards something?

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,880
>> Anything else?

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,199
>> Always an abstract system. Often an

110
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,919
abstraction of some system.

111
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,919
>> An abstract system.

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,199
>> Um

113
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,759
so so these these are actually pretty

114
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,000
good uh uh pretty good benchmarks. Now

115
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,720
there there are again as Brenda

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,639
describes there isn't one that's just

117
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,919
the canonical answer for everything. It

118
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,919
really depends on which theorist you're

119
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,080
reading at any given time. Uh but

120
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,000
usually they will involve a significant

121
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,560
subset of all of these uh in the

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,040
definition. Um, and I kind of like to

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,080
keep things broad and vague because for

124
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,560
the most part, um,

125
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,080
by if you if you define yourselves too

126
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,600
strictly, it might be useful if you're

127
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,280
an academic and you need to write papers

128
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,880
about it. But if you're a designer and

129
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,160
you're just trying to create something

130
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,240
fun, uh, or the word I would prefer to

131
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,680
use is engaging because, you know, fun

132
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,680
means a lot of different things to a lot

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,199
of different people. Engaging, you know,

134
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,240
basically means that this is going to be

135
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,120
something that you're going to want to

136
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,360
do for a while. uh that that is

137
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,520
motivating. It might be terrifying you

138
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,160
out of your wits, you know, but some

139
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,840
people enjoy that uh you know or will

140
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,520
find that experience compelling, but

141
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,960
they may not call it fun. Um so so I I

142
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,400
call that engagement. Um the problem

143
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,960
with using fun and engaging as a metric

144
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,680
for defining what a game is is that that

145
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,400
means that a bad game is not a game. uh

146
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,320
a game that fails to achieve fun, that

147
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,120
fails to be engaging, you know, is not a

148
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,280
game. But I will I wouldn't go that far.

149
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,479
Uh largely because that means a lot of

150
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,479
stuff that I've created is not a game.

151
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,840
Um but but you know, it should give you

152
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,520
the the the the you know there is no

153
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,880
magic point where your game becomes

154
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,120
where the thing that you're building

155
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,479
becomes fun and then suddenly becomes a

156
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,919
game you know. Uh I can imagine someone

157
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,160
making that argument. is like it's not

158
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,479
the game until it's fun. But uh I much

159
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,800
rather sort of say fun engagement is

160
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,560
kind of more of a metric of how

161
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,240
well-designed your game is, not

162
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,440
necessarily

163
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,440
whether your game is a game. Um but you

164
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,400
know what but but but that is a goal of

165
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,560
a game designer to try to create a a a

166
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,039
engaging experience. Uh something that

167
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,280
people are going to want to do. Um there

168
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,319
are I know some game designers who think

169
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,680
that is not in fact their job. um their

170
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,360
job is to maximize revenue for instance

171
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,360
especially if you work in social games

172
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,720
uh that there's a lot of discussion now

173
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,319
in how business and game design is

174
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,319
basically just one thing now you know

175
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,800
the whole point of game design is how do

176
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,520
we get people to pay a little bit more

177
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,240
um Zinga is going to be on town by the

178
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:09,639
way on September 30th and giving a talk

179
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,639
uh so that has those two points

180
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,240
>> so Um, so I I will sort of coordinate

181
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,000
this out there as something that you

182
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,919
that you're working towards, but all

183
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,800
these other things, you know, um, a game

184
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,960
should have players. Uh, again, I don't

185
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,560
want to be too strict on that because

186
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,520
I've certainly seen games that play

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,560
themselves and um, anyone here involved

188
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,759
in battle code that that game pretty

189
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,120
much plays itself, right? I mean you set

190
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,199
it going and then someone one side wins

191
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,479
but no there's no human person at least

192
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,880
during the time when the game is

193
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,440
actually being played or you could argue

194
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,720
that a whole course of uh of battle code

195
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,240
for those people who don't know it's

196
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,400
this IP course I believe where uh core 6

197
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,479
students basically write bits of AI to

198
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,599
play a realtime strategy game against

199
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,199
some other team's AI and uh the basic

200
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,800
idea is that you know if you win a real

201
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,319
time strategy game your AI wins but

202
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,680
there's no human actually playing it at

203
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,680
a given time. But of course there are

204
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,080
humans writing the AI. So if if you

205
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,960
think of the entire class as a game uh

206
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,440
then there are players there are people

207
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,960
um there are I have certainly seen

208
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,080
people make a case that there are games

209
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,160
that are zero player and uh and I've

210
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,680
heard um for example there's a game out

211
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,840
there called Nomic which is largely a

212
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,840
game about coming up with rules and um

213
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,759
and there are there is a system which

214
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,360
are actually in the rules themselves

215
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,880
about how you change rules and you And

216
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,919
um of course those rules themselves can

217
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,599
be changed. Uh and and that changes the

218
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,279
way how you change rules. And by the

219
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,360
time you actually play the game,

220
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,560
someone's already won because somebody

221
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,000
in the game has no legal moves. Uh

222
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,440
that's that's the whole game. It's

223
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,040
basically making it impossible for

224
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,320
someone else for someone else except for

225
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,240
you to win. Um so does that game

226
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,360
actually have players? Well, yes it does

227
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,120
because you guys are arguing over who uh

228
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,720
all the rule changes, you know, and

229
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,959
through uh through the rules of the

230
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,160
game. But in a sense, it had no players

231
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,880
because the game never actually got

232
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,200
played. The the the rules are basically

233
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,720
stating, you know, this is an unplayable

234
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,680
game for everybody but except for one

235
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,720
person uh in the in in who's playing the

236
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,880
game. Um

237
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,000
goals. Goals are one of those things

238
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,680
that I used to be very very adamant

239
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,959
about like like a game had to have a

240
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,480
goal. You you have to know what you're

241
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,800
going towards and and if you don't have

242
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,080
that then it's a toy or something you

243
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,160
know it's a dollhouse. It's an

244
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,959
experiment. The Sims was the one that I

245
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,120
was like railing about when I was in an

246
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,200
undergraduate. Um you know that's not a

247
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,640
game. Um and of course my uh uh um I was

248
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,880
working with many colleagues and

249
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,279
eventually came across uh came over to

250
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,519
the site that it doesn't matter whether

251
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:58,240
I think it's a game or not. If it's in

252
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:00,240
the game shelf of Best Buy, it's a game.

253
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,080
So, you know, because people think it's

254
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,839
a game. And if enough people think it's

255
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,240
a game, then it might as well be a game,

256
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,240
you know, because otherwise what what uh

257
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,800
uh uh because that's what people think

258
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,360
it's going to be. So when when when you

259
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,519
come up with your game,

260
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,959
I would say that goals are one of those

261
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,040
things that helps steer player behavior.

262
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,600
So and it gives it's one of those tools

263
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,600
that you have as a designer to basically

264
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,640
say this is important, this is not.

265
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,399
Reaching the end of 100 meters is

266
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,880
important for a sprinter. Um that that

267
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,120
end is really not interesting for you

268
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,399
know somebody who's running 400 400

269
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,720
meters or 50 meter dash. Um but uh that

270
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,040
gives someone a direction for them to go

271
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,800
towards. But there are plenty of games

272
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,200
where you have to invent your own goals.

273
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,880
Can other than Sims, anyone can think of

274
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,800
any

275
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,920
where inventing your own goals is kind

276
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,640
of the fun

277
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,959
>> RPGs.

278
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,640
>> A lot of MMO RPGs have have that they

279
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,160
have goals. They have quests, but you

280
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,480
know that's not where a lot of the fun

281
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,360
is.

282
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,519
>> Second life.

283
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,800
>> Second Life. A lot of virtual worlds.

284
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,680
>> Game like Eve.

285
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,399
>> Uh Eve. Yeah. I mean Eve. if if you you

286
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,600
you kind of want to you like you have to

287
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,360
set your own goals, right? Because

288
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,839
whatever's in the game is only good

289
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,440
enough for like a single player to uh to

290
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,800
to tell whether a single player whether

291
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,560
they're doing well or not.

292
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,279
>> But the Eve is not about a single

293
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,160
player. Eve is about what thousands and

294
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,360
thousands of people playing

295
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,200
simultaneously.

296
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,920
>> Um

297
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,480
um actually have people heard of Eve?

298
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,240
>> Okay. Right. So yeah. Cool. Cool.

299
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,399
>> I stopped the development.

300
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,079
>> Oh, cool. In Iceland. Yeah.

301
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,480
>> Was it like really cheap when you went

302
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,519
over there? Could could you have bought

303
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,000
the entire studio?

304
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,800
>> No.

305
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,279
>> Unfortunately.

306
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,320
>> Yeah.

307
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,839
>> It was really cheap.

308
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,360
>> Yeah. Like months ago.

309
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,360
>> So they must have been making tons of

310
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,240
money because Yeah. They're making money

311
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,240
in US dollars and

312
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,240
>> euros.

313
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,200
Yeah. They probably hire most of Yeah.

314
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,560
support most of the economy.

315
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,839
>> Icelandic economy.

316
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,920
>> Yeah.

317
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,920
>> The capital is 20,000 people.

318
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,519
Yep.

319
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,320
>> Um

320
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,800
so um so I would say goals are very

321
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,200
important tools and as a result of that

322
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,680
you see them in a lot of the games and

323
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,279
you know uh for most of the games that

324
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,519
you guys are going to be building. Yeah.

325
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,279
Uh you're going to give a very clear

326
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,160
goal of this is what you want to do.

327
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,519
Earn a certain amount of money. Uh

328
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,680
prevent your opponent from doing

329
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,959
anything else. you know, uh, take over

330
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,880
all of the land, that sort of thing. Um,

331
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,560
let's see.

332
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:45,600
Well, I'll get to rules last. Um, but,

333
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,040
um, systems are, um, I might already

334
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,480
have mentioned this in the last class,

335
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,880
but, uh, games are systems in a way that

336
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,959
most MIT engineers would think of

337
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,880
systems. you know, they're a bunch of

338
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,639
interconnected little modules, all of

339
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,720
them with sort of predictable behavior,

340
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,399
and then you put them into a big

341
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,519
interconnected system, and it is no

342
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,160
longer really all that predictable

343
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,279
anymore. Um, at least that's the kind of

344
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,040
games that we're interested in this

345
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,639
class. There's also the game theory

346
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,639
games where like the whole point of it

347
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,959
is trying to predict what could possibly

348
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,480
happen. uh and uh those are those are

349
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,839
great thought experiments and there's

350
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,320
some really really interesting math

351
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,839
behind all all them and some interesting

352
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,600
rules of thumb that can come out but for

353
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,440
the most part we aren't going to go into

354
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,360
too much detail about that largely

355
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,680
because I'm not a mathematician or

356
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,560
economist so I don't really have a good

357
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,040
a good sense of game theory uh just be

358
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,760
aware that you know there is this whole

359
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,200
field of game theory in economics uh if

360
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,639
you're doing a game like an auction

361
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,200
system if you're doing a game where

362
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,800
people are doing uh either a lot of

363
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,160
simultaneous moves or um yeah or the

364
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,560
whole point of the game is trying to

365
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,399
predict what your what strategy your

366
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,600
your opponent is going to do. You might

367
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,360
actually want to read up a little bit of

368
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,959
game theory if nothing else just to give

369
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,079
you some vocabulary to talk about it

370
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,279
with your teammates uh and some tools to

371
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,199
be able to think through some of the

372
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,120
design problems that you've got. Um and

373
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:11,040
then we we we do have one session where

374
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,600
we I'll introduce some of them. Um and

375
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,279
finally we're getting to rules. Um you

376
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,360
know the the things that give that give

377
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,120
your game structure and you know the

378
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,079
limit the constraints of the things that

379
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,839
you can't do. You you can't move from

380
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,279
here to there without having your foot

381
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,399
tied to another player. You know that

382
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,560
that sort of constraint uh or a rule

383
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,720
being you know you can't say anything uh

384
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,880
during a a certain part of part of the

385
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,279
game. Um there are two uh there are two

386
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,839
bits of terminology introduced by Brendo

387
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,320
uh and and Ian Shriber in in their book

388
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,639
which is um core mechanic and core

389
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,320
dynamic. Um so before I'm going to go

390
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,519
into core mechanic and core dynamic and

391
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,519
then talk about mechanic and dynamic. Um

392
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,560
anyone want to throw out the definition

393
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,120
of mechanic?

394
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,279
It's sort of the uh the actions like a

395
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,160
player takes during a game like the

396
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,720
physical uh physical actions he takes.

397
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,600
>> Okay. The the actions that a player

398
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,800
decides to take

399
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,199
>> decides to take action.

400
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,720
>> Sorry if this is a little

401
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,199
>> um I saw Patrick and Oh, did those hands

402
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,600
just go there?

403
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,760
>> I thought I saw a few more hands.

404
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,720
>> Actions that are sort of designed by the

405
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,000
game designer.

406
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,000
>> Okay. So, intensive actions.

407
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,440
>> Um, design is definitely a good point.

408
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Uh, a game mechanic is definitely

409
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,920
something that you're uh that you as a

410
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,920
game designer control. Uh there are you

411
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,040
know if if if a player decides to do

412
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,680
something in the game that you did not

413
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,519
explicitly think about and you did not

414
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,720
explicitly say all right this is what

415
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,480
players are going to be doing in the

416
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,839
game then it might not not actually be a

417
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,440
mechanic. It might be something that

418
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,639
you're discovering in your play play

419
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,720
testing that you will turn into a

420
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,519
mechanic but because it's not designed

421
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,199
uh it's kind of it becomes more like a

422
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,639
strategy actually like a immersion

423
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,320
strategy. Sorry, you were saying Jeremy.

424
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,639
>> Is it more like a dynamic?

425
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,680
>> Um, possibly. There are times where it

426
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,440
is. Yeah. And yeah, um, actually let's

427
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,880
throw out some definitions of dynamic.

428
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,240
Uh, what do people

429
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,160
uh, well, Jeremy,

430
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,800
>> behavior that emerges from mechanics.

431
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,800
>> Okay. So, so emerges emergent behavior.

432
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,320
What what else

433
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,920
uh use of mechanics that isn't uh

434
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,399
directly stated in the rules of the

435
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,279
game?

436
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,279
>> Okay, so so unstated.

437
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,519
>> I'm running out of space here.

438
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,519
>> I thought I saw a hand.

439
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,040
No. Okay. Uh All right. So, um yeah,

440
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:55,040
dynamics are basically interactions of

441
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,759
mechanics. you know, it's like you don't

442
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,480
have a uh uh you don't have anything

443
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,120
that may necessarily explicitly say, you

444
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,799
know, because of this one rule and

445
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,919
because of one this other rule and

446
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,360
because of the things that the players

447
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,559
can do in that, you know, a a good

448
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,559
strategy is to do something else. So,

449
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,319
let me see whether I can think of an

450
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,919
example. Right now, everything that's

451
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,199
coming to my head is Starcraft. Um,

452
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,600
>> has that been the case for the past few

453
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,799
weeks?

454
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,400
>> Unfortunately, yes. Uh, by the way, if

455
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,039
anybody is playing Starcraft, I need

456
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,360
testers. Uh, because

457
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,440
>> yes,

458
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,039
>> I I I need testers for a map that I'm

459
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,760
resigning. Um,

460
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,440
>> especially

461
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,440
I play

462
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,559
>> there's a good example in Puerto Rico.

463
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,080
>> Oh, yeah.

464
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,320
>> Right. So, there's this role selection

465
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,320
mechanic where everybody picks the thing

466
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,799
which they want to happen during the

467
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,760
turn and they get a bonus for doing it.

468
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,240
Um and also everybody chooses to like

469
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,520
build particular crops.

470
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,919
>> Um and the dynamic that emerges from the

471
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,480
sequence of play which goes clockwise is

472
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:06,320
that it's best to

473
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,760
optimize your strategy so that you are

474
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,280
doing so that you are benefiting from

475
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,200
the role that the person to your right

476
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,480
is most likely to choose.

477
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,720
>> But you're making the goods that the

478
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,400
person to your left is most likely to

479
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,919
want to ship or sell. So the mechanic is

480
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,080
roll selection and turn order

481
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,280
>> and then the dynamic is the strategy

482
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,200
written purpose out of that

483
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,120
>> which which gives you some idea on what

484
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,600
to select as oo you know the the

485
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,400
mechanic is you can select the dynamic

486
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,080
is here are a couple of strategies that

487
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,760
you can use in sort of assessing what

488
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,000
would be best to select. Um, and if all

489
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,559
the players start to understand that,

490
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,880
then it almost becomes like a, you know,

491
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,480
like a second layer of rules almost. And

492
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,320
if anyone's played a game like Bridge,

493
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,919
for instance, there's actually a ton of

494
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,520
things that are assumed in the play

495
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,280
which are not actually in the rules of

496
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,039
bridge. Uh, when it comes to bidding,

497
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,640
like when you call out a bid, it's

498
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,360
highly dependent on what you actually

499
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,440
have in your cart uh in in in your card

500
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,440
hand. And that's not actually written in

501
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,880
the rules anywhere. Um but the

502
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,640
assumption is that there is optimal way

503
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,240
to do it and since there's optimal way

504
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,480
to do it everyone's expected to know

505
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,880
there's optimal ways. Um the example in

506
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,600
the book was chess moves like you know

507
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,760
every single move uh piece of chess uh

508
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,360
has a set of moves that it can perform

509
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,360
right pawns go one or two squares

510
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,600
depending whether the starting uh

511
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:30,120
bishops move diagonally but there are

512
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,120
also opening gambits.

513
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,400
There are opening habits that that that

514
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,320
that are uh that are also wellknown at

515
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,480
least among professional uh chess

516
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,039
players. And the idea being oh this

517
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,080
person is using this opening therefore

518
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,240
if I counter it with this response I

519
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,559
actually have uh you know a reasonable

520
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,320
chance of actually winning the the this

521
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,679
game and professional chess players know

522
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,640
this. Um the other thing that comes up

523
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,039
in chess which is not in the book is uh

524
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,160
there is um there is the concept of

525
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,400
threatened squares. If you if you move u

526
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,320
if there is a square where there is no

527
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,640
piece on a chess board. Everyone here

528
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,919
knows the rules of chess more or less.

529
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,120
Yeah. Um, so say you've got a bishop and

530
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:18,240
you know this is my very simple chess

531
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,559
board and you've got a bishop

532
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,600
um and and and it can move like that,

533
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,400
right? So every single square along

534
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,840
these lines uh is threatened. It's it's

535
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,919
something which a uh which which a uh

536
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,919
the bishop could move to unless of

537
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,280
course it's you know blocked by by a

538
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,280
pawn or something and these are no

539
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,679
longer threatened. what it honest um

540
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,600
uh if if you're a knight obviously is no

541
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,520
longer straight lines. It becomes, you

542
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,120
know, specific sort of like a weird

543
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,760
stochastic pattern of squares that

544
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,640
become threatened. Uh but uh but but but

545
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,960
but the idea of here's this square now

546
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,559
that nobody dares move into until

547
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,480
something's done about that bishop.

548
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,799
Either move something gets moved in its

549
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,240
way or you know some something takes out

550
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,720
that bishop or forces the bishop to move

551
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,840
by threatening. it instead in a way that

552
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,280
they cannot respond. So threats and

553
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,200
squares is not a rule in in in in uh in

554
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,360
chess but it greatly shapes your

555
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,960
decision m your decision making and

556
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,400
that's the difference between dynamic

557
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:26,080
and mechanic. Um there's a lot of strong

558
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:31,039
correspondence between uh mechanics and

559
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:35,200
weights. Um but uh and and I had a long

560
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,880
long uh little rant about exactly what

561
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,200
the difference is between mechanics and

562
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,360
rules and uh and what I basically I I

563
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,960
I'm not going to give the rant right now

564
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,559
but but it's like overlapping ven

565
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,159
diagram you know there's a very very

566
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,600
large area where it's exactly the same

567
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,720
thing. Um, my general rubric for you for

568
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,039
trying to figure out whether something

569
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,720
is a mechanic or not is whether this is

570
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,799
the thing that changes the state of the

571
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,080
game. If it's an action, if it's if it's

572
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,880
something that someone's going to be

573
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,200
doing to change the state of what the

574
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,440
game is, you know, in chess, that's

575
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:12,480
largely the move the movement of of a

576
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,880
piece. Um if it's um

577
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,960
uh if it's ultimate you know it could be

578
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,880
just physical movement you know you are

579
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,480
limited on when you can physically move

580
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,039
if you have that frisbee you're not

581
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,039
moving uh well you're feet are not

582
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:32,080
moving I believe that's a of

583
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:34,559
um so so uh the the reason why I use

584
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,480
that definition is because there are

585
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,559
occasionally times where I need to talk

586
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,760
about mechanics that players aren't

587
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,400
actually doing like the game requires

588
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,320
certain pieces to move in a certain way,

589
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,280
certain things to happen in the game.

590
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,400
You know, um in Settlers of Katan, for

591
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,200
instance, you have these die rolls. Uh

592
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,000
and um actually that's not a good

593
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,440
example, let me think. Um well, right at

594
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,120
the beginning of Setters of Katanda is

595
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,720
the way how you set up the board and

596
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,720
that establishes what a game state is

597
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,159
going to be. You know, it it changes the

598
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,000
game state by giving you a game state in

599
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,080
the first place. um that I I I consider

600
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,400
that a mechanic that that is something

601
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,760
that's going uh that that it's but

602
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,960
that's not one one rule. It's actually a

603
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,919
whole collection of rules and if you're

604
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,760
interested in finding out what those

605
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,480
rules are, the box is actually in that

606
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,520
closet over there. Um but it's like

607
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,039
something like five or six different

608
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,480
rules on this is how you set up your

609
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,600
board. It's going to set up your game

610
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,640
state and I consider that a mechanic. Um

611
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,960
how people do bidding and buying things

612
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,880
in setters of katan that's dynamic. you

613
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,600
know that's that you know there are no

614
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,200
real rules on how much something costs

615
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,120
that's up to the players to work out on

616
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,400
their own um so that's how I sort of

617
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,200
consider the difference between core

618
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,080
dynamic uh between dynamic and and and

619
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,080
mechanic um really really useful

620
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,360
concepts because really for the most

621
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,000
part as a designer you have an idea of

622
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,799
what kind of dynamics are interesting uh

623
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and the more games that you play the and

624
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,200
you know the more inspiration that you

625
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,440
get from various sources. Uh your vocab

626
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,200
your range of different ideas of what

627
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,360
kind of dynamics might be interesting is

628
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,360
going to expand. Uh but all you have

629
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,960
control on are mechanics are the

630
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,880
specific rules that that you're giving

631
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,679
your your

632
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,600
note that game mechanics don't

633
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,440
necessarily need to be written uh or

634
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,000
described out. Um, this is one thing

635
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,159
that I think you and your teammates

636
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,640
should figure out when you're talking

637
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,840
about mechanics for a given project. Are

638
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,440
we just talking about the things that

639
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,240
we're writing down? Because there are

640
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:46,159
some assumptions that uh that are just

641
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:47,200
given. Um, we are playing a game in,

642
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,200
you know, we're playing some sort of

643
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,279
schoolyard game or something, you know,

644
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,039
uh, hitting people with large solid

645
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,200
solid objects is disallowed or something

646
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,840
like that, you know, not necessarily

647
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,840
something you need to write down unless

648
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,520
you're playing with certain people, but

649
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,400
you have uh, you know, but you can

650
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,039
assume that's a game a game mechanic

651
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,720
there. Um, things like how fast, you

652
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,159
know, people normally do things. There's

653
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,400
a game over there over over here called

654
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,960
Falling uh which is actually a real-time

655
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,480
card game. It it goes as fast as you can

656
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,080
possibly play it. And uh there is no

657
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,840
there is no limit on how fast you can

658
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,440
play these cards, but there is a real

659
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,799
physical limit on how fast you can

660
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,600
physically grab a card out of your hand

661
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,960
and put it down. Uh so actually it's not

662
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,760
even on your hand. You're just moving

663
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:36,279
cards on the table. So uh so make sure

664
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,279
you give that a try uh today.

665
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:46,720
Oh um finally uh we'll we'll we'll we'll

666
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,799
be getting to aesthetics uh I think next

667
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,039
class next week.

668
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:54,400
>> Yeah. Okay. So, so which is another

669
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,240
thing which uh a game designer uh in

670
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,679
fact which is what I would like game

671
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,960
designers to actually spend more time

672
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,799
thinking about which is what is the

673
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,640
feeling you want your player to have as

674
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,159
opposed to this might be fun you know

675
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,240
it's like oh this might be engaging it's

676
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,880
like specifically how is it fun how is

677
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,120
it engaging is it fun as in like yes

678
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,039
victory I have crushed all my opponents

679
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,640
or is it fun as in wow we had a really

680
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,159
good time together and we got to know

681
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,360
each other really well you know there

682
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,360
are games that are designed for both of

683
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,559
those Um and uh and what what is the

684
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,080
aesthetic you're going for? You going

685
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,760
for something poetic? Are you going for

686
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,159
something, you know, fiercely

687
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,000
competitive, uh tournament competitive,

688
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,400
or you going for, you know, just a nice

689
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,440
little social experiment? Um

690
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,400
core mechanics and core dynamics are uh

691
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,520
are a tool again for designers. uh the

692
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,799
idea of there there really isn't a huge

693
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,960
difference between what's a core

694
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,200
mechanic and what's just a mechanic uh

695
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,640
except inside a designer or a design

696
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,120
team's uh discussion. Um the idea of

697
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,679
having a core core mechanic as you

698
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,360
identify this is what our game's about

699
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,279
uh or a core dynamic mean this is what

700
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,440
our game uh our game's about. And a lot

701
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,120
of core core mechanics in first-person

702
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,400
shooters is pointing and shooting,

703
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,679
right? I'm going to point at something

704
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,279
and I'm going to launch a projectile

705
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,120
that way and that projectile is going to

706
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,039
move in a certain some physical

707
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,159
properties. You know, maybe it arcs,

708
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:19,760
maybe it goes straight. Um, and other

709
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,960
core uh I would say that the core

710
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,559
mechanic of Halo isn't actually that

711
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:31,440
core uh who has not played Halo or seen

712
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:35,440
someone play Halo. Okay. Um, so like the

713
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,640
I the core mechanic or I think my Budgie

714
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,960
calls it the core gameplay loop um uh of

715
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,840
uh of Halo is you shoot at something,

716
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,320
you take cover, you throw a grenade at

717
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,679
it, you wait for the grenade to go off,

718
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,279
and then you shoot it again until it

719
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:56,159
dies. Um, right. That's pretty much all

720
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,039
you're doing for the entirety of Halo 1.

721
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,679
Um sure Halo 2 Halo 3 gets complicated.

722
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,120
Yeah. You know um but but but they

723
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,440
identify that if you actually read the

724
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,919
postmortems and and if you read at the

725
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,520
talks that they've given they say those

726
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,120
I can't I can't remember it's 20 seconds

727
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,279
or 5 seconds of gameplay which they use

728
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,440
to describe that. I think it's five that

729
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,399
5second of game play is what they

730
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,799
focused on. And if they could get every

731
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,640
little thing in that sequence correct

732
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,000
they can repeat that same thing at

733
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,120
infinitum and you'll still be having

734
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,760
fun.

735
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,440
um Halo one everyone,

736
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,880
you know, they're they're kind of right.

737
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,880
But the idea being, you know, if you've

738
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,320
got a core mechanic, if you've got one

739
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,000
thing in your game that someone's going

740
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,360
to be doing over and over and over

741
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,640
again, all your players are going to be

742
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,320
doing over and over again, maybe it's

743
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,520
bidding because they're making some kind

744
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,600
of auction game. Um, in falling, it's

745
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,320
and in pit it's transferring cards to

746
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,840
other people. Um,

747
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,360
uh, I'm trying to think of the other

748
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,600
games that we've got here. Um in in Siss

749
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,279
fight, I would imagine is the the main

750
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,919
the main core mechanic would be uh

751
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,039
putting down the card uh and and

752
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,039
everyone revealing the card

753
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,120
simultaneously because you you you all

754
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,039
take simultaneous turns. You know, make

755
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,600
sure that's really really fun and Yazi

756
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,200
is rolling dice. You know, that's that

757
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,159
action, that thing that you're going to

758
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,120
be doing over and over again has to be

759
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,200
at least fairly engaging. Um because if

760
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,960
you c if you can't get that right then

761
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,360
what happens is that that same movement

762
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,919
that happens 30 50 times in your game

763
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,640
you know just gets m the badness just

764
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,760
gets multiplied by 30 or 50 uh and and

765
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,399
and you don't want that. So for core

766
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,720
mechanics you know I I would say the

767
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,559
thing that happens in your game the most

768
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,799
and uh and you want to make sure that

769
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,720
that part is is as engaging as possible.

770
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,600
It also gives you a rubric to say what's

771
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,360
not a core mechanic might be in fact

772
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,520
expendable. You might not actually need

773
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,960
it in your game. So if you've got a

774
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,200
problem, this game takes too long to

775
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,559
play, this game's too hard to learn, uh

776
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,159
this game's over too fast, it's too

777
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,600
random or something, take a look at all

778
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,960
the things that are, you know, of course

779
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,880
make sure that your core mechanic is not

780
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,000
the cause of the problem. But if the

781
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,960
your core mechanic doesn't seem to be

782
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,480
the cause of the problem, that seems to

783
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,760
be working. Something else in the game

784
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,799
is not working. Everything else is

785
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,159
expandable. And so you you you you can

786
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,600
look at everything else in your game,

787
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,600
all these other rules that you've got

788
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,200
and say, "How does that work with the

789
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,279
coral mechanic? How does that help? How

790
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,600
does that hurt the coral mechanic?" It

791
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,200
just helps your discussion as a team. Uh

792
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,120
or as a game or as an individual game

793
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,799
designer, it helps your thinking about

794
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,799
what could we throw out, what could we

795
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,919
keep.

796
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:37,360
Um similarly for core dynamic it's you

797
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,480
know it's like here's this particular

798
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,799
um uh particular interaction that we

799
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,399
really really want um in cisifi is

800
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:49,039
guessing what other people are going to

801
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:51,760
do um and uh I'm trying to think of

802
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:55,679
other examples and like territorial

803
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:58,880
uh space acquisition I guess go is about

804
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,480
taking over territory in space um you

805
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,640
know if that's your core dynamic if you

806
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,399
say that's kind of fun. Just making sure

807
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,159
that I'm in control of a space and

808
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,080
nobody else can do anything that they

809
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,880
want to do in a certain part of the

810
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,640
board. That's fun. Um that's what I'm

811
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,960
going for. That's my core dynamic.

812
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,799
That's what this game is all about. Then

813
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,640
you can look at every single mechanic,

814
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:23,360
even your core mechanics, and say, is it

815
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,960
all serving that goal? Now, there's a

816
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,559
whole bunch of uh tips right at the end

817
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:31,440
of chapter one of uh of uh challenges

818
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:34,080
for game designers about how to break

819
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,279
designer block. Um but I would say

820
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,559
actually those things are just things

821
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,559
that you should be doing all the time.

822
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,240
Um not not just when you have a problem,

823
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,919
but you should be experimenting things

824
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,919
like, you know, okay, you've got a

825
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,679
variable, you know, draw two cards every

826
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,200
turn or something. Multiply it by two,

827
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,799
see what it does to your game. Have it,

828
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,600
draw one card, see what it does to your

829
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:55,039
game. um you know throw a rule out you

830
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,880
know um it and and that sort of gets you

831
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,720
to the whole iterative design thing is

832
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,039
that you don't actually because games

833
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,360
are systems they're these complex little

834
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,720
collections of seemingly simple things

835
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,559
you don't actually know how these

836
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,640
changes are really going to affect your

837
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,840
game. You may have a hunch but until you

838
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,880
actually play it out you don't actually

839
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,240
know. So um so the whole point of

840
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,799
iterative of iterative the design in in

841
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,200
engineering as well as in game design is

842
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:24,399
that you know you you make the change.

843
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,480
There has to be a substantial change. Um

844
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:30,159
and then you actually put it to the test

845
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,720
and see what happens. Um this means of

846
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,559
course testing and testing takes a long

847
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,159
time and if you're going to be making a

848
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,279
game that takes a long time then your

849
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,880
testing gets even longer. So, uh, for

850
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,640
the first project that's going to be

851
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,480
coming out, the assignment, uh,

852
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,399
assignment one, you want to be aiming

853
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,799
for games that take really not very long

854
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,640
to play. Um, these games that we've got

855
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,840
today, I'm not sure about shake, but I

856
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,919
know everything else that we've got on

857
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,360
that table is pretty darn fast, which

858
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,200
means, you know, if you've got an hour

859
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,960
with four people, uh, who've never

860
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,360
played your game before, maybe you get

861
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,200
through two or three rounds, four rounds

862
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,279
of them, you know, each time maybe

863
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,120
tweaking a rule once, uh, uh, here and

864
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,279
there and seeing how that change that

865
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,960
that changed the game. If you've got a

866
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,880
game that takes an hour to play, and

867
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,640
believe me, a lot of the of the projects

868
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,679
that we've gotten from previous

869
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,240
semesters take at least an hour to play,

870
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,679
um, then you know you've got four people

871
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,080
for an hour and they're not going to

872
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,440
finish the a single play of the game

873
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,360
because by the time they finish learning

874
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,279
your your your game, half your time is

875
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,399
up.

876
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,799
Um, so that's the process that we would

877
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,320
like you all to be using in your teams,

878
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,360
in your assignments. this iterative

879
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:43,200
design pro process right from the

880
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,720
beginning uh I wish I had more space um

881
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,840
but uh we're going to start with

882
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:51,120
brainstorming uh there that's actually

883
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,360
going to be Friday the 17th where we'll

884
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,760
actually sort of uh for folks who

885
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,480
haven't necessarily formally learned uh

886
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,480
bra bra bra bra bra bra bra bra bra bra

887
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,480
bra bra bra bra bra bra bra bra bra bra

888
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,039
brainstorming, we're just going to do a

889
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,799
quick refresher uh so that everyone s

890
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,039
sort of is on the same page. You learn

891
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,519
how to do brainstorming. Um, you come up

892
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,960
with a basic idea of your game and you

893
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,599
start to identify things that could be

894
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,520
your core dynamics. You know, you think

895
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,480
of what what sort of core mechanics

896
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,520
could address that. Knock something up

897
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,359
really really quickly with the crappiest

898
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,399
materials you can get your hands on and

899
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,240
start playing. Um, since nobody in your

900
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:27,599
team knows really what game you're

901
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,879
making at that point of time, you can

902
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,560
probably test it with your team. As soon

903
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,800
as you do that a few times, your team

904
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,480
becomes useless as play as testers

905
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,159
because you already know too much about

906
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,000
about the game and what and and what the

907
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,159
game could have been and you start

908
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,839
playing it in ways that a fresh person

909
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,079
who's never seen your game before

910
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,599
wouldn't even consider. Um, so you

911
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,000
actually want to keep looking for people

912
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,520
who've never played your game before. So

913
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
the next step would be to broaden it to

914
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,440
other teams in this class. Um, since

915
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,119
everyone's going to be broken up in more

916
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,560
or less teams of three or four, that's

917
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,240
pretty much, you know, I'm going to take

918
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,599
this game that we designed for a team of

919
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,040
three or four and give it to that team

920
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,480
of three or four and then you play their

921
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,200
game and, you know, give each other

922
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,200
feedback. And that lasts for about one

923
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,640
more session and after that, everyone in

924
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,000
the class has used this now. So, you

925
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,760
have to go and look for doormates,

926
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,520
friends, you know, um, people on the

927
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,119
street, you know, just go right ahead

928
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,640
and try to get as much feedback as you

929
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,880
can.

930
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,599
Um

931
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,480
there is some value in replaying um

932
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,640
especially later on once your rules are

933
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,400
pretty set uh in that people start

934
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,760
developing strategies those sort of

935
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:36,079
emergent uh uh behaviors and you start

936
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,839
understanding sort of higher level play

937
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,280
of your game and you do want to test

938
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:44,320
that um but don't let that prevent you

939
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,560
from also testing with fresh players uh

940
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,160
because in the end um you have to get

941
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,400
past that initial hurdle. Anytime

942
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,240
someone sees your game, they are going

943
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,079
to have to learn to learn your game from

944
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,000
scratch at least once. And if they don't

945
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,560
even get that far, they're never playing

946
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,480
it your game a second or a third time.

947
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,480
So don't optimize for the people who

948
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,280
played your game, you know, for for

949
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,480
weeks because the um because you really

950
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,599
want the people who've only played it

951
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,520
once uh to have a good time as well.

952
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,000
Um, that's not necessarily the case if

953
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,320
you're making, you know, uh, a huge

954
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,599
wellunded game with based on a franchise

955
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,440
that, you know, that's been around

956
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,880
forever. If you're doing Halo 3 or

957
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,560
Modern Warfare 3 or something like that,

958
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,800
you know, then sure, you can sort of

959
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,960
cater to the fans uh, who've already

960
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,040
developed these strategies and and

961
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,320
skills. But in in our case, we're

962
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,760
develop we're going after a new

963
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,200
audience. We're going after someone

964
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,320
who's never played anything like what

965
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,320
what you've played before.

966
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,400
Cool. Any

967
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:46,720
questions?

968
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:49,440
I've been soap boxing here for a while

969
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,040
Jason.

970
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,960
>> Um,

971
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,400
so I guess the other thing that I would

972
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,359
that I would add from my experience,

973
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,839
especially with iterative design, is a

974
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,680
big trick of it is learning to kind of

975
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,560
distance yourself emotionally from what

976
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,560
you're working on. Um, because half the

977
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,160
time you end up chucking things that you

978
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,599
really like. you think, "Oh, this would

979
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,839
be so great, but it's best to just

980
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,119
remove it." Um, it helps to think of it

981
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,560
as putting kind of putting it on the

982
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,160
shelf for later and saying, "Okay, I'll

983
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,200
deal with this later. I can try this in

984
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,640
another game." Um, and on a related

985
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,040
note, I don't know about you, but I

986
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,440
found that when games I'm designing have

987
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,320
a problem, it's almost always fixed by

988
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,320
removing something as opposed to adding

989
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,240
more stuff on. Um, unless you're going

990
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,000
for something, I think really complex

991
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,320
off the start, I always prefer to try

992
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,160
and take something out something out and

993
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,760
simplify it.

994
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,240
>> Yeah, especially in short projects like

995
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,000
these, it almost always works better.

996
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,760
Um,

997
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,839
and then and in terms of testing too,

998
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,520
one thing just kind of a a tip that I

999
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,440
find works is if you're designing a game

1000
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,960
that has a lot of different um like

1001
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,240
paths to victory, and this is a little

1002
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,320
bit higher level, but you'll see what I

1003
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,000
mean when we get there, where if you

1004
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,160
want a game that has different viable

1005
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,960
strategies, a really good testing method

1006
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,040
is to have different people kind of play

1007
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,640
like a perfect version of that strategy.

1008
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,240
And you say, I'm going to do this

1009
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,520
strategy or I'm always going to do X.

1010
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,599
And it doesn't matter if I think it's

1011
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,440
dumb, I'm just going to do it. Um

1012
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,200
because that'll really help you find

1013
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,400
rules that are broken or find something

1014
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,839
that's overpowered. Um a good example

1015
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,760
would be Settlers, right? Like if you

1016
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,880
say, "I'm obviously this wouldn't work

1017
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,880
because the game is a good game, but

1018
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,560
like I'm always going to build roads."

1019
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,400
You know what I mean? Like in practice

1020
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,839
that would be stupid, but if you're when

1021
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,359
you're designing a game, you do that

1022
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,440
kind of strategy and you just limit

1023
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,960
yourself to one action, you can really

1024
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,440
find things that are broken really

1025
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,440
quickly.

1026
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,040
Um,

1027
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,000
thanks. Yeah.

1028
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,520
Much appreciated. Cookies, dude. We have

1029
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,400
cookies.

1030
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,920
Thanks, Google. Just the Google family.

1031
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,119
Uh,

1032
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,079
uh, let's see. So, um, so yeah, we I

1033
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,560
think after this we're just going to

1034
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,119
play games. Uh well um we do have a play

1035
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,119
testing as a topic coming up later in

1036
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,800
the semester where we'll actually sort

1037
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:12,720
of talk about the discipline on how you

1038
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:15,839
do testing. Uh uh honestly it's

1039
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,040
you shouldn't wait for that class to

1040
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:21,599
necessarily start practicing. Uh you

1041
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,040
know if you it could be as simple as

1042
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,240
just grabbing a game that you have never

1043
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,440
seen before and just trying to get a

1044
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,880
whole bunch of people to play it and

1045
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,040
critiquing it at the same time. you

1046
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,640
know, it's like why did I do that? Why

1047
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,920
did you do that? Why did you do that

1048
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,440
move? You know, and um there are sort of

1049
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,320
practices to make sure that when it's

1050
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,119
your game, you are not sort of telling

1051
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,640
the players what they should be doing uh

1052
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,280
while they are trying to play the game

1053
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,640
because that affects their player uh in

1054
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,240
the game in a way that biases it. Uh but

1055
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,280
uh but we'll get to that later in the

1056
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,440
semester. for now, you know, uh just

1057
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,960
just be aware the more that you're

1058
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,640
testing, the more that you're sort of

1059
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,160
tweaking your rules in between tests and

1060
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,400
then getting another chance to test and

1061
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,000
test and test, the closer you are to

1062
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,000
getting a game that's actually fun and

1063
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,119
engaging to play. Um, and that's what

1064
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,960
we're looking for. That's the process

1065
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,400
that we expect you folks to to stick in.

1066
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,720
Whe whether you ever get to fun and

1067
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,760
engaging, who knows? We don't know

1068
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,960
whether you're going to get there. So,

1069
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,240
we're not grading you based on that.

1070
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,400
Just remember that. We're not grading

1071
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,480
you on how engaging your games are, but

1072
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,160
how well you stick to the process. Yes,

1073
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,240
absolutely.

1074
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:30,079
Um, there was a question on the forums

1075
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:32,160
about when do you stop, right?

1076
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,680
Did you put it up? Um, I didn't get a

1077
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,640
chance to look too closely at it. What?

1078
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,240
Um, can can you repeat?

1079
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,079
>> So, essentially, it's the question of so

1080
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,320
there's this iterative design process

1081
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,320
and when do you know when to sort of get

1082
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,280
out of that process?

1083
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,880
>> Due date.

1084
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,480
>> The due date. Okay. All right. That's

1085
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,320
always a good reason. Uh,

1086
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,000
>> but I guess like if you didn't have a

1087
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,280
due date, like how would you know when

1088
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,640
to ship or let's say you have control

1089
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,880
over the due date?

1090
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,160
>> Um, I guess part of that is you should

1091
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,680
always be iterate like you should always

1092
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,960
be updating blah blah.

1093
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,240
>> So I guess the question is when do you

1094
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,920
know when you have something that you

1095
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,760
can put out into like the world?

1096
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,240
>> Um, so the cynical answer yeah is that

1097
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,680
is that you wait for you know you have

1098
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,200
to ship right or you're not getting any

1099
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:17,599
cash. Um, the I personally think it will

1100
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,839
be sooner soon. s sooner than you think.

1101
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,520
It's like, you know, oh, my game's

1102
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,920
almost ready, but I notice something

1103
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,040
wrong with it. Especially when you're a

1104
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,880
student. Um, right. Right now, I'm in

1105
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,760
this I'm in this mode with my Starcraft

1106
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,119
apps, which is this map is crap. I know

1107
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,560
there's something wrong with it. I have

1108
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,960
no idea what it is. Therefore, I'm going

1109
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,040
to release it. Uh, because until I do

1110
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,359
that, I have no idea what's wrong with

1111
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,040
it. I need to get that that that

1112
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,839
information. The nice thing about stuff

1113
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,160
like, you know, uh, computer games is

1114
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,560
that you can ship updates. Um, it's

1115
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,880
annoying, but you can. But even board

1116
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,720
games and card games now have re rule

1117
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,160
revisions, rule clarifications that you

1118
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:01,280
can release o um, uh, over the net. Uh,

1119
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,440
for the most part, if you are going to

1120
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,839
go professional, your publisher will

1121
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,359
tell you and then the answer really is

1122
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,359
due date, right? You know, it's like

1123
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:12,319
it's going to the presses on this date.

1124
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,599
And uh that's one maxim which is game

1125
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,160
projects are never finished. They're

1126
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,440
just abandoned. Um you know it's just

1127
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,800
all you know I can't do anything else

1128
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,000
about this because I'm out of time. Ship

1129
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,200
it. Um but one thing that you can do to

1130
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,440
prepare for that um let me see is there

1131
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,440
an er

1132
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,079
there there's a guy who runs a blog

1133
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,319
called Lost Garden. His name is Dan

1134
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,880
Cook. He works over in Microsoft and he

1135
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,160
talks a lot about game design um

1136
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,280
specifically about video game design,

1137
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,760
but actually his stuff is actually

1138
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,040
really really applicable and he has this

1139
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,680
concept that you know game design or

1140
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:58,560
iterative game design kind of goes in

1141
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:00,720
this in this kind of cycle where uh this

1142
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,960
is this width down here is the number of

1143
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:07,280
features that you've got in your game.

1144
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:11,040
Uh the trick though is that um what you

1145
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:15,079
are really doing is you are taking

1146
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,079
let me see if this is right.

1147
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,400
So this is all the good stuff. This is

1148
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:25,359
all the stuff that's not so good. Um,

1149
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,400
and the whole idea of of of

1150
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:32,160
sort of like using iterative design is

1151
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,680
to allow yourself to the space to come

1152
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,599
up with a whole bunch of ideas not

1153
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,920
knowing whether they're good or bad, but

1154
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:41,680
then also give you a gate to cut out all

1155
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:45,040
the bad stuff. So at any so at frequent

1156
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:49,119
periodic intervals you have a collection

1157
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,760
of rules of cards of designs of whatever

1158
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,119
consists your game that is pretty much

1159
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,319
as good as you possibly could have made

1160
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,319
it given the amount of time that you've

1161
00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:00,960
got and that could ship. Um so you know

1162
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:02,160
so if if your ship date was here you

1163
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,920
would have as good a game as you

1164
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,520
possibly could doing it. if ship date

1165
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,839
turned out to be there all of a sudden.

1166
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,680
You know, you've still got you still had

1167
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:12,640
the opportunity to quiddle out all of

1168
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,760
the all the stuff that you knew was bad.

1169
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,000
Um so iterative design is not about

1170
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,160
let's just keep accreating more and more

1171
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
and more and more features. It's more

1172
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,280
about you know we're going to add some

1173
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,760
features and then we're going to remove

1174
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,520
the ones that don't work. Um and that's

1175
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,000
really really important. Uh so that at

1176
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,640
any given time you're prepared to sort

1177
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,720
of release it. Um, and as for when you

1178
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,640
actually decide that this is now ready

1179
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,920
to go out, I would again I would I would

1180
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,760
repeat sooner than than you think

1181
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,560
because you need that feedback. U

1182
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,319
sometimes uh you don't know how a market

1183
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,280
is going to respond until you actually

1184
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:49,359
do it. But you can do a soft launch. Uh

1185
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,119
if you're doing uh commercial product,

1186
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,599
you you can do things where we're going

1187
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,200
to release it to a few select stores and

1188
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:59,040
get that feedback before we go into

1189
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,800
major print run uh or you know uh burn

1190
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,680
burn 10,000 different copies of the same

1191
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,319
board game. Uh we're going to do 200

1192
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,760
copies and see how that does for us. It

1193
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,119
gives you the opportunity to to make a

1194
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,119
revision, but it's still an official

1195
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,599
release because those 200 people think

1196
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,720
that this is the final package product.

1197
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,040
Um that's pretty much how a lot of

1198
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,319
manufacturing industries actually work

1199
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,480
anyway. So if you think about u any kind

1200
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,079
of product design, a lot of them have a

1201
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,520
sort of like trial period.

1202
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,160
>> Soft drinks

1203
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,599
>> soft drinks you get a lot um Japanese

1204
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,440
electronics you know it's like you

1205
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,200
release it in Tokyo and then you release

1206
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,800
it in the rest of Japan. Uh and

1207
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,680
sometimes it never makes it out out of

1208
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,920
Japan. uh because you know that initial

1209
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,359
test yeah it was it was a good product

1210
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,119
but not enough people bought it because

1211
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:47,200
of these problems. So instead of

1212
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,440
releasing into the world we're going to

1213
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:52,480
make version two and maybe that will be

1214
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,040
one release too. That's that's that's

1215
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,319
one example.

1216
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:02,480
All right. So we have games

1217
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:04,319
um but who has not played?

1218
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,800
>> Okay. All right. We have more games than

1219
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:09,440
we have.

1220
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,880
No. Okay. So, um Jason, you're going to

1221
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,480
do a youer uh table. So, um

1222
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,200
>> like just a four player trick taking

1223
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,200
game. Kind of vehicles.

1224
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,880
>> Um looks like we have exactly four

1225
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,359
people. One, two, three. One, two,

1226
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,839
three. Oh, yeah. We have an average of

1227
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:34,079
three people per table. That table is

1228
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:37,359
four. Um, I think most of these games

1229
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:41,160
are three to five players, although I'm

1230
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,160
going to be absolutely

1231
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,400
>> Yeah. This is like four to eight.

1232
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,440
>> You guys play fully.

1233
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,200
>> Yeah. So, so falling might want to be

1234
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,720
larger table. You guys might actually

1235
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,119
want to try the round table in the

1236
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,040
corner.

1237
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,160
>> Yeah. It says table.

1238
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,680
>> Yeah. 48 people.

1239
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,319
>> I really want to play.

1240
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,520
>> All right. Let's do this play.

1241
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,560
Please. Um,

1242
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:07,280
>> so basically take a game um uh from the

1243
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:10,240
table. Uh, I'll I'll bring some out and

1244
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,160
I'll see that play uh play them. Once

1245
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,680
you've had a chance to play a few times,

1246
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,359
feel free to switch

1247
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,680
>> and try to get as many games played as

1248
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,960
possible during during the next couple

1249
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,760
of hours and stuff.

1250
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,760
>> Cool.
