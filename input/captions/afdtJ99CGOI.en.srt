always instilled

WARREN SEERING: There
was really only one thing

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,130
that mattered to him.

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,350
It was all about the
students and what they should

14
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,390
get from the MIT experience.

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,650
He lived for that.

00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,950
DAVID GOSSARD: Woodie was no
stranger to simply building

17
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,810
things from scratch.

18
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,450
To him, that's what engineering
was or what it should be.

19
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,860
So as soon as he was given
a course, his view was,

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,780
I'm not going to be
making them do drawings.

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,849
I'm going to-- they're going
to build something, by gum.

SANJAY SARMA: When MIT
was established in 1861,

23
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,760
it was designed as a
technical university.

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,230
And over the years lectures have
displaced the hands-on stuff.

25
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,820

30
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,550
Their idea of design
at the time was

31
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,250
to draw drawings of
parts of designs.

32
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,323

was a terrific idea,

which was to give
the entire class, 100

39

a common goal, which

40
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:52,330
was to build a machine to climb
a hill or pick up golf balls

make a contest out of it.

understate how important he

everything was much more

had never been made before.

the magic was Woodie.

on innovation itself.
