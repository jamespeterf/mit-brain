1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,839
So final session of the afternoon. Um

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,840
Fiona uh is my boss. She's the professor

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,480
and we are delighted to have her here

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,640
today. Uh she is also now known as

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,279
Professor Dame Fiona. Not only is she a

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,320
professor at MIT, but she was made a

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,560
dame of the realm uh for services to

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,600
science and technology and innovation

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,440
and keeping the world safe. Um she it

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,120
says on these slides that she's the vice

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,280
chair. She's actually just been elevated

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,399
to being the chair of the NATO

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,559
Innovation Fund. Um so round of applause

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,559
for that.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,480
>> Thank you. NATO Innovation Fund is the

16
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,399
alliance's venture capital fund. So if

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,039
you think venture capital's tricky,

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,120
imagine doing it with multistakeholder,

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,320
multi- sovereign members. And Fiona is

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,840
the chair uh of that organization. Uh

21
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,720
her topic for this afternoon is

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,400
innovation in an era of geopolitics. So

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,479
Fiona, thank you very much for joining

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,240
us from what looks like your home. And

25
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,799
with that, without further ado,

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,799
Professor Fiona Murray,

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,280
take it away.

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,119
Brilliant. Thank you, Phil. Um, and it's

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,799
very nice to be able to connect to

30
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,159
everybody. I'm sorry not to be able to

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,840
be there in person. Um, I was in London,

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,080
gosh, last week and I have to be there

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,079
again next week and so I'm sorry I

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,799
couldn't actually sort of stay over, but

35
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm really pleased that the technology

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,119
uh MIT can deliver some technology

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,880
around the world and and I can get to

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,720
join you and I think you're also in

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,600
incredibly good hands. Phil is a

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,680
longtime MIT colleague and co-author and

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,240
so if there are any difficult questions

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,200
we will definitely direct them to him.

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,040
Um as he kindly said I'm I'm an MIT

44
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,360
professor. Uh I've had the privilege of

45
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,960
being on the faculty at MIT for about 25

46
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,799
years. I'm in the management school

47
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,360
although originally I'm a scientist and

48
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,520
technologists by training. uh and so I

49
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,040
care very deeply about deep tech and how

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,520
we make sure that the investments that

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,760
we make in science and technology really

52
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,239
turn into the sorts of impacts that we

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,599
want uh in today's I think very complex

54
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,360
geopolitical world. Phil also mentioned

55
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,319
I've become chair of the NATO innovation

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,640
fund. This is a billion euro uh venture

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,480
capital fund uh where we have 24

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,160
contributing nations as our limited

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,480
partners and we're focused on making

60
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,560
early stage investments in companies

61
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,000
focused on defense security and

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,000
resilience across uh European nations.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,120
We do direct investing and we also help

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,040
build invest funds uh particularly in

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,560
parts of Europe where capacity needs to

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,560
be built to really do additional

67
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,160
investment. And I hope that the reason

68
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,879
why I'm doing that sort of in a sense

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,800
becomes clear uh when I go through this

70
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,879
presentation. And so I really wanted to

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,280
talk about innovation in an era of

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,280
geopolitics uh because I think that has

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,280
become a very important theme and I hope

74
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,680
it helps us tie some of the threads

75
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,040
together that Steve Whitaker and his

76
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,599
colleagues have so sort of nicely

77
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,599
orchestrated for all of you. And next

78
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,599
slide.

79
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,800
So I don't think you need me to describe

80
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,560
that we are in an era of geopolitics. I

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,040
think we're in a quite increasingly

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,879
fragmented world. Uh there we definitely

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,560
have the rise and fall of great power

84
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,920
competition and I would argue that we're

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,879
definitely in a phase where that is

86
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,400
rising. Uh or I'm not sure we're at peak

87
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,560
great power competition but we

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,640
definitely have I think a very clear

89
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,239
sort of sense of a more complex

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,239
relationship between the United States

91
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,239
and China um in general terms uh in

92
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,319
military terms but also in technological

93
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,239
terms. We also know that the war in

94
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,159
Ukraine is incredibly important in sort

95
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,040
of shaping the world and particularly in

96
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,040
Europe I think shaping how we understand

97
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,319
um the importance of defense and

98
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,920
security and we see that Europe is I

99
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,920
think asking itself a lot of questions

100
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,080
about having really a new geopolitical

101
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,760
compass you know how do we think about

102
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,159
the relationship between our individual

103
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,760
nations um sort of collective

104
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,200
sovereignty as opposed to individual

105
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,760
sovereignty whether that's through the

106
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,920
scaffolding of organ of alliances like

107
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,920
the European Union or NATO, Orcus, we

108
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,919
have a number of these different sort of

109
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,680
collective sovereignty sort of

110
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,800
scaffolding on which we might think

111
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,639
about develop developing. Um, and this I

112
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,000
think is a very significant shift away

113
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,840
from a much more sort of globalized

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,880
period that we've lived through for the

115
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,720
for the pri prior you know multiple

116
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,479
decades. Next slide.

117
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,400
And I think more today, more than any

118
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,400
other period, um, innovation and

119
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,080
industrialization are in the spotlight

120
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,240
for policy makers and for decision

121
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,040
makers. And they're in the spotlight in

122
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,880
part because of geopolitics, but also

123
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,800
they're seen as an input into some of

124
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,199
the solutions. innovation and

125
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,520
industrialization as these twin engines

126
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,080
I think are absolutely essential to how

127
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,479
we're going to to continue to drive the

128
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,560
economic growth that matters but also to

129
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,080
produce some of the outcomes that matter

130
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,759
whether those be perhaps some of the

131
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,520
traditional social missions that we care

132
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,759
deeply about like healthare um climate

133
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,759
and so on but also increasingly I think

134
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,919
are seen as essential inputs into our

135
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,320
national security and that I think is

136
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,240
the new part of this conversation and

137
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,520
again why why is it that, you know,

138
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,199
we're seeing innovation and

139
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,080
industrialization and where does it show

140
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,080
up? It shows up in our understanding of

141
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,000
um how the war in Ukraine is being

142
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,880
fought and the role of innovation in

143
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,800
that war. It's certainly showing up

144
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,800
every time the US makes a move that's

145
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,960
focused around a particular company, a

146
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,960
particular industrial sector and I would

147
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,720
say especially in the US response to

148
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,120
some of the issues around rare earth

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,199
mineral needs. We're seeing both the use

150
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,520
of new tools and particularly private

151
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,919
sector capital related tools like equity

152
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,919
loans and offtake agreements but also

153
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,840
when it comes to just really paying

154
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,120
attention to sectors and parts of the

155
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,840
supply chain that we've never done

156
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,080
before. We see it in the debates I think

157
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,160
on in on the European side of the

158
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,120
Atlantic a real sort of question about

159
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,360
this issue of US sort of dependency on

160
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,520
US technology. I think we actually saw

161
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,759
it in a quite interesting way in the

162
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,639
response to the sort of announcements

163
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,639
between the US and the UK uh in the most

164
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,120
recent visit of President Trump uh to

165
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,360
Britain. On the one hand, I think a real

166
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,039
enthusiasm for um the willingness of

167
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,960
companies like Nvidia and others to

168
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,400
invest in the United Kingdom, but on the

169
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,759
other hand, a question about whether or

170
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,759
not we can or should have a little more

171
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,440
independence or sovereign to use that

172
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,919
word ability to deploy AI in particular

173
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,919
at various places in the stack and what

174
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,360
that how that might be manifest. What

175
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,600
would we need to do for that to happen

176
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,680
and should we does it does it matter?

177
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,560
And then of course it's not just about

178
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,199
the US and Europe or the US and China. I

179
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,280
think um middle powers if you like

180
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,039
Africa the Middle East and so on very

181
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,520
very important players particularly in

182
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,000
this geoeconomic world when we know an

183
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,240
enormous amount of capital in particular

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,240
uh in the Gulf States is extremely

185
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,080
relevant I think to these debates and

186
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,560
enormous markets and growing and

187
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,599
expanding markets in Africa.

188
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,840
Next slide. So why this turn towards

189
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,919
innovation and industrialization? I

190
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,599
think some of you possibly may have

191
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,520
heard from me or from Phil in the past

192
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,160
and we have spent a lot of time talking

193
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,560
about um innovation and the world I

194
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,440
think that we might have described until

195
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,240
quite recently was really focused on

196
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,919
innovation ecosystems in very specific

197
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,479
places sort of intertwined embedded in

198
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,759
an almost invisible globalized supply

199
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,400
chain. Now 2005 Thomas Freriedman wrote

200
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,000
a book called the world is flat. Phil is

201
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,759
another historian I think was quite

202
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,400
offended by that because he was writing

203
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,400
a a brief history of the 21st century

204
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,680
only five years in probably three years

205
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,680
in because it took him a while to

206
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,680
publish and he effectively said that

207
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,240
sort of innovation ideas connectivity

208
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,240
was global and at least with respect to

209
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,039
innovation I think we recognized that

210
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,240
that probably was a poor representation

211
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,639
of the reality on the ground and that

212
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,400
even at that time and certainly by today

213
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,199
it's clear that for innovation the world

214
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,680
isn't flat It's actually highly

215
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,840
distributed across the world but in very

216
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,560
very dense locations that we would refer

217
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,120
to as innovation ecosystems places in

218
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,199
the world where the key stakeholders the

219
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,120
entrepreneurs the risk capital providers

220
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,479
and the universities come together with

221
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,159
corporations and government that

222
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,719
multistakeholder model that I think

223
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,200
you've seen and particularly for the

224
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,480
early stages of innovation the early

225
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,920
part of the idea to impact journey it

226
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,600
was these places in the world where we

227
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,880
see huge concentration

228
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,440
of talent, of capital, of ideas, and

229
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,600
often of sophisticated early customers.

230
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,360
Silicon Valley is perhaps iconic. At

231
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,440
MIT, we like to think of Greater Boston

232
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,279
and Kendall Square as as sort of the

233
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,240
ultimate quite specialized innovation

234
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:07,360
ecosystem with deep deep expertise in

235
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,880
ideas in the life sciences, in robotics,

236
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,320
um, and increasingly in some of the

237
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,440
climate technologies, particularly

238
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,279
around batteries and so on.

239
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,519
And Phil and I recently wrote a book to

240
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,680
put those Oh, go back one. I wanted to

241
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,000
talk about our book. Don't move forward

242
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,320
yet. So, we've written recently written

243
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,880
a book accelerating innovation, which

244
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,560
really asks the question, how do large

245
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,360
organizations, whether it be global

246
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,080
corporations or governments, tap into

247
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,320
that early uh innovation activity, that

248
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,839
that private sector ingenuity happening

249
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,399
at universities, but then particularly

250
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,399
out in spinouts and startups. And we

251
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,080
would have I think argued that all of

252
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,160
this was embedded in these very global

253
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,839
supply chains. And I'm just have an

254
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,680
image here of the semiconductor supply

255
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,519
chains which just remind us of how

256
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,760
global the production of these ideas

257
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,839
really was uh when it when they were

258
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,959
taking place at scale. And the common

259
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,320
narrative would have been to an

260
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,920
entrepreneur, you know, be focused in an

261
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,519
ecosystem, find the right partners and

262
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,839
then scale up as quickly as efficiently

263
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,600
as you can. Use the global manufacturing

264
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,120
and production network. Don't worry

265
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,320
about where that is in the world. And

266
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,800
also don't worry about where your

267
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,480
capital comes from or your talent. It's

268
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,079
really focusing on that early stage of

269
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,640
innovation.

270
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,600
But as you'll see in the next slide,

271
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,320
uh what we are beginning to recognize is

272
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,360
that you know innovation in particular

273
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,279
is expanding beyond us and allies. So

274
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,120
these innovation ecosystems, the places

275
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,279
in the world who can innovate are

276
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,519
expanding and supply chains themselves

277
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,920
are becoming a source of power. And it's

278
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,279
really these two shifts that together I

279
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,560
think put innovation and

280
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,399
industrialization together on the stage

281
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,200
and are deeply influential and

282
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,200
influenced by geopolitics. So taking the

283
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,800
first piece of the puzzle uh I think

284
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,079
that this is the first time the US has

285
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,320
faced a real peer adversary um with

286
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,640
comparable expertise across a very wide

287
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,640
range of technological domains. You

288
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,279
might have argued that the US is perhaps

289
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,000
the the leading nation around technology

290
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,160
and innovation. um would have had

291
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,399
competition sometimes from friendly

292
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,399
allies um and potentially from

293
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,079
adversaries in very narrow areas of

294
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,320
technology and I think about say Russia

295
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,760
with nuclear technology but really I

296
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,880
think today is one of the first times

297
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,640
that we've really seen a peer adversary

298
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,440
with comparable expertise across an

299
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,279
incredibly wide range of domains. We I

300
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,560
could pick numerous examples but this

301
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,320
chart just looks at some of the

302
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,360
comparative patents for something like

303
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,120
battery storage, hydrogen, bio energy.

304
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,839
um and you really start to see sort of

305
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,399
the rise of of um knowledge production

306
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,920
and early innovation in China. I think

307
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,120
the story that we've told ourselves for

308
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,040
a long time is that that was just

309
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,800
imitation and I think all the evidence

310
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,360
is pointing to the fact that China is

311
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,560
indeed innovating very directly and

312
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,399
itself has learned from the US playbook

313
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,480
and learned from that ecosystem playbook

314
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,640
to really build very vibrant innovation

315
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,320
ecosystems. And so we have competition

316
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,480
at the level of the early stages of

317
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,320
innovation. But the second piece is the

318
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,880
industrialization piece that

319
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,639
increasingly the fact that supply chains

320
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,079
were not actually evenly globally

321
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,000
distributed. They were highly

322
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,160
concentrated and remain highly

323
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,800
concentrated in places like Shenzhen and

324
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,200
China that has been very efficient for

325
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,720
the global economy. Shenzhen is as

326
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,800
specialized if you like in in

327
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,440
manufacturing and supply chains as say

328
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,040
Boston is in biotech. Um but these

329
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,440
supply chains are increasingly being

330
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,839
used as a source of power projection.

331
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,440
And so we see technological independ uh

332
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,839
interdependency

333
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,399
as a sort of source of power. And so we

334
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,800
start to worry about whether or not the

335
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,880
lack of of uh western and allied

336
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,560
capability industrialization is as

337
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,240
important as the debate and discussion

338
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,440
around innovation. Next slide.

339
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,120
I think we can see this more um sharply

340
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,440
than anywhere probably in the case of

341
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Ukraine and drones. So when we look at

342
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,720
Ukraine, we've often asked the question,

343
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,399
you know, what are the lessons uh from

344
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,240
Ukraine? And we often think about it in

345
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,920
terms of lessons in war fighting, right?

346
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,360
We think about how important it is to

347
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,600
have drones, to have mass, to have

348
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,760
autonomous systems, to be able to

349
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,160
operate in GPS denied environments and

350
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,839
so on. I would say let's ask some

351
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,680
economic and innovation lessons. And

352
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,680
what we see is I think one of the first

353
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,240
mo conflicts where a modern innovation

354
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,880
ecosystem is essential to the response

355
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,040
to conflict. And we actually see a whole

356
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,880
of society, whole of ecosystem response.

357
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,600
And we see an enormous amount of private

358
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,440
sector ingenuity of young people of risk

359
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,480
capital providers of universities all

360
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,040
leaning in to try to win the drone

361
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,880
startup war and to make sure that it's

362
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,120
really you know that that that

363
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,040
innovation and that ability to test and

364
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,200
evaluate incredibly quickly at the front

365
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,720
line that is providing Ukraine with some

366
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,800
of the advantage it so desperately

367
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,720
needs. And we also see Ukraine doing

368
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,279
that with a whole range of of other

369
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,760
startup and and scaleup companies uh

370
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,240
like Helsing coming from Germany, Tever

371
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,279
from Portugal, um Orion which is sort of

372
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,120
Swiss US and Anderil. Um and so this

373
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,399
very much is a sort of a startup

374
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,079
innovation ecosystem game and yet we've

375
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,079
also recognized that that's not quite

376
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,120
enough.

377
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:16,240
And so you'll see on the next slide that

378
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,800
um one of the challenges is a challenge

379
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,320
of accessing the drone supply chain. And

380
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,920
the challenge of accessing that supply

381
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,320
chain reminds us I think of the

382
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,240
essential role of industrialization.

383
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,920
And so Ukraine finds itself in a way

384
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,560
caught in the middle of USChina

385
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,399
hostilities as particular drone

386
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,120
components are are sort of being limited

387
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,600
in their availability to Ukraine where

388
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,040
American drone suppliers like Skyo for

389
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,800
example are having you know are

390
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,360
basically put on a Chinese sanction list

391
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,440
and being unable to access some of the

392
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,680
parts. And what you see on the right is

393
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,160
a chart based on some work I did with my

394
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,519
um colleague um Edlin Lavine where we

395
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,199
said well is it inevitable that um China

396
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,639
is the place where most of the core

397
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,560
components if you like if you the

398
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,440
anatomy of a drone if you look at the 12

399
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,120
components is it inevitable that they're

400
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,600
all produced in China. Well, it turns

401
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,920
out that it probably isn't. um the

402
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,000
origin of many of these deep

403
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,240
technologies whether it's uh the the

404
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,920
lithium polymer batteries some of the

405
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,360
brushless motors that are now on the

406
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,839
front page of the Wall Street Journal

407
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,920
the antenna and so on many of those were

408
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,959
developed in the US in Japan across

409
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,360
Europe uh in the UK but over time

410
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,959
because of this shift out of the

411
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,120
innovation phase into this sort of

412
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,360
industrialization phase where China was

413
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,760
specialized we've really seen this sort

414
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,079
of shift in the supply chain and we've

415
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,480
also seen been effectively a

416
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,760
vulnerability that's come from a lack of

417
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,839
manufacturing capacity and

418
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,839
industrialization. And so the real

419
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,680
debate now in Europe is to say, you

420
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,199
know, could we actually produce at

421
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,360
scale? Do we have the industrial

422
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,480
capacity? I think that debate is

423
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,800
becoming as loud and as as relevant not

424
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,000
only for sort of domestic job creation

425
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,759
but also frankly as having um you know

426
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,199
thinking of our industrial base as a

427
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,639
form of deterrent and I think that's

428
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,240
extremely important particularly for

429
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,160
deep tech where we actually have to

430
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,839
physically make something. So it's not

431
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,440
enough to actually be good at the

432
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,000
digital piece if we can't make the

433
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,360
physical assets where the an AI of

434
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,759
course wraps around them to make them

435
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,360
intelligent and effective. We absolutely

436
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,399
have to get the supply chains and the

437
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,079
manufacturing right. Uh less we think

438
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,759
this is just a drone problem. Let's have

439
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,519
a look at some emerging industries. I'll

440
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,600
do this very quickly. But take the

441
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,199
example of fusion energy. There's a

442
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,959
tremendous excitement around a company

443
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,959
like Commonwealth Fusion Systems which

444
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,440
is an MIT spinout that we're incredibly

445
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,680
proud of. Uh which you know is on track

446
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,800
having raised several billion dollars as

447
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:44,639
a company on track to deliver commercial

448
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,279
scale fusion systems. Uh they they are

449
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,959
switching on in the next uh little while

450
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,560
uh their their pilot uh phase uh spark

451
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,480
in Fort Devons and then they will be

452
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,480
building ARC which is the commercial

453
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,240
phase but I just had the opportunity to

454
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,680
meet their sort of um and spend time

455
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,759
with their head of manufacturing and

456
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,199
production and she was talking about the

457
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,039
fact that they're really trying to ramp

458
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,360
up manufacturing production supply

459
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,439
chains and that's actually one of the

460
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,039
huge challenges

461
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,400
and the question you might say is well

462
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:13,919
all right so what do you need what are

463
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,919
the supply chains of the future that

464
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,400
we're going to need if we want to not

465
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,400
only be winners in the core technology

466
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,559
of fusion energy systems, but actually

467
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
in the industrialization of them. And

468
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,760
when you start to pick it apart, you've

469
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,839
got to be good at things like thin film

470
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,679
processing, at cryoplants, that means

471
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,919
keeping everything cold, something that

472
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,600
the UK is actually very good at, at

473
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,760
large metal alloys, at power

474
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,679
electronics. and and Edlin myself um one

475
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,120
of our students Rory and and Dan Bruner

476
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,720
who was the chief science officer at

477
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,120
Commonwealth Fusion started to sort of

478
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,039
map out does China actually already have

479
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,520
such an advantage in some of these areas

480
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,039
that it's um it will be important for us

481
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,120
to have a really clear industrial

482
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,360
strategy to catch up and this will need

483
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,720
to be a whole of allied approach that

484
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,720
there's it's very unlikely for this to

485
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,039
be a US solution that some of the key

486
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,120
technologies and the key supply chains

487
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,320
are likely to run through for example

488
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,320
Finland where they have some very

489
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,440
specific ific expertise the UK and

490
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,200
elsewhere, Germany um and so on. And so

491
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,240
thinking about this, thinking not just

492
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,679
about the innovation but the

493
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,360
industrialization is going to be

494
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,640
essential.

495
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,480
Uh next slide. Um I could do this for a

496
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,559
whole series of priority technologies. I

497
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,120
won't suffice to say that it's not just

498
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,200
the old i.e. drones, the new i.e.

499
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,919
fusion, but also industries in

500
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,919
transition. Again, think of batteries. I

501
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:37,919
think we took for granted that um

502
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:40,720
China is the place that today has really

503
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,039
deep scale and economies of scale in

504
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,559
lithium-ion batteries. Again, you might

505
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,480
see you might ask the question, why is

506
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,120
that? The story is an interesting

507
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,080
combination actually of very early stage

508
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,679
IP being generated in the United States

509
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,840
um but actually then being scaled in

510
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,160
China through an interesting combination

511
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,880
of very explicit technology transfer,

512
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,960
very explicit licensing and also

513
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,200
probably some sprinkling of industrial

514
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,440
espionage and all kinds of other things.

515
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,280
Um as well as some very careful kind of

516
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,919
and thoughtful use of financial

517
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,600
instruments as companies weren't able to

518
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,520
access the capital they needed in the

519
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,600
US. that capital being provided in

520
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,240
China. But the really important thing is

521
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,000
the market. So China did some really

522
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,880
interesting things around growing their

523
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,640
EV market. So they absolutely created a

524
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,000
scaled market and that allowed their

525
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,480
companies um like CL and BYD to really

526
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,799
get those economies of scale. And so the

527
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,080
questions I think we have to ask as

528
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,000
companies and as countries is can we

529
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,160
catch up in that technology? Probably

530
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,880
not. Can we actually catch a march on

531
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,039
the next generation? Yes, but that will

532
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,600
I think require our startups, our

533
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,200
investors, our corporations to be have

534
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,919
some quite sophisticated views on

535
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,160
geopolitics and our governments to have

536
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,919
I think a fairly clear view about the

537
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,039
kind of tools of economic statecraftraft

538
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,280
that they might want to use.

539
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,640
Next slide. So as a result, right, I

540
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,880
think geopolitics is entering the

541
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,400
boardroom. It's very hard for us, I

542
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,080
think, as any of those of us who are,

543
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,080
you know, non-executives who sit on

544
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,200
boards, who advise startups and

545
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,120
investors as well as large companies to

546
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,520
um, you know, we would be remiss if we

547
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,720
didn't ask about geopolitical risk. But

548
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,799
more importantly, I think about

549
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,039
geopolitical dynamics. I think more than

550
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,880
just a risk assessment, we have to

551
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,400
really think about the dynamics. And we

552
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,280
see this whether it's a company like

553
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,120
ARM, you know, being sold to SoftBank,

554
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,240
um, you know, and then not being able to

555
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,039
IPO, etc., or the sale kind of being

556
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,880
blocked or Intel selling a stake. You

557
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,480
know, you you think about the changing

558
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,480
government reaction to these things and

559
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,679
we know that as companies we absolutely

560
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,760
have to pay attention as leaders. Next

561
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,600
slide.

562
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,200
The thing we have to respond to is what

563
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,440
I would call the set of economic

564
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,679
statecraftraft tools that governments

565
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,280
are increasingly putting into place. And

566
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,240
those statecraftraft tools might include

567
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,840
things that promote market. So offtake

568
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,840
agreements of the kind that we saw in

569
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,760
the US with MP materials um or the kind

570
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,440
of offtake that Google is doing with

571
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,240
Commonwealth Fusion advanced market

572
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,760
commitments um potentially reducing the

573
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,600
regulatory burden of deployment of

574
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,080
particular technologies more targeted

575
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,080
R&D support but also more sort of let's

576
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,960
say protectionoriented you could call

577
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,960
them protectionist more control of the

578
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,600
inputs and outputs of economic growth so

579
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,280
things like CPHAS in the US uh the

580
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,760
national security investment act in the

581
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,120
UK, the changing tariff landscape and

582
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,640
really things like export control

583
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,640
regulations that we used to think of as

584
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,720
this really specialized subject and I

585
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,240
think now is becoming more relevant. And

586
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,080
then the third piece of this is the

587
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,480
partnership the sort of state craft in

588
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,280
the context of partnerships. Is this all

589
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,840
going to be uh evolve around sort of

590
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,200
bilateral partnerships like the UK US

591
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,559
tech prosperity deal US Saudi on AI or

592
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,200
is it really going to be around

593
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:03,280
multi-country agreements or um you know

594
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,880
the US with DFC and others around

595
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,559
minerals for peace or multilateral

596
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,039
initiatives kind of grounded in things

597
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,440
like NATO? I I think we don't know yet

598
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,600
but absolutely as executives and I know

599
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,880
that's who many of you are. This is

600
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,039
really what we're starting to think

601
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,880
about is what should that geopolitical

602
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,720
kind of compass look like for you?

603
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,799
What's the toolkit? What's the calculus

604
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,200
that you need to have and really

605
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,840
understand?

606
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,679
Next slide. So, just to really kind of

607
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,960
conclude, we need a toolkit to sort of

608
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,039
for you to sort of evaluate your

609
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,039
geopolitical calculus and we need tools

610
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,880
and methods to bring these ideas to

611
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,799
life. And I think we're beginning to see

612
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,280
things like scenario planning,

613
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,039
potentially the use of more war games,

614
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,919
tools that are traditionally the the

615
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,679
realm of military policy makers. But

616
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,600
what how do we think about sort of

617
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,159
sudden geopolitical shocks on our supply

618
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,760
chains, on our industrial base co

619
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,520
started to bring that front and center,

620
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,360
but I think we need to do more of that.

621
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,919
What's our preparedness analysis? How do

622
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,760
we use simulation? And how do we have a

623
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,159
serious discussion in the boardroom um

624
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,720
about these topics?

625
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,559
Uh next slide.

626
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,000
So I think I just want to underscore

627
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,480
that I believe this is relevant for

628
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,720
large established corporations. You know

629
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,440
Apple can't ignore the trade the trade

630
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,280
war. Um its investors can't either. Its

631
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,960
exposure to China is quite significant.

632
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,480
And in fact if you look at the efforts

633
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,080
that they have made I think very

634
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,000
reasonably to shift production and

635
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,159
industrialization to India that's

636
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,520
extremely difficult. And we see the same

637
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,440
thing with TSMC moving to um moving to

638
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,039
the US. You know, these are very hard

639
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,880
things to do and we can't sort of shift

640
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,280
those in very short order, but we have

641
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,440
to have a calculus for understanding it.

642
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,039
Um likewise with small companies, you

643
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,200
know, whether it's the small companies

644
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,799
in the what used to be a rather obscure

645
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,400
part of the mining industry in rare

646
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,960
earth suddenly becoming front and

647
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,679
center. Are you a drone company? Are you

648
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,360
engaged in fusion or quantum? Um our

649
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,280
friends at Oxford Ionics I think were

650
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,559
delighted with the outcome of the

651
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,159
acquisition by INQ on the other hand you

652
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,799
know that's something that is going to

653
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,559
suddenly invoke uh the national security

654
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,240
investment act and so really

655
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,120
understanding these dynamics is I think

656
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,120
for the entire stakeholder uh

657
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,720
environment and all five of the

658
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,960
stakeholders that I think Phil will have

659
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,919
talked to you about absolutely got to

660
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,919
have this front and center.

661
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,600
Next slide. So I think lastly just

662
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,279
having a clear geopolitical calculus in

663
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,360
the boardroom I think matters today more

664
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,880
than ever. I spend a lot of my time kind

665
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,600
of working on this whether it's at the

666
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,520
level of the NATO innovation fund um

667
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,600
working with individual companies

668
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,520
thinking about this on campus at MIT it

669
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,720
affects universities as well on both

670
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,039
sides of the Atlantic. Um but this is I

671
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,520
think very much um the backdrop against

672
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,200
which many of our really key investment

673
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,520
decisions and resource allocation

674
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,600
choices are being made and it's it's a I

675
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,679
think a topic that's extremely important

676
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,840
and I'm really pleased I have a chance

677
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,520
to talk to you about it. So I think my

678
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,840
my last slide is going to be one that

679
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,159
just has a nice picture of MIT and I

680
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,919
just want to say thank you um and Phil

681
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,919
thank you for so wonderfully advancing

682
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,039
the slides. I'm really happy to answer

683
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,400
questions or um drop off or leave you to

684
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,919
answer all the questions. However you

685
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,480
would like to take our time together

686
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,000
forward.

687
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,919
>> Well, first of all, let's thank Fiona.

688
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,159
Fiona, can you hear me?

689
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,000
>> I can.

690
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,840
John, good. Well, we do have a few more

691
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,440
minutes before we do hand over. So,

692
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,840
because there may be tricky questions,

693
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,919
they're all yours. Um earlier we were

694
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,320
using a digital app called Pigeon Hole.

695
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,720
Um but I'm going to go old school. Uh we

696
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,840
have one with no votes from Mr.

697
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,240
Anonymous or Ms. anonymous. Uh, as your

698
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,080
diplomatic advisor, answer carefully.

699
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,279
Uh, what do you think of the UK

700
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,279
industrial strategy, Fiona?

701
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,919
>> The

702
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,520
>> the new one.

703
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,760
>> The new one. I was just going to say I

704
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,440
mean we Gosh, now my head is I can see

705
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,720
through the thing. My head is gigantic

706
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,679
on the screen. All right.

707
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,000
>> No, it's a just a trick of the light.

708
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,080
>> Thank you. I mean look I think the

709
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,520
government has you a s series of

710
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,679
governments one after another have

711
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,559
developed industrial strategies I I

712
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,720
think it's important that we have them

713
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,720
um know quite often people have said

714
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,320
look the US doesn't do industrial policy

715
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,840
we don't have an industrial strategy we

716
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,240
always have actually done industrial

717
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,480
policy um sometimes it just might be

718
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,720
quite lacair and at other times I think

719
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,279
it might be sort of all all-encompassing

720
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,080
and use this very wide set of tools of

721
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,960
economic statecraft um so I think think

722
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,760
it's important that the UK does that. I

723
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,559
um I think the thing that's difficult in

724
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,360
these strategies is both for a country

725
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,440
particularly the size of the UK uh I

726
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,520
don't think we need that slide but okay

727
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,480
perfect. Um, I think for a country

728
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,840
particularly the size of the UK, um, we

729
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,679
aren't going to be able to be good at

730
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,360
everything,

731
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,760
but we're not so small that we might

732
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,360
just pick one thing. And so I think we

733
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,039
sit in this rather uncomfortable middle

734
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,360
ground where the right number of things

735
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:04,080
for us as a country to excel at is

736
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,559
probably a handful of things. And that

737
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,039
requires prioritization and very um,

738
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,559
difficult choices. And I I see every

739
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,400
time governments struggling with where

740
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:14,000
they say a priority list and it'll have

741
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,360
17 things on it and and we all know

742
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,039
that's a shopping list and it's not

743
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,120
really a priority list because it's too

744
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,279
many things. And so I think that we need

745
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,039
to be a little bit more clear either

746
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,279
about the priority industries or frankly

747
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,240
the priority capabilities

748
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,320
and then really um try to make sure that

749
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,840
we continue to build the underlying

750
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,480
foundations. And so I would call those

751
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,559
the the talent piece of the puzzle, uh

752
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,039
the capital piece of the puzzle and and

753
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,919
the bit that I think is still difficult

754
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,200
in the UK is us as customer. The

755
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:44,799
government is a really important

756
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,760
customer particularly in areas like

757
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,600
defense and health and actually energy

758
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,440
and I do not believe that at the moment

759
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,760
we are using our buying power, our

760
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,000
customer power, our signaling power

761
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,960
particularly effectively. I think if we

762
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,520
were to do that better um it would be

763
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,440
much easier for us to really grow both

764
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,840
the startups, the scaleups and and

765
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,600
really support the large corporations

766
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,919
and their supply chains because we would

767
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,159
have more certainty about where markets

768
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,760
are going.

769
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,200
>> Excellent. Well, I think we're pretty

770
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,880
much at time. So, what I'm going to do

771
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,600
is walk across your your big in front of

772
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,960
your big head and put down the clicker.

773
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,240
Um the room has really enjoyed your uh

774
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,000
presentation this afternoon. I don't

775
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,600
know if you can feel that over the uh

776
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,240
communication system probably provided

777
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,679
by BT Fiber. Uh but the rumor has been

778
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,640
very positive about all this. So we're

779
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,760
going to give you a round of applause

780
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,760
and then turn to Steve. So thank you

781
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,760
Fiona.

782
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,919
>> My pleasure.
