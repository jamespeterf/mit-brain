00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,319
[Music]

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,160
so now I want to talk to you about the

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,200
Technologies we can use to measure gene

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,360
expression and gene expression programs

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,839
in single cells so we'd really like to

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,160
know what genes are being turned on in

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,439
each of these t- cell States so we have

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,279
this really uh amazing experimental

9
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:26,080
technology where we can take a group of

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,039
te- cells and apply a technology called

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,359
single cell RNA sequencing and read out

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,320
for every single cell what genes are

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,840
being expressed and to what levels

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,360
they're being

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,760
expressed so the output of the Single

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,920
Cell RNA sequencing experiment is this

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,520
gene expression Matrix where we've

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,399
measured the expression level of every

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,000
single Gene in every single cell and so

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,320
the rows of this Matrix are the

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,520
individual genes and there are 20,000

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,600
genes encoded in the human genome so

23
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,920
there's 20,000 rows in this Matrix and

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,000
the columns are the individual single

25
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,840
cells that we profiled so there's 50,000

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,320
columns because there were ,000 T cells

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,360
measured in this experiment now the

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,040
actual values in The Matrix are the

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,799
expression levels of the individual

30
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,439
genes inside a single cell so here we

31
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,000
can look at tcf7 and what this value

32
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:16,360
means three means that there are three

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,840
rnas that were counted from the gene

34
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,040
tcf7 in cell one but only zero RNA

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,560
molecules counted from tcf7 in cell

36
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,640
three and likewise we can look at the

37
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,600
Gene gzma and we find that there are

38
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,600
zero counts of RNA molecules in cell one

39
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,880
but three counts of RNA molecules from

40
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,600
gzma in cell

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,240
3 so once we have this gene expression

42
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,720
Matrix we can actually start clustering

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,240
cells together based on the Sim their

44
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,880
similarities in what genes they're

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,719
expressing so for instance we can see

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,040
cells one and two are similar to one

47
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,159
another because they both Express tcf7

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,119
and Bach 2 at high levels and they have

49
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,920
lower levels of all these other genes

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,600
likewise cells 3 and four Express prf1

51
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,799
in enzyme a gzma at high levels but they

52
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,439
have lower levels of all these genes and

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,799
finally cells five and six have high

54
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,080
expression levels of pdcd1 and

55
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,560
EES but they have lower levels of

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,400
expression of all these other genes here

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,239
and by clustering cells by their

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,200
similarities in the genes that they're

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,160
expressing we can actually identify the

60
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,879
programs and the cell States so if you

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,200
remember tcf7 and Bach 2 they Mark the

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,959
progenitor t- cell state in prf1 and

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,000
gzma mark the effector t- cell State and

64
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,680
finally pdcd1 and EES Mark the terminal

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,160
exhausted T cell state so from this data

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,959
we can really learn what the gene

67
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,800
expression programs are and remember

68
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,920
we're not just measuring two genes at a

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,920
time we're measuring all 20,000 genes

70
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,480
that could potentially be expressed in a

71
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,080
single cell so that's kind of the the

72
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,840
the output of a single cell RNA

73
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,000
sequencing experiment and we'll discuss

74
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,760
how this works momentarily but then the

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,040
other technology we'll discuss is um how

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,239
do we measure the effects of genetic

77
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,159
perturbations in single cells so why do

78
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,680
we want to do this so ultimately we want

79
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,760
to take t- cells in modify them in some

80
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,720
way make a perturbation in some way to

81
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,080
make them better at killing tumors

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,040
killing cancer cells because right now

83
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,760
te cells and cancer normally enter this

84
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,000
exhausted State this terminal exhausted

85
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,159
State and are unable to kill the cancer

86
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,280
so we really want Technologies to

87
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:19,599
measure the effects of perturbations in

88
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,080
te- cells so here's the t- cell

89
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,280
differentiation pathway we've seen

90
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,920
before and in this example we're just

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,000
going to change one gene this Gene

92
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,239
called to and we're going to delete it

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,640
from the t- cell and in general tox

94
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,599
deletion um strengthens the anti-tumor

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,799
te cell response so deleting this tox

96
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,640
Gene favors the progenitor te- cell

97
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,360
States and the effector t- cell States

98
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,879
over the terminal exhausted t- cell

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,080
state so we're going to introduce this

100
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:48,000
perturbation into the t- cells let the

101
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,840
cancers grow up in in the context of a

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,680
tumor and isolate the te- cells and then

103
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,239
do this technology called perturb seek

104
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,799
and we're going to Define perturb seek

105
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,000
in the later slides so the output of the

106
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:01,560
perturb seek experiment is again a gene

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,799
expression Matrix where we have all the

108
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,120
genes that are measured across the

109
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,159
single cells but we're also able to

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,599
detect the presence of the tox deletion

111
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,599
inside the single cells and the tox

112
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,040
deletion acts by affecting the

113
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,120
expression of many other genes and that

114
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,840
is going to shift the distribution of

115
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,320
the t- cell states to favor the

116
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,680
progenitor State and the affector state

117
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,080
and so now if we look at the gene

118
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,639
expression Matrix we still see uh the

119
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,160
genes that Mark progenitor t- cells and

120
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,840
affector t- cells but the genes that

121
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,120
Mark the terminal exhausted T Cell

122
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,160
states such as pdcd1 and EES their

123
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,320
expression level is close to zero and

124
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,000
that's because again this tox Gene is

125
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,919
affecting many genes and it's affecting

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,919
the distribution of the t- cell States

127
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,000
and so we no longer really are observing

128
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:50,400
the terminal exhausted t- cell state

129
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,720
after making the tox uh genetic deletion

130
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,199
these technologies have really taken off

131
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,440
in the last decade or so uh so what

132
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,680
we're looking at here are different uh

133
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,960
single cell RNA sequencing profiling

134
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,160
Technologies and these are uh on the

135
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,960
xais are the dates in which the studies

136
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,520
were published and the Technologies were

137
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,360
first demonstrated and on the Y AIS are

138
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,479
the number of cells that were profiled

139
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,120
in that uh by that technology and what

140
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,080
you'll notice actually is that the y-

141
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,840
axis is on the log scale so in 2009 the

142
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,639
first single cell RNA sequencing

143
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,720
experiment was performed this was on a

144
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,000
mouse Blaster mirror which is a four

145
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,520
cell stage embryo and that was the first

146
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,880
experiment done single cells and then

147
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,840
now or you know 5 years ago in 2017 we

148
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,039
reached the level where in a single

149
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,080
experiment we could profile 1 million

150
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,240
single cells so what this means is for 1

151
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,639
million single cells we could quantify

152
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,199
the expression level of all the 20,000

153
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,440
genes in those single cells so this is

154
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,680
really amazing growth and it's really

155
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,319
led to a revolution in many fields in

156
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,199
biology and it's also impacting our

157
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:57,080
studies of cancer immunology and cancer

158
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,080
immunotherapy so now let's talk about

159
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,840
how the Single Cell RNA sequencing

160
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,800
experiment really works so we always

161
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,360
start with a piece of tissue so in this

162
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,039
case it could be a tumor like melanoma

163
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,039
and that tissue gets taken out of the

164
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,120
patient and then the tissue is made up

165
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,639
of individual cells that are kind of

166
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,840
working together and communicating in

167
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,639
the context of that tissue environment

168
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,440
we take that tissue and we dissociate it

169
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,680
into the individual single cells and now

170
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,840
once the single cells are isolated we

171
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,680
want to extract their RNA and the RNA is

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,599
what tells us which genes are being

173
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,479
expressed in the cell and so by looking

174
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,280
at what RNA is inside the Single Cell we

175
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,560
can identify gene expression programs

176
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,840
and the cell states of these t- cells

177
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,240
that we extracted uh from the solid

178
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,639
tissue so I next want to give you an

179
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,440
overview of how we isolate the single

180
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,199
cells in the Single Cell RNA sequencing

181
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,240
experiment and label uh the transcripts

182
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,560
now this is really amazing and really

183
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,080
cool technology but the exact details of

184
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,160
how it works are not critical for your

185
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,599
ability to perform in this data science

186
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,280
challenge so let's get going so what

187
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:07,800
happens our single cells are isolated in

188
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,599
water droplets using microlitic Chambers

189
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,759
so this is a blow up of a microfluidic

190
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,879
chamber the cells are flown into the

191
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,319
chamber and they get encapsulated in

192
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,160
these droplets and you'll notice within

193
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,240
each droplet there's also these colored

194
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,199
beads and these colored beads are going

195
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,520
to help label the transcript from the

196
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,879
single cell and it will tell us which uh

197
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,000
cell that transcript came from so

198
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,039
remember trans scripts are just the RNA

199
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,160
that's being transcribed from the Gene

200
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,919
and now all these RNA molecules in these

201
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,680
single cells get labeled with different

202
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,639
barcode which is really like a a

203
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,240
different DNA sequence and here we have

204
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,400
cells labeled with a purple barcode a

205
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,199
blue barcode and a red barcode and now

206
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,599
when we read out those transcripts using

207
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,599
sequencing in the next slide we'll know

208
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,199
which cell each transcript came from and

209
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,199
so now let's go back to this earlier

210
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:57,879
cartoon I just explained to you how

211
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,479
single cells are isolated using

212
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:03,720
microfluidic and we're a to label the

213
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,479
RNA and then we take this RNA and we

214
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,520
actually reverse the process of

215
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:11,039
transcription so if you remember from

216
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,360
the introductory uh materials uh DNA is

217
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,039
transcribed or copied into RNA we can

218
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,800
actually reverse that process and make a

219
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,919
complimentary piece of DNA and we do

220
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,759
this because DNA is much more stable and

221
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,360
we can also make many copies of DNA and

222
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,120
which is useful because then what we're

223
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,080
going to do is sequence all those DNA

224
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,279
molecules that were dered from the RNA

225
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,479
and sequencing is literally just a

226
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,640
process of reading out the a c's and G's

227
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,760
that are going to Define that DNA and

228
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,120
once we have those sequences we can

229
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,120
actually identify What gene that

230
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,480
sequence came from because the entire

231
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,279
Human Genome uh was sequenced and we

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,160
know the sequence of all individual

233
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,160
genes so when we have a DNA sequence we

234
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,959
can look up What gene does it match to

235
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,640
in the human genome and that will tell

236
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:03,200
us that okay tcf7 was found in this cell

237
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,000
and pdcd1 was found in this other cell

238
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,920
and that's literally just by sequencing

239
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,720
out uh the DNA that comes from this

240
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,240
experiment and matching it against the

241
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,720
human genome and so the final outcome

242
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,519
then are these big gene expression

243
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,519
matrices and let's look at them in a

244
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,560
little more detail so to remind you

245
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:20,640
again the rows of this gene expression

246
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,800
Matrix are the genes and there's 20,000

247
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,440
genes we could measure and the columns

248
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,680
are the individual cells and here in

249
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,920
this experiment we've measured 70,000

250
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,480
cells and then the values are how much

251
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,720
each gene was expressed in every single

252
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,480
cell so tcf7 expressed level three in

253
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,480
cell one gzma expressed level zero in

254
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,640
cell one but level three in cell three

255
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:43,720
and so forth so what you notice as well

256
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,160
in this Matrix is that there are many

257
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Zer actually and this is not a surprise

258
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,200
because um there are many biological

259
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,360
reasons why a gene would be at level

260
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,680
zero in a Cell so remember all our cells

261
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,000
are defined by gene expression programs

262
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,279
and these gene expression programs don't

263
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,320
include all 20,000 genes they include

264
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,800
tens to hundreds of genes these gene

265
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,399
expression programs Define what the cell

266
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,480
is doing and all the other genes are

267
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,560
really not needed for what the cell

268
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,800
needs to do in the tissue context and so

269
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,079
they don't get expressed on purpose so

270
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,920
the level zero here is for a biological

271
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,800
reason however the zeros also can arise

272
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:25,079
from technical reasons because it's very

273
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,000
hard to actually capture all the RNA

274
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:29,560
that comes from a single cell so you can

275
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,040
imagine a single cell is very very small

276
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,959
it's on the order of 10 microns or so

277
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,760
and the rnas there's many of them and

278
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,839
being able to capture all of them is

279
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,360
difficult so sometimes you just fail to

280
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,920
capture the RNA and you get a zero in

281
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,760
that Matrix so once we have this gene

282
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,920
expression Matrix now we start to do

283
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,000
computational analysis to identify the

284
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,959
cell states that we're finding in this

285
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,120
experiment and there are several um

286
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,760
steps in the computational analysis

287
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,639
starting from quality control and

288
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,600
normalization of the data and then

289
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,480
feature ction dimensionality reduction

290
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,440
and clustering and so we're going to

291
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,959
walk through each of these steps so you

292
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,800
understand you know how we go from the

293
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,880
Gen expression Matrix to actually

294
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,320
identifying the cell states that are

295
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,560
there the gene expression programs and

296
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,279
learning you know what we actually see

297
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,160
in in the sample that we're profiling so

298
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,279
the first step in our single cell RNA

299
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,880
sequencing analysis is quality control

300
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,519
and the idea here is we want to remove

301
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,600
low quality data that we don't want to

302
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:30,040
work with and here I've ordered um all

303
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,440
the single cells by the number of genes

304
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,959
were detected in that cell and the

305
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,240
maximum for this AIS is 20,000 because

306
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,000
that's the number of genes in the human

307
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,519
genome so the cells are ordered by the

308
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,639
number of detected genes and you'll see

309
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,600
there are two taals to the distribution

310
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:46,120
and we uh focus on those two tails so

311
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,920
this tail here where a low number of

312
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,279
genes are being detected is often uh

313
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,519
found due to low quality cells that have

314
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,920
been damaged in the sequencing process

315
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,519
and so we remove those from analysis and

316
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,040
then this other tail here is often found

317
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,120
because the same single cells are

318
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,040
actually still stuck to one another when

319
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,600
they go into the droplet and so it's not

320
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,040
really a single cell we're looking at

321
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,560
but multiple cells and so we also remove

322
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,720
those from the downstream analysis after

323
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,720
that after we perform quality control we

324
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,320
then normalize the data so um uh why do

325
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,160
we normalize the data so if we look at

326
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,079
the total gene expression in a Cell we

327
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,079
find that that value often varies for

328
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:29,920
technical reasons and the total gene

329
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:32,120
expression in a Cell uh is just taking

330
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,720
the cell and looking at all the genes

331
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,680
that are expressed in that cell and

332
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,360
summing up all those values to get the

333
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,839
total level of gene expression in that

334
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,079
cell and we find that that total varies

335
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,279
quite a lot across cells and this is

336
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,639
often for technical reasons and if we

337
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,680
don't correct for this technical effect

338
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,160
this is a confounding factor in a lot of

339
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,240
our Downstream analysis so we end up

340
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,160
what we end up doing is for every cell

341
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,120
we normalize the total gene expression

342
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,079
so now the total gene expression is just

343
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,920
going to sum to one and then what we do

344
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,399
is we multiply all of that by 10,000 so

345
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,800
now this total expression sums to 10,000

346
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,720
we add one and take the logarithm and

347
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,279
this is a standard kind of approach

348
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,639
that's done in a lot of these uh

349
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,720
sequencing studies and the reason we're

350
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,440
going to be adding one is if you

351
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,360
remember a lot of these gene expression

352
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,519
values are zero so if you take the

353
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,760
logarithm of zero you know that's bad so

354
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,720
we add one to avoid doing

355
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,199
that so now we've done the normalization

356
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,040
we move on to uh the feature selection

357
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:33,240
step so I first want to start with this

358
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,600
cartoon of cells in this sort of

359
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,040
threedimensional space where the axes

360
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,360
are the expression levels how much each

361
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,040
gene is found inside those cells so we

362
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,880
have Gene one gene two and Gene three

363
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,600
and there's a group of cells here here

364
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,639
and here and they're kind of all in

365
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,920
these different kind of clusters where

366
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,519
you know these cells have hydrogene one

367
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,839
and two these have hyene one and three

368
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,720
and these have hyene two and three so

369
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,040
this is an understandable way to look at

370
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,399
cells and their gene expression however

371
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,040
unfortunately fortunately depending on

372
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,399
how you look at it cells actually exist

373
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,079
in 20,000 dimensional space where they

374
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,000
don't just Express three genes they

375
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:12,120
could express up to 20,000 genes so this

376
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,600
would be very hard to imagine like

377
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,600
humans cannot visualize higher

378
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,440
dimensional spaces however this is

379
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,839
really the dimensional this is really

380
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,079
the space in which the cells are

381
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,560
existing and so this is hard to

382
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:25,120
visualize it's also hard to work with

383
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,040
from a machine learning perspective it's

384
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,399
hard to Cluster things that are in very

385
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,000
high dimensional space

386
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,519
so what we do is we do feature selection

387
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,720
where we only focus on those genes or

388
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:39,800
features that have highly variable

389
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,519
expression across the cells and the idea

390
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,240
here is that genes that are variable in

391
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,880
expression are genes that are going to

392
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,480
explain the cell states that we're

393
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,000
seeing so let's think about a gene whose

394
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,839
expression level is the same across all

395
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,040
the cells we're seeing so that's not

396
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:56,720
going to help us differentiate a

397
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,199
progenitor t- cell from a terminally

398
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,839
exhausted T Cell because the Gene's

399
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,959
expression level is the same across

400
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,199
those States however if a gene is

401
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,160
variable meaning its expression is high

402
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:08,320
in one cell State and low in other cell

403
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,279
States that's actually informative about

404
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,800
what differentiates the cell States so

405
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:14,600
for instance you remember the TCF Gene

406
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,160
is highly expressed in the progenitor t-

407
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,000
cells but lowly expressed in the

408
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,920
terminally exhausted t- cells so that's

409
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,519
an example of a gene with variable

410
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,680
expression across the cells and so what

411
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:29,319
we do is we take these 20,000 genes and

412
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,240
we select the 2,000 to 5,000 most highly

413
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:33,040
variable genes and that's our feature

414
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,279
selection step and so at this point

415
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,360
we've gone from describing our data with

416
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:41,079
20,000 genes or features to 2,000 to

417
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,839
5,000 so this is a reduction in the

418
00:15:41,079 --> 00:15:46,040
dimensionality of the data and now we

419
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,560
can go even further with that so now

420
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,639
let's pretend or we can imagine that our

421
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,199
cells are in 5,000 dimensional space

422
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:53,800
after this feature selection and we want

423
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,360
to go even lower and we're actually

424
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,440
powered to do this because let's return

425
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,000
to the idea of our gene expression

426
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,600
programs so remember in the gene

427
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,600
expression programs you have groups of

428
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,680
genes that are turned on or off together

429
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,079
so if I have a gene expression program

430
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:12,440
that defin say the progenitor te- cells

431
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:14,199
if I tell you that you know um tcf7 is

432
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,720
high in these te- cells that actually

433
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:18,560
tells me a lot about all the other genes

434
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,480
that are are in that gene expression

435
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,399
program because they're turned on

436
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,920
together so knowing the expression level

437
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,000
of one gene actually tells me a lot

438
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,639
about many other genes that are being

439
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,759
expressed in that cell and so because of

440
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,399
that uh genes are really not independent

441
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,480
of one another measuring one gene can

442
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:38,040
tell you about many other genes and this

443
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,360
is really the key that allows us to go

444
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,959
to even lower dimensionality spaces when

445
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,800
describing our data and so uh a really

446
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:47,399
common technique is this linear

447
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,880
dimensionality reduction technique

448
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,519
principal component analysis or PCA um

449
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,920
and this allows us to move from

450
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:58,000
describing cells with 5,000 genes to uh

451
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,079
this new space where cells are described

452
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,399
with 10 to 100 principal component

453
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,760
scores where these principal components

454
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,600
are really reflecting the different gene

455
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,720
expression programs within the cells so

456
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,280
at this point now we've gone from 5,000

457
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,079
dimensional space to about 10 to 100

458
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,959
dimensions and this is a lot easier to

459
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:20,120
work with when it comes to clustering to

460
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,760
identify the T Cell

461
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,799
States so uh the last step in the

462
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,600
analysis is we've done this

463
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,679
dimensionality reduction using principal

464
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,360
components analysis and now we're going

465
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,200
to do graph based clustering so we're in

466
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,160
the principal component space and we're

467
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,200
going to calculate the distance between

468
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,120
every pairs of cells uh this is the

469
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,799
ukian distance between cell one and two

470
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,559
cell one and three and so forth for

471
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:46,799
every possible pairs of cells and then

472
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,640
we're going to use that distance Matrix

473
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,360
to build a k nearest neighbors graph so

474
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,919
here are the individual cells in sort of

475
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,640
this lower dimensional space that we've

476
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,600
moved into and we're going to ask for

477
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,240
every cell who are my K nearest

478
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,919
neighbors and we're going to build that

479
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,679
graph so for instance this cell the

480
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,400
nearest neighbors are here here and here

481
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,760
and we do that for every single cell and

482
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,000
we build that graph and now once we have

483
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,480
that graph we start to Cluster in that

484
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,159
graph space and you can already by I you

485
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,559
know where would you draw the Clusters

486
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,720
you would probably draw a cluster here

487
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:19,039
because there's a lot of connections

488
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,799
between these cells a cluster here and a

489
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,960
cluster here and there are many

490
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,640
clustering approaches out there uh one

491
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,039
of the most common clustering algorithms

492
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,360
is the lien algorithm and this is a

493
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:33,320
algorithm to detect communities within

494
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,520
graphs and this algorithm works by um

495
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,440
optimizing a metric called modularity

496
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,600
and so we do lien clustering and we

497
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,840
identify three clusters in this toy

498
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,080
example okay so at this point uh I've

499
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,000
gone over with you all the steps in a

500
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,360
typical single cell RNA sequencing

501
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,280
analysis we started with quality control

502
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,320
and normalization and then we went to

503
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,960
feature selection dimensionality

504
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,039
reduction and this graph based

505
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,240
clustering and now let's apply

506
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,880
everything we've learned to the actual

507
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,559
data that's in the data science

508
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,520
Challenge and so this is data collected

509
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,360
by um The Physician scientist Mark

510
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,679
Schwarz and uh near hakohen at the bro

511
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,000
and Dana Farber Cancer Institute and in

512
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,600
the challenge we have te- cells that

513
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,200
have been collected from mice with

514
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,840
melanoma and we're showing all the t-

515
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,799
cells in this plot here and this is

516
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,960
what's called a umap embedding and the

517
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:27,880
umap embedding is a visualization

518
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,360
approach to take high-dimensional data

519
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,480
which is existing in this High

520
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,360
dimensional space and showing it in a

521
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,880
nice two-dimensional plot and so the

522
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,400
umap embedding is calculated from those

523
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,440
principal component scores that we

524
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,480
introduced in the previous slides and

525
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,039
the idea with the umap embedding is it's

526
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,840
trying to preserve local distance uh

527
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:48,720
similarities so if two cells are similar

528
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,720
to one another in the high dimensional

529
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,280
space and by similar to one another I

530
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,919
mean that they have similar genes being

531
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,600
expressed so if they're similar in the

532
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:58,760
higher dimensional space then we want

533
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,799
them to be close to one another when we

534
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,280
visualize them in two Dimensions so what

535
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,320
this means is like these two blue dots

536
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,919
here that are really close to one

537
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,520
another in the high dimensional space

538
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,280
they were close to one another and so

539
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,720
when we plot them in two Dimensions we

540
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,679
want them to also be close to one

541
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,400
another so this is a separate embedding

542
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,919
that gets calculated and you can read

543
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,200
more about it here and it's calculated

544
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,679
from the principal components and then

545
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,120
we take that embedding of all the T

546
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,840
cells and now we color the t- cells by

547
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,440
uh the identity of the Clusters that we

548
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,760
learned in the previous slide so

549
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,120
remember in the previous slide we

550
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,440
identified about three clusters here we

551
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,960
have um e clusters and they're all

552
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,640
colored uh differently and uh what we

553
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,159
see is that there's this really strong

554
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,559
clustering in the data where these t-

555
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,919
cells look like they're one cluster and

556
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:43,520
these t- cells look like they another

557
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:45,919
cluster and this is really what's going

558
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,440
to lead us to identifying what the te

559
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,960
cells are doing so the idea is that te

560
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,679
cells in this cluster are having one set

561
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,000
of gene expression programs that's

562
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,039
distinct from t- cells in this cluster

563
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,600
over here and so to get at that uh we

564
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,480
start to look look at what genes are

565
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,679
being expressed in each of these cells

566
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,799
so remember every single cell here in

567
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,919
theory we have up to 20,000 genes

568
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:10,320
measured so we can take cells in one

569
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,679
cluster and ask what genes are more

570
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,880
highly expressed in this cluster

571
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,360
relative to all the other clusters so

572
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,520
for instance if we take the progenitor

573
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,480
t- cells in this um kind of brownish

574
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,159
orange color we can ask what genes are

575
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,480
more highly expressed and so what we

576
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:27,760
would see or what we do see in the

577
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,760
actual data is the gene tcf7 is higher

578
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,400
in this cluster relative to all the

579
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,360
other clusters and that Clues Us in that

580
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,320
this t- cell cluster is actually

581
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,760
reflecting the progenitor t- cell State

582
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,360
and we can label it progenitor likewise

583
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,240
if we go over to this cluster of t-

584
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,279
cells over here and we look at what

585
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,200
genes are more highly expressed meaning

586
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:49,480
they're higher levels than all the other

587
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,000
clusters we see the gene pdcd1 coming up

588
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,279
and remember this is a gene that marks

589
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,039
the terminal exhausted t- cell state so

590
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,440
by doing this game for every single

591
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,880
cluster we can actually annotate every

592
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,919
cluster and say what T Cell State uh

593
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,799
these cells belong to and what's really

594
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,559
beautiful is that we see all the t- cell

595
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,400
states that we would expect to see in

596
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,480
the context of a cancer in this case

597
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,200
melanoma so we see those progenitor t-

598
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,120
cells we see the uh affector t- cells we

599
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,159
see the terminal exhausted t- cells and

600
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,200
we see the cycling T cells so um at this

601
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:22,600
point you know now you have an

602
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,240
understanding of how single cell RNA

603
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,559
sequencing works and how we can take a

604
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,960
population of cells measure the gene

605
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,960
expression program within the single

606
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:32,640
cells and with some analysis identify

607
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,200
the gene expression programs and the

608
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,039
length cell States for those single

609
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,120
cells so the next problem that we really

610
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,360
want to solve is what happens when we do

611
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,840
genetic perturbations uh to the te-

612
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,760
cells and how does that affect the gene

613
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,640
expression programs and again the reason

614
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,480
we care about this is because currently

615
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,279
uh regular te- cells enter this

616
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,360
exhausted State and are unable to kill

617
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,520
the tumor so we really need to make some

618
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,400
change to the te- cell to enable it to

619
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,640
better kill the tumor to kill cancer

620
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,799
cells so what we would like are

621
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,640
technologies that allow us to test

622
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:05,679
perturbations in cells and see what

623
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,480
happens uh to the gene expression of

624
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,480
those cells and the resulting cell

625
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,480
States

626
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:14,079
