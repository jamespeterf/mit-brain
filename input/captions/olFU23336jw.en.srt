with your audience about well my work

82
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,959
and the history of how I arrived where I

83
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,120
am now. And this is just a a little part

84
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:16,959
of professional life of of a scientist.

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,599
So if you permit me, I am I will uh

86
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,080
propose to start my conversation just

87
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:26,000
sharing some slides about my in

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,519
institute. I'm interested to uh for you

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,239
all to know what my institute is about

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:39,599
and some other um insights about the

91
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:41,280
work that we do in my group. Um so at

92
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,519
the ICGE

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,239
uh this is the international center for

94
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,560
genetic engineering and biotechnology

95
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,200
and we are an intergovernmental

96
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,159
organization that is working in the

97
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,799
intersection between uh research

98
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,599
training and technology transfer in life

99
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,080
sciences with the goal of promoting

100
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,560
sustainable development uh the

101
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,080
sustainable global development and we

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,400
began as uh

103
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,640
we began as an special project of

104
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,120
UNIDOM. This is the United Nation um uh

105
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,199
office for the industrial development.

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,960
And then almost what yeah 40 years ago

107
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,600
uh we became 30 years ago we became an

108
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,720
independent organization fully

109
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,160
independent but still we operate within

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:39,360
the United Nations systems. We follow

111
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:42,320
many of its administrative procedures

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,720
and as an intergovernmental organization

113
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,680
we are made by the network of almost 70

114
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,800
member states countries and our

115
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,120
laboratories are hosted in Africa in

116
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:01,440
Italy where I am now in South Africa and

117
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,440
also in India and yeah I I will be happy

118
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,000
to see many other Latin American

119
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,039
countries and from Africa and from the

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,080
global south to join this uh group of

121
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,120
country and to complete this map. And

122
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,400
the ICGB is governed by a board of

123
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,840
governor and with one representative of

124
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,199
each member state and this board meets

125
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,400
every year to help guide our direction

126
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,600
of the institute and in many ways this

127
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,560
function like a mini united nation like

128
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,240
a General Assembly of the United Nation,

129
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:41,680
but for biotechnology, bringing bringing

130
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,880
diverse national perspective together in

131
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,080
a with a spirit of collaboration.

132
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,360
And um our work is organized around six

133
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,680
core pillars that you can see here in

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,080
this list.

135
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,880
And in addition, we focus on

136
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,720
crosscutting priorities such as gender

137
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,039
and jobs, south cooperation and with a

138
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,440
strong focus on the least developed

139
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:11,120
countries

140
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,520
and our instrument of actions are these

141
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,400
six that you can see here to deliver our

142
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,360
mission. So the first one is about the

143
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,370
research in our laboratories and this is

144
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,639
just a very

145
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,479
[Music]

146
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:29,280
short summary of our diversity on on the

147
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,160
research part on infectious diseases

148
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,440
non-communic non-communicable diseases

149
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,639
and these are the group that are

150
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,880
distributed between our three components

151
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:44,080
in again Italy South Africa and India

152
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,199
medical biotech industrial bio biotech

153
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,600
and uh and also plant biology and

154
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:54,000
biotechnology.

155
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:58,800
And in this last group is where my

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,039
groups has been assigned. Okay.

157
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,520
So, and we also work with a council of

158
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,479
scientific advisors that they provide

159
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,599
with advice. to how to run our

160
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,199
institution and it's made by uh

161
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,919
well-renowned

162
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,919
scientific personalities including Nobel

163
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,039
Prizes

164
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:23,039
and and then the other four instrument

165
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:26,560
of actions are fellowships. This slice

166
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,560
is not updated. Sorry for that. But uh

167
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,160
constantly we have many calls for

168
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,759
fellowships, PhD and postto fellowships

169
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,560
and also for short-term fellowship for

170
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,639
people from our member states to come

171
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,000
national from our member state to come

172
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,479
to our laboratories to perform a part of

173
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,240
of their research.

174
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:53,440
Um we also help to organize help

175
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,680
providing financial help uh for

176
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,560
researcher again in our member state to

177
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,440
organize meeting and courses and also we

178
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,440
provide uh grant research for

179
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,599
researchers located in our member

180
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,520
countries to perform their research

181
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:13,639
there with a with a a relevant context

182
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,639
no in national context.

183
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,879
Um we also have a text transfer and

184
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:22,080
biotech development unit to develop uh

185
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,440
bio similars with pharma compliance

186
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,599
laboratories and premises. And the last

187
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,160
but not the least instrument of action

188
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:33,279
is technical assistance and again this

189
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,599
is where my group uh is working the

190
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,800
technical assistant for the regulation

191
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:44,240
of biotech and its program. So this is

192
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:47,760
the ICG regulatory science group and we

193
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,920
support countries and organization

194
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,440
agencies in the safe regulation of

195
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,399
biotechnology

196
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,959
and we work to build uh to build and

197
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,320
also strength systems that can

198
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,480
effectively identify, assess, manage and

199
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,839
monitor biotech products especially in

200
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,600
the face of the emerging

201
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,320
biotechnologies.

202
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,120
And we organize our activities into

203
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,959
three main uh areas. Capacity

204
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,279
development, knowledge and policy

205
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,800
engagement and diagnostic and applied

206
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,279
projects.

207
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,959
For in the case of capacity development,

208
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,480
we uh most of our work is focused on

209
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,399
institutional

210
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,880
capacity uh development. For instance,

211
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,440
development uh developing or updating

212
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,200
biosafety legislation and regulatory

213
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,959
systems.

214
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,360
some example and also strengthening

215
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,160
institutional policy for the safe use of

216
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,480
emerging bio technologies. This is a

217
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,680
some example of our recent projects and

218
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,600
also the individual capacity uh building

219
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,519
activities that we provide um organize

220
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
and provide international workshops on

221
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,399
environmental assessment of genetically

222
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,279
modified organism and we have developed

223
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,959
and we are developing constantly an ICG

224
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,120
e-learning platform

225
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,240
in the area of knowledge and policy

226
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,640
engagement. Uh

227
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,519
we produce we make desk research we

228
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,279
produce derative reviews on biosafety

229
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:26,000
legislation.

230
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:29,519
uh and also we produce great deterative.

231
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,480
We write reports for UN agencies as this

232
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:36,000
one on synthetic biology or policy

233
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,240
briefs to uh address to international

234
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,360
and global leaders and also we

235
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,920
participated in several policy dialogues

236
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,680
for biocurity governance and strategic

237
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,320
foresight um or more recent this more

238
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,640
esoteric part of biotech that is called

239
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,200
mirror lives and uh a small part of our

240
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,240
activities devoted to diagnostics and

241
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,720
applied projects. This is something that

242
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,880
we have recently implemented in Africa

243
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,440
for strengthening the um surveillance um

244
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,000
uh epidemiology of public health

245
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,440
laboratories in Africa. And this is my

246
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
group. We are today just four groups.

247
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,959
This is my supervisor Wendy Craig and my

248
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,800
other two colleagues. and we rely our

249
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,519
extensive

250
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:30,959
network of collaborator for filling any

251
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:35,040
gaps that we might have in our projects.

252
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:38,320
So that's it. Uh that's it. That was uh

253
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,839
short and quick. Uh but I hope that that

254
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,600
provides you guys with a a very broad

255
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:48,800
idea of what my organization is and what

256
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,880
more or less we are doing in my group.

257
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,680
And I will be happy to discuse for the

258
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:58,880
rest of the time about what I told you

259
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:03,440
or any other uh issue about biotech and

260
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:05,760
present and uh interesting topic or

261
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,880
future interesting topic of course of

262
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,160
biotech.

263
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,519
>> We are joined by uh three students from

264
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,040
the broad summer scholars program and uh

265
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,200
they have prepared a list of questions

266
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,360
ahead of time to facilitate the

267
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,519
conversation. So, Maggie, uh, would you

268
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,200
kick us off, please?

269
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,279
>> Yeah. So, the first question we'd like

270
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,680
to ask is, what first sparked your

271
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,600
interest in biology and how did that

272
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,160
interest grow into a career in science

273
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,399
and policy?

274
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,040
>> Yeah.

275
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,399
Okay. Uh,

276
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,720
I mean there many things, many things. I

277
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,760
mean, this is something now in in

278
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,440
retrospective. Uh

279
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,639
I can think that I mean I always

280
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,959
was fascinated by living things and by

281
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,839
science and perhaps this is not it was

282
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,399
not unique for me because I think that

283
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,160
any child is fascinated by living

284
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,800
things. Uh but I remember no to be very

285
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,639
mesmerized of how plants grow and how

286
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,200
insects behave and how our bodies work.

287
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,600
And I remember I was watching Animal

288
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,440
Planet and discovered a channel instead

289
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,079
of MTV or Cartoon Network or some

290
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,880
something like that. And but that was

291
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,880
something that I bring with me for the

292
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,320
rest of my life. No, there was an

293
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,040
interest that was growing growing

294
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:38,079
growing so much and uh this interest

295
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:42,240
innate interest by by science and well

296
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:45,600
then I decided to start to study biology

297
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:50,480
without really knowing about what kind

298
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,720
of work a biologist uh does honestly.

299
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,120
But then during the the career during

300
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,160
the university I discovered that I I was

301
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,360
in the in the right place. So there

302
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,360
there was a combination of things.

303
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,240
>> Thank you for your answer. Um our next

304
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,720
question is can you tell us about like a

305
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,399
moment uh in your life when you ended up

306
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,519
realizing that you wanted to make

307
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:22,240
science useful um outside of the lab?

308
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,240
Yeah.

309
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,920
And okay. Yeah. Thank you, Marisa. And

310
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,920
again, it was not

311
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,839
usually it's not an anka moment. The one

312
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,399
moment that you say, "Oh, this this was

313
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:40,639
not it is a combination, but the moment

314
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:45,120
arrives." No. And you say, "Okay,

315
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:47,519
something need to change here." And uh

316
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,320
when I when I finished already my

317
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:55,839
career, I I was a graduated student, I

318
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,839
started to make research, no in a

319
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,680
laboratory, thinking in a uh the with a

320
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,240
scientific method and making a

321
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,240
hypothesis and experimentations and blah

322
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:11,120
blah and having uh hypothesis and

323
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,079
proving the theories all the history

324
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,680
about science and then publishing my

325
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:20,639
first paper and nobody reads my paper.

326
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,519
Absolutely not. So that was extremely

327
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:28,000
technical and it was of course address

328
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:31,199
to my piece. So I was trying to tell my

329
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,320
family to my wife and my mom and my dad

330
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,480
what my work was about and

331
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,199
I didn't know how to do that. and they

332
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,600
were bored because of my histories of of

333
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,519
experiments of failed experiments or

334
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,800
suddenly my paper. So the my work years

335
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,800
of work and nights of works and well

336
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,480
many things

337
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:00,880
were not uh reaching the people the

338
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,839
society and that was a norm. It is a

339
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,160
norm. Absolutely it is a norm in our

340
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,120
laboratories.

341
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,120
uh and then I realized that I was not

342
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,360
happy with that situation. Absolutely

343
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,360
not. And I couldn't wait for anyone to

344
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,120
solve that situation. So I started to

345
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,279
take training in science communication.

346
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,920
But in in that moment when I realized

347
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:27,279
that my research was not at reach in the

348
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,519
public, I said okay I realized that I

349
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,519
would like to make something for that to

350
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,519
happen.

351
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,800
>> Thank you. That definitely shows a lot

352
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,399
of your perseverance. Um, so our next

353
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,000
question is, what skills from your

354
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,759
research career helped you transition

355
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,759
into international work and science

356
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,759
diplomacy?

357
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:54,240
Yeah, again a combination of of of uh

358
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:57,839
skills. Absolutely. And

359
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,320
that transition was not from one moment

360
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,880
to another. It was not from one day to

361
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:08,160
the next day. This is a transition that

362
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:10,559
is built step by step slowly

363
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,199
and well I already told you guys that I

364
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,039
started during my PhD to take training

365
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,400
on science communication and that was

366
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:22,000
extremely helpful extremely helpful that

367
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,600
was the first thing I mean that was the

368
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,720
basis the foundation for my transition

369
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,799
science communication get trained in

370
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,440
science communication I mean taking

371
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,120
courses and certifications in science

372
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,520
communication.

373
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:43,760
That was life changes to

374
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:47,280
and and then I started to write a blog.

375
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,720
uh so trying to put in practice what I

376
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,600
was learning in science communication

377
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,200
and I open a blog I started to work on

378
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:58,720
my personal branding

379
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,520
and I cannot see at this moment my time

380
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:05,360
because that that part was

381
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,840
10 or 12 years ago and now I don't want

382
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:12,000
to read what I bought in that time I

383
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,640
don't want to see my my former website

384
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,120
uh because I don't like it anymore. Of

385
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,480
course, we all change and we evolve. But

386
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,840
that was extremely healthy. Extremely

387
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:27,919
healthy. So that put my name there in

388
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:31,679
the stage that started to position

389
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,919
myself as a

390
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:38,080
was not a leader because I was extremely

391
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:43,039
young but as as an emerging

392
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:47,679
leader let's say. No and and making to

393
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:50,000
start expanding my network you know so

394
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:54,240
it was that science communication then

395
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:58,240
personal branding absolutely and these

396
00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,600
pieces of decision or action then open

397
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,280
the door for other things no like uh I

398
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,960
was accepted for uh to take a training

399
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,080
on scientific advice and then a training

400
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,000
made on science diplomacy and what

401
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,000
difference is these two topic but the

402
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,280
basis was science communication and

403
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,360
personal branding.

404
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,919
>> Thank you so much. Um there's a question

405
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,440
from the audience. So yeah they ask

406
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,120
where do you think is the most

407
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,240
interesting environment for a young

408
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,240
scientist to grow right into?

409
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:41,760
>> Yeah. Wow. Okay. for young scientists.

410
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:45,520
Well, young scientists absolutely a

411
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,039
research laboratory is

412
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,320
mandatory.

413
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:53,280
Absolutely. No doubt. It is like that.

414
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,559
This is our way of life

415
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,679
with all the the imperfections of

416
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:02,840
academy etc. But is the way it is and it

417
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,840
is okay.

418
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:12,280
But it need to be complemented.

419
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,280
Absolute. So for building a

420
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,880
socially relevant career because I think

421
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,720
that this is key and this is important

422
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,919
to build a social relevant career.

423
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,640
It is important to devote and dedicate

424
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,760
time to civil organization. something

425
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,760
that connects you with the real problems

426
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,039
that are not the problem of from your

427
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,720
family or your neighborhood

428
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:45,679
are more complicated and complex

429
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:48,400
societal problems. So being voluntary

430
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,919
uh volunteering to civil society

431
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,360
organization providing your skills as a

432
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,640
scientist is extremely helpful. So and

433
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,200
that will enrich your

434
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,919
your training your yeah her development

435
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,559
as a early career researcher and to and

436
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,159
I'm including here in civil society

437
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,159
organization

438
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,159
um

439
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,720
like organized

440
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,640
students or

441
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,679
sciencemies

442
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:25,120
that they are also with a very good

443
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,039
connection with society and of or things

444
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,200
that are not related to science but

445
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:33,120
still uh science has a component there

446
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,240
environment

447
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:41,720
um something like that food the use of

448
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,720
the land there are many things yeah

449
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,960
>> all right wonderful thank you um so next

450
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,280
what does your work look like on a

451
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,880
day-to-day basis when helping countries

452
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,880
implement biosafety measures

453
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,840
Yeah. Yeah. my daytoday

454
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,440
uh basis.

455
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,919
I don't want to say that it's boring

456
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,600
because it is not. But honestly, the

457
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:12,640
most of my days I am in my desk uh in

458
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:16,799
front of my computer writing emails,

459
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,280
reading reports and writing reports.

460
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,919
But I enjoying it so much. It's not a

461
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:27,039
mechanical work. Absolutely not. I need

462
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:30,720
to put there huge amount of intellectual

463
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:34,320
uh effort because I need to be very well

464
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,520
educated on emerging biotechnologies in

465
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,640
the more complicated as molecular aspect

466
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,960
of the last uh genome editing

467
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,280
technologies because I I need to

468
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,000
communicate that to policy makers and

469
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,720
decision makers and I need to do it in a

470
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,039
language that they understand

471
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,840
but because of my

472
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,000
um my training and my formation as a

473
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,880
scientist I can understand both worlds

474
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,080
not the academic and I have learned to

475
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,559
understand the policy work so I am there

476
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,400
no as the bridge between these two world

477
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:16,559
this is 70

478
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:18,240
yeah 70 maybe 80% of my time the rest is

479
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,720
extremely exciting because it's

480
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,880
traveling I work in an inter

481
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,200
governmental organization and our

482
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:31,280
training because I am a trainer now too

483
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,600
uh and scientific advisor. I

484
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,960
need to go to the countries to

485
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:40,400
ministries governmental agencies to

486
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:44,000
other international forum to other UN

487
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:48,720
agencies and to provide our work. So I

488
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,200
am in my desk reading, writing,

489
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,200
implementing project from my desk and

490
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,200
traveling.

491
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,720
Thank you for answering that question.

492
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,039
Our next question is um in your opinion,

493
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,880
how can genetically modified organisms

494
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:10,280
or GMOs both help and even potentially

495
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,280
harm biodiversity?

496
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,080
>> Okay. Um

497
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,919
yeah

498
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,039
I mean it it is it is not my opinion

499
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:26,720
it's scientific evidence here scientific

500
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,960
evidence and GMOs can for instance help

501
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,360
reducing the need for pesticides and

502
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,840
this is something that has been

503
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,320
very well established and measured know

504
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:40,159
that the use of pesticide has been

505
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:43,200
dramatically reduced thanks to the GMOs.

506
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,279
you think that they are many of them are

507
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,799
resistant to pest. So it is not needed

508
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:51,799
to to apply the same amount of

509
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,799
pesticides.

510
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:58,159
For instance, now they are developing uh

511
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,400
crops that are more resilience to uh to

512
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,360
climate stress and this is something

513
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:07,440
that of course is going to provide

514
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,440
benefits uh to the biodiversity and

515
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,559
environment in general. These are just

516
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:16,159
two examples. Uh we need to think that

517
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:18,640
the GMOs are the genetically modified

518
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,919
organism. In the case of plants, they

519
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,880
are improved plants. This is made by

520
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:28,400
breeding. This is plant improvement.

521
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,279
So we are uh taking advantage of

522
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,640
genetics knowledge, genetic knowledge to

523
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:39,760
improve our crops.

524
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,840
Uh but of course as any technology any

525
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,880
human technology

526
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,200
there are associated risks.

527
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:51,360
There are risk in building a bridge.

528
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,720
There are risk risk to take a plane and

529
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,159
travel. There is there are risks to turn

530
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,559
on your when you turn on your kitchen.

531
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,520
There are risk there.

532
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:07,120
The thing is how to manage those risk.

533
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:10,559
No, how to uh how to cope with those

534
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,960
potential risk and biotechnology do

535
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,720
exactly the same. No, it is important to

536
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,120
maximize the benefits of GMO and at the

537
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,960
same times minimizing the potential

538
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,200
harm.

539
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,960
For instance, if a GMO is not well

540
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,480
managed, let's say, uh well, it it could

541
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:35,200
affect absolutely wild species, wild

542
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:38,480
plants or the soil microbes or perhaps

543
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,840
more more broad

544
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:45,440
ecosystem. It is not well managed. But

545
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:48,240
this is something that uh

546
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,000
is not happening. G GMOs is one of the

547
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,240
technologies or the product that is more

548
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,520
um regulated

549
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,520
and and yeah regulated in the world. So

550
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:03,360
so far there has been no any

551
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,720
important

552
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,200
harm to biodiversity at least in the

553
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,240
scientific literature. There are other

554
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,159
there are testimonies and any other

555
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,159
sources of information but in scientific

556
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,159
literatur.

557
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,159
>> Thank you. Uh we also have a question

558
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:27,120
from the audience. So could you describe

559
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,120
an example of a case in which you and

560
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,559
your team managed to make a difference

561
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,400
in a country's policy and in addition to

562
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,159
that what was the process like? What

563
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,120
were the challenges like? And what was

564
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,360
the time span?

565
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,760
Yeah.

566
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:48,400
Yeah. I I can highlight highlight one

567
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,720
particular example. It was due during

568
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,400
the COVID pandemic.

569
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,440
I was working in a project for

570
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:59,360
modernizing the uh bios safety

571
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:03,279
regulatory framework of the Republic of

572
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,840
Panama in Central America.

573
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:07,840
The thing is that the it exists an

574
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,679
international agreement and the

575
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,720
international agreements are legally

576
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,720
binding documents. So if a country sign

577
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,360
that international agreement that

578
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:21,039
country must

579
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,919
put in place laws and regulation for

580
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:27,760
that agreement to make to to

581
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:33,679
make it happen in that country. So in

582
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:39,520
the the in the beginning of the year

583
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:41,440
in when it was 1999 the 2000 2000

584
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,840
was 2002

585
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:49,200
the cart agenda protocol by safety was

586
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,880
signed and established by most of the

587
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,120
countries of the world. This is a

588
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,000
international agreement that established

589
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,000
rules for the transboundary movement of

590
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
GMOs.

591
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,320
Okay, that's fine. Now the countries

592
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,520
during those years most of the countries

593
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,760
they draft their biosafety laws and they

594
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,279
started to implement the cartagin

595
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:17,039
approach.

596
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:23,039
We are talking of the about 20 uh uh

597
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:26,320
2002 year 2002. So this is 23 years ago.

598
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,720
In that time

599
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,600
genome editing

600
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,679
uh didn't exist. It was not discovered.

601
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,600
Crisper and many technologies that are

602
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,760
now

603
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:42,559
uh in almost any molecular biology lab

604
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,679
in that moment no clues about that

605
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:49,440
technology, no clues about synthetic

606
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:52,640
biology and many other things.

607
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,120
So now the countries are working they

608
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,760
are regulating regulating their biotech

609
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,840
product with a agreement that was signed

610
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:05,760
predating those uh scientific discovery.

611
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,279
So they need to update their uh national

612
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,279
laws.

613
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:14,559
So that was the call from many

614
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:16,880
countries. Panama was um uh was able to

615
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:20,480
mobilize resources and to bring us in

616
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,480
place for helping them to modernize

617
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,440
their regulatory framework. It was a

618
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,159
fantastic experience working with uh

619
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,159
national and with officials

620
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:36,320
officers from Panama. The challenge,

621
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:39,440
yeah, it was for me was um unexpected

622
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,880
and is how difficult before different

623
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:46,799
national agencies to sit together and

624
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:51,360
draft uh a document. No, that is that it

625
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:54,080
will be good for their country.

626
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,919
What what does this mean? I mean uh

627
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,480
biosafety

628
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,760
uh biosafety committee no from a country

629
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,000
or of the biosafety competent authority

630
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,799
usually is made from different people

631
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,039
from many different minister no a group

632
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:13,520
from the minister of agriculture a group

633
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:17,279
from minister of um uh environment

634
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:20,640
ministry of of uh trade commerce

635
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:23,360
ministry of uh health so and they need

636
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,320
to sit together to establish this

637
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,960
regulation and that's difficult

638
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,919
difficult. They they all come through

639
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,480
with their mindset on agriculture or

640
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:36,559
health and that's the idea of course but

641
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,039
they need to you know the knowledge

642
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,320
needs to permeate between this silence

643
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,240
national silence and that was something

644
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,760
that was a learning experience for me

645
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,760
that this is not uh that easy.

646
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,279
>> Thank you so much. What's one example of

647
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:57,320
a successful biosafety project you

648
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,320
worked on that made a difference?

649
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,399
>> Uh

650
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,559
yeah, I mean because I work

651
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,279
building capacities or strengthening

652
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:12,279
capacities in biosafety.

653
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,279
Uh

654
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:19,679
for instance, we recently implemented a

655
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,080
project of regional workshops on on

656
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,960
biosafety no particularly in the

657
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,840
environmental risk assessment of uh

658
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,559
genetically modified organism. There

659
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,919
were five regional workshops in the

660
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,519
world covering all the continents and

661
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,799
each of the workshops in all the

662
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:42,240
continent were tailored to the problems

663
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,480
of that region. So we provide with the

664
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:49,600
theoretical part of course of the risk

665
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:53,919
analysis with uh risk assessment

666
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,760
and so on and then we want the the

667
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,679
attendees and they are a mixture of

668
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:03,279
regulator scientist farmers

669
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:07,120
etc. uh we want them to analyze

670
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:10,640
hypothetical cases for uh assessing

671
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,480
potential risks of a genetically

672
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,000
modified organism. For instance, we went

673
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:19,679
to Central Asia where where

674
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:23,039
is uh is produced is the main crop. So

675
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,760
we developed an hypothetical uh

676
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,240
genetically modified wheat adapted to

677
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,440
the environmental condition of central

678
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,919
Africa. In the workshop for Oceanania

679
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,360
and the Pacific Island, we developed a

680
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:41,600
case study of genetically modified

681
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:44,720
rodents, mice as an invasive species in

682
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,039
Ireland. And then for Africa, we

683
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,760
developed a genetically modified banana

684
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:53,200
hypothetical case.

685
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,519
uh recently in Brazil we developed a a

686
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,360
case study on genetically modified

687
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:03,279
mosquitoes for fighting deni and other

688
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:07,919
uh context relevant diseases.

689
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:11,359
So and this very uh large multi-year and

690
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,440
international global project was uh

691
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,240
extremely successful. I mean because we

692
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,480
we were able to train a diversity of

693
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,000
people and

694
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,560
um our hope is that they implement what

695
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,879
they have learned during our training in

696
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,720
their countries.

697
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,720
>> Maggie, apologies. I think you're muted.

698
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,079
All right, thank you. Um, so our next

699
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,320
question is, how could science help

700
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,359
bring countries together or solve global

701
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,359
problems like food security or climate

702
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,359
change?

703
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,879
>> Yeah,

704
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:56,079
thank you Maggie. You know,

705
00:34:52,879 --> 00:35:00,480
there has been precedents on how science

706
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:04,240
can improve international relations.

707
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,640
uh typically during the cold war

708
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,599
for instance there were

709
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,359
uh big scientific projects that helped

710
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:16,079
release a little bit the tensions

711
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:21,280
uh for the establishment I don't know of

712
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:24,000
uh research institute for

713
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,320
space exploration for instance was

714
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,560
another topic and there are several

715
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:35,920
examples of ho how

716
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:38,400
how they can help alleviate problems

717
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,720
uh because science provides a common

718
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,680
language not something that can be

719
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,280
understood and also a shared

720
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,520
evidencebased

721
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,760
approaches. Of course the political

722
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:55,520
tension are not solved absolutely not

723
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,400
but science helps uh to create spaces

724
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,040
for dialogue and cooperation and that's

725
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,040
amazing. For instance, here where I

726
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,760
live, I live in a little town that is

727
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,920
called Trieste in Italy. And we are in

728
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,880
the border with Slovenia in the

729
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,640
northeast of Italy. And this little

730
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,680
town, little city, Trieste is the city

731
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,320
in Europe with M with the bigger number

732
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,800
of researcher per habitat in the entire

733
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,040
Europe. And that's amazing. And that's

734
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,359
because here there are several

735
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,960
international scientific organization

736
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:33,680
like mine about biotech and genetic

737
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,960
engineering and there is another one on

738
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,359
physics and there is another couple of

739
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,640
international organization and UNESCO

740
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:46,640
offices and so on and that was because

741
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:50,160
this was the last city

742
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,880
uh before the communist block

743
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,280
uh now when Slovenia was part of

744
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,280
Yugoslavia and the communist country.

745
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,880
So, and here in Trieste was a point of

746
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,440
en

747
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,040
point of two encounter the first and the

748
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,280
second uh world the the capitalist and

749
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,599
communist blocks from the world were

750
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:14,240
here in Trieste. So when this city was

751
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:17,440
developed uh so much thanks to that

752
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,079
scientific bridge there. So these are

753
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,880
just examples. Now for the current

754
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,440
global problems like like food security

755
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,440
that is

756
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,680
sadly a never ending problem and now um

757
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,359
more concerning the climate change

758
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,400
problem

759
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,640
is more or less the same thing. We need

760
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,160
to think that we are in a common space

761
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,480
that is the planet earth and no a single

762
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,640
solution no a single country was would

763
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:52,160
be able to solve any of this problem and

764
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:55,839
there is need for a more

765
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:59,960
diplomacy and science diplomacy approach

766
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,960
for solving this problem.

767
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,440
>> Thank you for that uh answer. Our next

768
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,599
question is why in your opinion why is

769
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,880
it important to share science in

770
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,880
people's native language?

771
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:21,119
>> Yes. And this touch me

772
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,119
uh inside no that's because you are

773
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:28,640
noticing that English is not my mother

774
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:32,240
tongue and I have been one of the

775
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,400
affected no but because this strong

776
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,960
limitation

777
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:42,240
of the of the language

778
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,320
I must recognize however that it is

779
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,240
extremely beneficial to have a common

780
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:52,240
language for sciences. Absolutely. So I

781
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,640
very much support the use of one single

782
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,720
language for

783
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,520
uh

784
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,119
for having this global discussions and

785
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,320
you know trying to solve the global

786
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:07,440
problems no doubt and yeah in the past

787
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:10,640
was Latin,

788
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,599
Greek, French whatever language. Now

789
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,480
it's English and it is okay.

790
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:20,880
We need to consider however that most of

791
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:24,640
the population most of the population

792
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:28,000
doesn't speak English at all. So if we

793
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:32,160
want for the scientific evidence and the

794
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:37,200
global discussion to arrive to society,

795
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:41,680
we need to talk uh in their languages.

796
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:44,000
Absolutely. they need everyone should be

797
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,680
included in this solution especially

798
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,560
when they are the affected community

799
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,920
with the problems or the potential uh

800
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:58,079
deployment of technological solutions.

801
00:39:51,920 --> 00:40:01,440
Uh so uh yeah uh they absolutely need to

802
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,640
be reached by

803
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,760
context relevant scientific information

804
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,760
including including no in their native

805
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,760
languages.

806
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,119
>> Thank you so much. What advice would you

807
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,359
give to students who are interested in

808
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,359
both science and making a global compact

809
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:20,359
impact?

810
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:28,320
Stay curious. Stay curious and stay

811
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,800
open. Stay open. And

812
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:34,560
yeah, these students that are interested

813
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:38,000
in both both making a global impact and

814
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,839
in science. Yeah. Stay curious, stay

815
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,320
open.

816
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,680
The foundation on science in the values

817
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:48,560
of science must be protagonist during

818
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,200
your entire lives guys. Absolutely. This

819
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:55,280
is something that the scientific method

820
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,440
should be the guiding light in all your

821
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,440
actions.

822
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,839
Um it is important to adapt.

823
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,839
This career science is extremely

824
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,880
changing. You need to adapt to any

825
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:14,319
challening or

826
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:18,160
nice situation. So adaptation is key.

827
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:20,960
And don't be afraid to step outside the

828
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:24,640
lab. There are

829
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:28,480
several options or there there is life

830
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:31,119
beyond a a a lab bench.

831
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,560
And this is built again with well

832
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,680
strengthening your soft skills beyond

833
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,880
science and yeah expanding your network

834
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:45,000
and being active and doing things that

835
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,000
are socially relevant.

836
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,280
All right. Thank you. Um, so not too

837
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,079
long ago,

838
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,200
um, you and your colleagues published a

839
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,920
paper titled Navigating Biosafety, uh,

840
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,720
regulatory frameworks for genetic

841
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:08,800
engineering in Africa, a focus on genome

842
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:11,680
editing and gene um, drive technologies.

843
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,680
Could you tell us a bit about what you

844
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,200
and your colleagues found?

845
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,599
>> Yeah. Yeah, sure. Thank you. Thank you

846
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,480
for highlighting that paper. It wasn't

847
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,839
that by the

848
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,240
late 2024 we published this paper when

849
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:29,839
we analyzed no that the regulatory

850
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:33,200
frameworks in across Africa

851
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,880
and we looked at how different African

852
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,280
countries are approaching the regulation

853
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,280
of this emerging biotech and we found

854
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,040
that it is a lot there is a lot of

855
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,359
diversity that there are countries that

856
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,760
are ex

857
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:48,800
doing so well no countries that are well

858
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:54,160
advanced in the regulations there but

859
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:56,720
other are still with no regulations.

860
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,880
So there is a a huge difference there

861
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:03,440
and a very terogeneous regulatory

862
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,119
environment there.

863
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,000
But the good thing is that they all

864
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:11,359
recognize these gaps and these

865
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,760
challenges and they are all open to this

866
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:17,280
to perform or to strengthen regional

867
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,920
collaboration in making sure that all

868
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,280
the regulation are both both

869
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,119
science-based or science informed and at

870
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,960
the same time that are again locally

871
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:33,800
relevant for the problems and to be

872
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,800
relevant for for the context.

873
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,040
Thank you for telling us about your p uh

874
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,200
your paper. Uh our next question is why

875
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,560
might some people be unsure or maybe

876
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,119
even afraid of gene editing and how can

877
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:54,200
scientists and the governments help the

878
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,200
public feel much more informed and safe?

879
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,200
>> I mean yeah thank you thank you for your

880
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:05,200
question. Um it is completely normal to

881
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:07,119
be causian and to be a threat of new

882
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,160
technologies. This is something that is

883
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:13,119
in our nature. When the electricity was

884
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,640
invented there was there were there were

885
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:20,800
group of people opposing electricity.

886
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:24,319
There were anti- electricity groups

887
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,040
when the uh the train was invented.

888
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,480
There were anti-trained group of people

889
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,319
and protesting in the street because

890
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,319
they they didn't want trained in this in

891
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,040
their countries

892
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,520
and then yeah and so on with the horses

893
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,240
there were anti-horses group of people

894
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,720
with the car there were anti-car group

895
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,560
of people with any technology that is

896
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,960
deflecting that is completely different

897
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:52,400
that is no precedence in the history

898
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,800
there will be uh opposition

899
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,880
and biotech is not the exception.

900
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,960
This is another human invention and

901
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:04,800
technology.

902
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:06,880
Uh so with um genome editing um gen with

903
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,640
gene editing is has been exactly the

904
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:13,920
same with first with GMO 30 years ago

905
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,839
and still there is some. Yeah. So now

906
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,880
there is a there is still an important

907
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:21,200
opposition to GMOs and now with gene

908
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,640
editing

909
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,640
it seems that things are going to be

910
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,720
better for the technology for the

911
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,280
biotech.

912
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,040
uh but still some resistance out there

913
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:37,440
and I think that the key things here is

914
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,720
transparency

915
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:44,319
uh explaining how these tools these

916
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:47,760
tools work what kind of safeguards are

917
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:51,680
in place for avoiding

918
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:55,839
harm and what kind of risk and benefits

919
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:58,400
are and building this trust takes time

920
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:02,400
but it it start with listening not just

921
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,960
explaining this uh dialogue and what I I

922
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,520
am seeing now

923
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,240
is that hopefully we have learned from

924
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:15,680
the mistake from the past the mistake

925
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:18,480
that were done during the GMO era 30 20

926
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:21,440
years ago

927
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,440
for instance that that the the products

928
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,560
were more

929
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,000
designed for the benefit of farmers so

930
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,480
the consumer

931
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,400
were not feeling that this kind of

932
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,880
technology are uh a benefit for them and

933
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,480
this with genome editing is changing

934
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,119
now. For instance, there are developing

935
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:46,240
crops that are biofortified so we can

936
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:49,920
get more nutrients in our foods or or

937
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:51,920
the climate resident crops. There are

938
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,160
some benefit that we can see that

939
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,079
benefit for everyone not not just for

940
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:00,880
the farmers.

941
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:02,880
Um so yeah exactly so more an expanded

942
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,400
um

943
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,400
benefits and also transparency.

944
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,960
>> Thank you so much. How do you explain

945
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,640
complex science and ways that help

946
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,520
policy makers and everyday people

947
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,520
understand what's at stake?

948
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,359
Yeah,

949
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:29,160
this is a tricky one and it's not that

950
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:29,160
easy and this is a learning process and

951
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,800
and it is an evolution how to explain

952
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:38,400
these complex issues to policy maker and

953
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:41,920
technical complex and technical

954
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,640
uh I'm still learning because again

955
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:48,720
policy makers are not a homogeneous

956
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:51,359
group. They are extremely diverse, very

957
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:56,040
heterogeneous, intergenerational,

958
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:56,040
etc. So, it's extremely challenging.

959
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:04,800
I try to use analogies,

960
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:07,599
histories, visuals whenever possible.

961
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,079
What I don't use is jargon, scientific

962
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:14,400
jargon. And I try to avoid it as much as

963
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:17,280
possible and I try to focus on on in the

964
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,800
so what. So we have a new technology. So

965
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:24,160
what? No. So this what does this mean

966
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:27,440
for food on the table? What does this

967
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,520
mean for this is disease control for

968
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,480
pest control?

969
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:37,839
So that that again that connection with

970
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:41,200
the social part social relevant of that

971
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:43,359
um technology

972
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,000
and but again this is something that

973
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:50,079
need to be adapted. There is no one

974
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,319
sizefits all uh specified for uh

975
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:55,920
explaining these complex technological

976
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:58,240
issues for policy maker.

977
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,400
>> Thank you. Um, how do you believe your

978
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:03,400
work has grown you as both a human and a

979
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,400
scientist?

980
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,839
>> Again, let me see if my work

981
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,240
>> could you repeat?

982
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,079
>> Definitely. How do you believe your work

983
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,440
has grown you as both a human and a

984
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,720
scientist?

985
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:26,559
>> Okay. Yeah.

986
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:32,079
Well, to Yeah. Being perfectly honest,

987
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:35,200
the do doing this kind of work is

988
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:39,119
I mean separating totally your

989
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:41,680
professional and personal life

990
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,240
is not possible. It is a mindset. Not

991
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:48,160
being scientist is a mindset.

992
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:50,400
Absolutely. I'm I'm I'm sure of that. Uh

993
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:55,200
this is something that is with you uh

994
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:58,880
for your entire life and it dictates so

995
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:03,040
it dictates so much your way of life

996
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:06,880
your decisions your way of I don't know

997
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:09,280
to raise your child the way you engage

998
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,839
with your

999
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:16,079
society your neighborhood your friends

1000
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:20,079
etc is something that is it becomes part

1001
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:25,119
of of of of your person.

1002
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:27,680
So uh from a personal life uh I would

1003
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:30,480
say that

1004
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:33,680
my work has improved my personal life. I

1005
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:36,240
have learned many skills that I try to

1006
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,119
implement in my personal life on

1007
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,839
diplomacy on management

1008
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,440
trying to cope with different group of

1009
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,280
people

1010
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,960
in intercultural

1011
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,720
discussions. This is something that it

1012
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:54,400
is beyond my my work. So what I h I have

1013
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:58,000
worked there then with my intercultural

1014
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:01,119
group of friend I try to uh take some

1015
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,960
bites and from what I learned there to

1016
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:06,400
my personal life in my professional

1017
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,960
lives lives uh again it is a learning

1018
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,200
experience this is learning by doing

1019
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:15,440
just managing projects and trying to

1020
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:19,760
implement international projects uh is

1021
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:23,440
something that always enrich your

1022
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:26,559
toolkit no for being a good

1023
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:30,079
worker let's say uh and something

1024
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:34,160
crucial always is your network is your

1025
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:35,760
network uh so attending conferences

1026
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,920
um

1027
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,599
is extremely important but also your

1028
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:44,960
online presence is ext is not trivial

1029
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:48,400
that's that's not bal absolutely not

1030
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:52,319
having a good online presence and Being

1031
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:55,839
professional in your online lives life

1032
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:58,480
is something that is can improve and

1033
00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:01,480
change your professional

1034
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,480
career.

1035
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,440
>> Thank you for your answer. Um I have

1036
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:11,200
another question. So, how do you make

1037
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:13,760
sure that like new science such as GMOs

1038
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:16,240
end up respecting what people in a

1039
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:20,520
specific country believe in or

1040
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,520
respecting what they care about?

1041
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,680
>> Respecting. Okay. Um,

1042
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,359
okay. In in this case, I mean, I I

1043
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,760
cannot answer in the place of the

1044
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:39,839
developers. I'm not a developer of GMO.

1045
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:43,680
Absolutely not. Uh so my again my work

1046
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:48,720
is try to help governments know to make

1047
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:50,480
a safe use of the or how how they they

1048
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:55,200
can ensure

1049
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:56,880
that the GM crops are safely uh used or

1050
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,480
something like that.

1051
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:02,720
Um so it is up to each of the government

1052
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,119
to decide

1053
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,520
uh if a biotech application is aligned

1054
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,720
or is not contradictory

1055
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:13,280
or it's not going to create tensions

1056
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:17,119
with their population. So there are

1057
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:20,559
socioeconomics aspects that from any

1058
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:23,119
technology again is not is not uh

1059
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:26,559
specific for biotech. There are soio

1060
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:30,800
economic um aspect and I'm including

1061
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:33,599
here yeah uh for inance ethics and well

1062
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:38,400
many other things that the governments

1063
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:41,599
need to consider our role as a scientist

1064
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:47,680
are sciencebased

1065
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:49,760
advice or evidence and uh yes we need to

1066
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:52,400
give

1067
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:56,079
uh responsibly

1068
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:59,280
advice on how to apply science but the

1069
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:01,200
part of social economics is not

1070
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,680
according

1071
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:06,319
uh international agreements

1072
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,800
are not part of the scientific risk

1073
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:11,359
assessment. So this is part of the

1074
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:14,559
decision makers

1075
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:17,440
need to consider other

1076
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:20,480
sources of information for instance the

1077
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:25,040
ethics religious people indigenous

1078
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:28,880
people minorities etc. So that's the

1079
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:32,400
role of a decision maker to to keep an

1080
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,720
eye on all these spectrum of sources of

1081
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,920
information to then take a decision.

1082
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:41,480
Science is just one little part of the

1083
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,480
source of information

1084
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:49,040
and all they are important. It's not

1085
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,690
that science is more important. No, no,

1086
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,920
no. They all are important.

1087
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:55,760
[Music]

1088
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,079
>> All right. Thank you very much. So

1089
00:54:55,760 --> 00:55:00,400
lastly, why do you think it's important

1090
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:04,280
to engage with communities where biotech

1091
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,280
work is being performed?

1092
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,240
Well, but basically because they they

1093
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,319
are the ones most affected. No, they are

1094
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:15,520
the they they will be the the the

1095
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:19,520
affected communities.

1096
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:24,960
For instance, I am recently very much

1097
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:27,119
uh not involved but I'm I'm working um

1098
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,680
I'm developing literary reviews on gene

1099
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:33,119
drive. Gene drive are is a technology

1100
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:36,160
that is looking for modifying and listen

1101
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,000
this is crazy modifying wide population

1102
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,520
of mosquitoes.

1103
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,480
This is something that has never been

1104
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,480
done. Absolutely not to modify a wide

1105
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,480
population genetically modify a wide

1106
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,200
population of mosquito. This is extreme.

1107
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:53,200
Absolutely. And they are looking for

1108
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:56,240
modifying this mosquito for um ending or

1109
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:59,599
help ending malaria. Malaria is a one of

1110
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:03,839
the more deadliest uh diseases in the

1111
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:06,160
world. So there is a a public health

1112
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,640
issue that is that genetic intervention

1113
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,599
is looking to solve. No, this is gene

1114
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,280
drive. So the release the potential

1115
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,040
release because this is not happening

1116
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,040
yet. The potential release of this

1117
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:20,480
genetically modified mosquitoes with

1118
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:23,119
gene drive are going to happen in rural

1119
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:26,160
parts of Africa for instance. that is

1120
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:28,400
the most affected part of the world with

1121
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,960
malaria

1122
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:35,920
and what we are doing what they are

1123
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:38,400
doing from 10 years ago they are already

1124
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:43,440
working with these communities with this

1125
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:48,799
local community from the to co-develop

1126
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:52,400
the inception of the experiments even so

1127
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:54,640
this is part of the uh of the new of

1128
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,480
they are trying not to repeat the

1129
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,520
mistake from the past. No, for instance,

1130
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,240
with GMO, they suddenly arrive, we have

1131
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:06,400
this GMO and it could save your life,

1132
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:10,880
blah blah, eat it or plant it. No, this

1133
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:13,599
was an extreme failed mistake, an epic

1134
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,559
fail. Absolutely. Now what they are

1135
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:18,559
doing, they are sit in the same table

1136
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:21,839
from the inception of the experiment

1137
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:24,559
with the local communities. Let's try to

1138
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:28,160
co-develop the experimentation.

1139
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:30,720
What are the needs? What are your uh

1140
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:33,760
conditions for a potential release of

1141
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:37,520
mosquitoes in 20 years? And they are

1142
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:39,200
engaging and working with them now with

1143
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,559
the community and I think that that's

1144
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:44,960
the way it is for that kind of extreme

1145
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:48,480
interventions.

1146
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,799
