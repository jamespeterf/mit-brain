hearing from all of y'all and hearing

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,360
your questions. Um, prior to Sloan, I

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,520
worked in IT consulting and did

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,520
accounting and finance. My background is

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,759
in accounting. Um, while at Sloan, I got

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,759
to focus on product management and also

51
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,239
entrepreneurship amongst other things.

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,479
Um, in post loan, um, I now I started my

53
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,480
own IT consulting business where I run

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,560
the company and I'm also an IT product

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,959
manager working on the workday product.

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,680
Pass on to Karen.

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,599
>> Hey guys, it's so so nice to be back

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,440
with fellow Sloanies. Um, I'm Karen. Uh,

59
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,680
before Sloan, I'm originally from

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:33,280
Boston. Uh, before Sloan, I was working

61
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,760
in like the tech uh, space. So, um, tech

62
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,440
and policy space, excuse me. Um, so I

63
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,280
was Harvard working at a think tank

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,519
before that, worked as a campaign

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,599
manager in New Hampshire. So definitely

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,000
maybe not your traditional MBA

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,959
candidate. Um, but definitely took a lot

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,680
of nuggets um, out of Sloan. Uh,

69
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,599
currently I'm a project manager at Meta

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,480
where I'm working on their content and

71
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,120
integrity operations team. So basically

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,280
what I do is making sure you all if you

73
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,920
use any meta apps so Facebook,

74
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,920
Instagram, threads um WhatsApp making

75
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,000
sure you don't see um certain types of

76
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,800
harmful content. So that's kind of what

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,120
my day today is about and I will pass it

78
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,920
to Acha.

79
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,319
>> Thank you Karen and um and good

80
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,319
afternoon and good good evening all. So

81
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:25,599
I'm a me I'm a recent Sloan graduate as

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,080
of um three months ago and it's good to

83
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,879
be back um with um Sloan and with people

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,239

85
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,959
Sloan, I was a I was a partner at a con

86
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,080

African space, specifically Nigeria.

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,319
And after Sloan, I've I've rejoined the

89
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,360
firm, but now have a more of um a

90
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,640
continentwide approach of moving the

91
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,840
energy se sector forward. And while at

92
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,680
Sloan, I focused on sustainability as

93
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,599
one of my um one of my um f focus areas.

94
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,640
And that's what I'm doing now going

95
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,519

101
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,280
kick us off, I want to start with

102
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,720
community. So,

103
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,919

104
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,040
community and also like kind of what

105
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,560
were your favorite parts of the

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,479
community and what did that look like

107
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,479
for you in whatever way that means to

108
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,479
you?

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,280
I'm happy.

110
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,479
>> No order. No order. Whoever just wants

111
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,040
to jump in.

112
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:41,600
>> Yeah, I'm happy to share. Um, so when I

113
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:44,560
was at Sloan, I was um, so my first year

114
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,960
I was part of the uh, Sloan Energy Club.

115
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,320
I was a VP of community there. Um, which

116
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,280
also engaged in bringing together some

117
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,199
of the not just MITwide community, but

118
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,600
even collaborating with some of our our

119
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,759
peers, uh, specifically at Harvard. um

120
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,360
in their energy group as well. So that

121
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,720
was a lot of fun. Um and I was also uh

122
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,520
one of the um chairs within or one of

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,240
the panel chairs essentially for the

124
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,840
Africa Innovate Conference. Um so was my

125
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,000
first year and the second year I became

126
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,039
the co-president for BBSA, the Black

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,880
Business Student Association, as well as

128
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,199
one of the co-chairs for the Africa

129
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,320
Innovate Conference. So those were my

130
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,440
two kind of uh you know big community

131
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,160
leadership engagements. Um but of course

132
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,759
we led um you know had a number of ways

133
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,520
where we were engaging not just through

134
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,160
the clubs but just more socially and

135
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,160
interactive um you know on campus and

136
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,000
and around Boston. So it was always

137
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,600
something going on and way to connect

138
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,080
with uh fellow Sloan.

139
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,080
>> Yeah. Um I'll hop in there. um my

140
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,639
experience um at Sloan in terms of

141
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,199
community and kind of what I did um to

142
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,919
start like the club level um similar to

143
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,440
Dante um I was in several clubs I was in

144
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,600
the product management club

145
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,800
entrepreneurship club and um several

146
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,560
other things so that was one way to

147
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,319
interact with people um a fun way to

148
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,319
interact with people also was ours

149
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,240
groups uh we had like giant WhatsApp

150
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,680
groups and we had like a black WhatsApp

151
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,680
group called the friendly black hotties

152
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,199
where we would constantly just be in

153
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,199
communication with each other and plan

154
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,960
like events with Harvard it in with

155
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,120
people um at Sloan including game

156
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,960
nights, um movie nights, like just we

157
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,120
did a roller rink night where we like

158
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,039
all went out and to the roller rink. Um

159
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,440
and then you know also on top of that

160
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,600
just getting to know people with trips.

161
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,160
NBA the NBA experience is known for

162
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,440
taking trips and stuff and um I was I

163
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
took a lot of trips in business school.

164
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,759
I think I visited like 20some countries

165
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,360
while I was in business school and that

166
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,199
was a cool way to get to know people as

167
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,639
well. Um like I did like a boys trip

168
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,960
with like a lot of the like some of the

169
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,479
black men at Sloan. we went to um went

170
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,120
to London and then the following year we

171
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,199
went to Lisbon and where there I got to

172
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,800
really get to know people and and know

173
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,319
people a little deeper. My second year

174
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,039
at Sloan just to kind of loop it all

175
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,199
back around. I'm the VP of um

176
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,720
communications I guess for BBSA as well.

177
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,319
So we focused on like the social media

178
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,680
strategy and we also helped out with

179
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,000
like the sweater sales and stuff like

180
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,360
that. So um there's a lot of fun ways to

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,720
interact with people. It wasn't just in

182
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,479
the classroom. you really got to know

183
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,080
people deeply outside of the classroom

184
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,759
and and even now like some of the people

185
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,759
I got to hang out with are still my

186
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,199
friends today. We even took a trip in to

187
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,960
Phoenix earlier this year uh to

188
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,240
celebrate, you know, being friends for I

189
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,919
guess now four years. It's kind of

190
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,240
crazy.

191
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,160
>> When I met you, the first thing you or I

192
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,250
remember you said you helped create the

193
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,319
Kente sweatshirts.

194
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,199
[Music]

195
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:39,599
>> Yeah. Yeah. I was just gonna say Ellen

196
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,759
was integral in um the Kente sweatshirts

197
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,440
and so if you guys have seen that that

198
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,919
was all Ellen. Um okay so in terms of

199
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,080
community for me um I would say like I

200
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,120
kind of based community off a lot of the

201
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,639
my personal values and so like equity

202
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,639
and inclusion was something that was

203
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,240
really important to me. So I got

204
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,960
involved with BB BBSA um early on in my

205
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,919
first year and then my second year um I

206
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,599
served as co-president. Um mentorship

207
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,319
was something that was really important

208
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:15,840
to me. So um I my second year I served

209
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,199
as um gosh what do you call it? um like

210
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,400
a student like mentor, core mentor. Um

211
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,199
so basically like leading um orientation

212
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,360
and having a cohort of uh first year

213
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,319
students my second year that I kind of

214
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,640
shephered through their first year. Um

215
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,800
and then also I just like love having

216
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,039
fun and doing fun things. I'm from the

217
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,320
Boston area like I said. So, my first

218
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:44,080
year I was a CBC, which is called like

219
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,320
um a community building chair for my uh

220
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,760
cohort, my ocean. And so, that was

221
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,680
really fun, like planning random events

222
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,440
um from like Valentine's Day events to

223
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,480
Halloween events and parties and

224
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,920
whatnot. So, um that was like also a way

225
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,720
to to really get to know um my community

226
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,440
within BBSA, but also um just like the

227
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,320
broader Sloan community. Um, and then

228
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,040
lastly, I think to Ellen's point, it's I

229
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,519
think I met friends as well and like

230
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,519
built my community primarily outside of

231
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,839
the classroom actually. So, it was

232
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,680
through like involvement in, you know,

233
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,760
CBC, um, BBSA, but then also just like

234
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,640
randomly meeting people in a cafeteria

235
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,040
or like a trip. And I feel like your

236
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,519
random hangouts that you have like after

237
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,320
class in someone's apartment. Um I feel

238
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,720
like those relationships uh really last

239
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,880
and stand the test of time. And so I

240
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,360
have Sloan that have become really good

241
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,279
friends that have visited me now in my

242
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,399
new city. I'm going to a Sloan wedding

243
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,160
this weekend. So, um, our community runs

244
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,080
really deep and I think that's something

245
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,160
that's really, um, maybe unique of Sloan

246
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,720
than my other business schools is like

247
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,880
we just really value each other and like

248
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,360
each other for the most part and really

249
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,519
have fun with one another.

250
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,080
>> Yeah, just to add in there, I think for

251
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,320
me it was more um, first of all, the

252
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,279
Sloan Fellows program goes by really

253
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,040
fast. A year is a really short time. So

254
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,040
I think getting involved with the with

255
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,399
the clubs was something that a lot of us

256
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,399
struggled with just because of of

257
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,240
timing. But I was involved with the

258
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,320
energy club, the African business club.

259
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,600
But I think for for me I focused on it

260
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,320
from um informal point of view. So every

261
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,440
week my roommate and I had um Sloan's

262
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,760
over for dinner. So we would cook and

263
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,240
and like have chance to break break

264
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,480
break bread with classmates just talk

265
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,160
talk about things that you ordinarily

266
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,800
wouldn't talk about in class and also

267
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,399
just have a chance to reflect and get to

268
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,760
know each other. So I think for from

269
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,399
that perspective it gave me people that

270
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,640
I'm still f friends with now. I'm in

271
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,279
Dallas for for the weekend and in a few

272
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,920
hours I'll be meeting up with two two

273
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,079
other other Sloanies as a way to keep

274
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,079
that community going. So, it's it's a

275
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,079
very important value at Sloan.

276
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,440
>> I love that. I love all that. Um,

277
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,519
something you touched on, Karen. Yeah,

278
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,519
the Sloan cafeteria is notorious for

279
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:18,399
just meeting people all the time.

280
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,440
Um, and I love that. Okay, so this next

281
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,640
question is, what surprised you when you

282
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,120
got to Sloan? Um,

283
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,160
good, bad, all of it. What surprised

284
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,640
you? Um, yeah, in general or about the

285
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,640
culture at Sloan.

286
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,160
>> All right, I'll go first. Um, so I'll

287
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,000
start with the good and I think this

288
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,560
will answer a question someone had about

289
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,640
the stigma of not being team oriented

290
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,640
school which I have never heard and I'm

291
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,399
on like the subreddit all the time. But

292
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,800
anyway, like I think from my experience

293
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,399
for like the NBA subredder like I think

294
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,680
it was actually the helpfulness from

295
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,680
other people and the willingness for

296
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,519
people to help you not just when it came

297
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,680
to like in the classroom stuff like for

298
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,079
example your first semester you have to

299
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,000
take um a class called DMD and if you

300
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,360
don't know how to code anything it's

301
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,880
really difficult and I'm a person with

302
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,560
an accounting background and that never

303
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,320
touched that stuff but there was like

304
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,600
one of my good friends now Tyler he was

305
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,519
willing to just drop everything and

306
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,000
teach me and not only teach me but teach

307
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,839
other people how to do um how to code in

308
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,279
Python. on how to how to understand kind

309
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,200
of the work you were doing. And I think

310
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,880
that kind of spread um you know that was

311
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,120
kind of pervasive. I ultimately ended up

312
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,720
having allow or being able to help other

313
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,240
people with the accounting work. We had

314
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,320
to take accounting as a core class and I

315
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,800
was actually able to grab a classroom

316
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,480
and answer um the questions that people

317
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,160
had and teach them the basics and

318
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,760
foundations of accounting. On top of

319
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,079
that, you have your core teams and stuff

320
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,920
like that. Um, so I think the good was

321
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,839
really the Sloan helping Selonies wasn't

322
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,639
just like some corny mantra that's put

323
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,000
on, you know, things just to sell to to

324
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,600
sell a message. I think it was something

325
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,079
that was actually true and something

326
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,279
real. Um, I think one of the things that

327
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,880
was maybe difficult uh was the you're

328
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,720
going to you have this like kind of

329
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,560
choice paralysis, right? Like because

330
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,000
there's so many things going on at Salon

331
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,519
because you're some people are in the

332
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,200
NBA and they come in and know exactly

333
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,959
what they want to do. other people like

334
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,800
myself had a vision of what I wanted to

335
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,639
do, but after like learning more, I kind

336
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,639
of wanted to switch. And you do run into

337
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,839
this this um kind of scenario where

338
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,680
you're like trying to figure out the

339
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,200
best thing to do and and you ultimately

340
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,600
might end up trying several different

341
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,440
things. And even though the NBA

342
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,040
full-time program is only two years,

343
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,959
it's only two years. So like if you

344
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,480
don't focus on something like sooner

345
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,000
than later, then it might come back to

346
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,240
bite you in terms of like applying for

347
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,839
internships or getting whatever role you

348
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,279
want full-time. So I think that's

349
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,399
probably one of the tougher things for

350
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,079
business school. I know that's something

351
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,440
that's probably pervasive amongst all

352
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,880
business schools, but I think that was

353
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,399
just something that those are a few

354
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,519
things that kind of highlighted my

355
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,519
experience and the good and the bad.

356
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:52,240
>> Yeah, maybe one thing I'll add um to

357
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,240
that was a surprise for me was just how

358
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,560
like socially active and like really

359
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,240
personable the community was. Um and

360
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,720
it's not to say that I was expecting it

361
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,120
to to not be that way. I just think it

362
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,560
was so much further kind of on the far

363
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,959
end of the spectrum of being very

364
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,199
sociable, very personable, and in a very

365
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,720
good way where like your classmates are

366
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,880
really trying to get to know you for who

367
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,120
you are. They're not trying to oneup you

368
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,600
or anything like that. It's really um

369
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,600
you know, really trying to to build that

370
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,320
community at a very deeper level, not

371
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,079
just at a surface level. Um, I think

372
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,240
that was something that I was like very

373
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,079
pleasantly surprised by and and it

374
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,959
really I think really made my experience

375
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,560
there just one I'll never forget. Um,

376
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,440
maybe just to just to just to keep it

377
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,639
balanced of something that um uh was a

378
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,440
surprise that um wasn't so positive I

379
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,040
would say is is that so I I was very

380
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,120
engaged in like the broader MIT

381
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,959
community. Um, so it wasn't just at

382
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,320
Sloan, but there's a lot of schools that

383
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,079
are very good at what they do and

384
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,959
sometimes things are can be a bit

385
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,519
fragmented. But with that said, if the

386
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,440
people who excel at really pushing the

387
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,800
boundaries and, you know, have a

388
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,160
mission, have a goal of what they're

389
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,399
trying to achieve, you'll find that

390
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,920
there's more than enough resources, not

391
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,519
just at Sloan, but even at other

392
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,600
departments, uh, across MIT that may not

393
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,079
be well advertised or well known, but

394
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,680
it's those resource resources are there.

395
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,320
it's just not always, you know, front

396
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,399
and center for you to to grasp. Um, so

397
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,920
that was maybe one thing that's, you

398
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,000
know, has its pros and cons, but it was

399
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,320
a certainly a surprise when I got there.

400
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
>> All right. So, I'll um I'll start with

401
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,600
the bad for me. I think that that is

402
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,240
just matter of um the disconnectivity

403
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,240
with Sloan with parts of Sloan and the

404
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,959
rest of MIT

405
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,839
>> because you you take classes like for

406
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:45,040
instance I took a class in the

407
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,399
engineering bu building and I just felt

408
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,279
that the synergy amongst the the among

409
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,399
the two schools wasn't quite fused and

410
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,800
the Sloan time doesn't exist in normal

411
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,720
MIT. you you're running around trying to

412
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,440
get there on trying to be um be be a

413
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:08,160
proper student. And then I al also also

414
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:10,720
think that MIT is so broad that um a lot

415
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,040
of us at Sloan stay at Sloan. We don't

416
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,120
get a chance to really explore the

417
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,680
proper MIT um MIT community. So I think

418
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,680
that's also one thing that we we we've

419
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,160
got to do a better job of. Right. I

420
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,360
think the good is I was super surprised

421
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,920
the first um the first semester of just

422
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,120
the quality of the pro professors we

423
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,240
had. We had really fantastic professors

424
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,360
who who understood and who taught things

425
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,320
that quite complex in very easy to

426
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,240
understand language and also were

427
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,040
willing to help, willing for you to

428
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,120
email, stop by, grab a coffee and all

429
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,160
that. So I think for me I was very very

430
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,079
s surprised at that and then the fact

431
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,120
that they're so they're so qualified and

432
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,079
so smart they still had time to um help

433
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,560
you in some difficult topics. So that'll

434
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,959
be it for me.

435
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,759
>> Um

436
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,120
>> honest

437
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,400
>> Oh go ahead.

438
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,000
>> I would say my favorite thing about

439
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,319
Sloan is alone time.

440
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,480
>> Yes. I wish meetings at Meta started as

441
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:19,760
slone time.

442
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:22,240
Um, so I would say that I think for me

443
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,480
I think the bad was well it wasn't a bad

444
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,720
thing. I think just for me personally I

445
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,679
found it really to be intellectually

446
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,440
rigorous and challenging. Um, I didn't

447
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,679
come from like a science background or

448
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,880
accounting or engineering or whatnot.

449
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:42,880
Like I am a liberal arts girly through

450
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,200
and through. And so classes like DMD and

451
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,720
and some of the other classes were a

452
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,960
little bit challenging for me like

453
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,960
accounting and whatnot. But I think what

454
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,200
I really appreciated about the community

455
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,760
was that all my classmates were always

456
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,640
willing to like pull up their sleeves

457
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,080
and like just help me. Um whether it was

458
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,240
like prepping for an exam or like um an

459
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,480
assignment. And usually um in your

460
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,919
cohort or what do we call wow I'm

461
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,799
forgetting all the Sloan terms

462
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,039
>> oceans.

463
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,640
>> In our oceans but then what are our

464
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,600
little clusters of seven

465
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,360
>> core teams.

466
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,679
>> Core teams. Thank you.

467
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,400
>> Um in our core teams like usually

468
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,039
someone brings some level of expertise

469
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,120
um in your kind of core class topics.

470
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,760
And so those individuals were always

471
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,960
super willing to like sit down and like

472
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,880
mentor you um through uh the classes

473
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,000
which I really support which I really

474
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,080
appreciated. So I think everyone is just

475
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,559
it is like a truly collaborative

476
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,799
community and everyone genuinely wants

477
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,880
everyone to succeed and I don't think

478
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,120
you can always say that about all types

479
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,000
of communities but I always felt that at

480
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,000
Sloan and it wasn't just from my

481
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,480
classmates but it was also like your

482
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,880
professors as well who were willing to

483
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,280
schedule time outside of office hours

484
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,360
who if they knew you were interested in

485
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,160
something would like send you like

486
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,520
resources or articles or whatnot. not um

487
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,600
and so I just like pre appreciated um

488
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,200
the community and supporting me when

489
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,799
sometimes I felt like I was drowning.

490
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,320
>> Mhm.

491
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,679
Thanks guys. Um and a few people or

492
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,480
there's a couple questions that came up

493
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,320
and I'll kind of just combine them. Um

494
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,760
first part is how do you balance there's

495
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,440
a big thing about balancing with all the

496
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,400
clubs and everything. How do you balance

497
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,280
that with academics? And also in

498
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,840
general, are is there anything that you

499
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,600
had to do differently from your prior

500
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:45,559
studies um to now or to when you were in

501
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,559
um your MIT studies?

502
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,480
>> I think I can kick it off. Um I think

503
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,080
you just have to learn how to

504
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,160
prioritize, prioritize, prioritize. like

505
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,679
um there will be a million things like

506
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,919
it feels like you're drinking from a

507
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,280
fire hose sometimes. There are just so

508
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,440
many um assignments

509
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,280
um fun activities you want to do. You

510
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,280
want to go on all the trips, but you

511
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,600
just like have to prioritize like what's

512
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,440
really important to you and like have a

513
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,280
north star. And sometimes that might

514
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,200
change. Like I think I went into

515
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,799
business school thinking I was going to

516
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,120
be in consulting and that just like

517
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,360
didn't happen. But like being able to

518
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,080
pivot and like move from that I think is

519
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,640
really important. Um and as you're

520
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,240
pivoting um you know bringing people

521
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,720
along with you whether it's like your

522
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,520
colleagues or like switching what clubs

523
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,440
um you're potentially interested in. Um

524
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,600
so yeah I think prioritization was

525
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,320
something that was like really important

526
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,480
for me. Um, and your first year, first

527
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,080
semester, you'll try and do it all and

528
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,159
then you'll kind of get burnt out and

529
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,960
then you'll learn how to prioritize

530
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,200
second semester. Um, so yeah, stop

531
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,640
there.

532
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,919
>> And yeah, the second part to the

533
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,039
question was like just in general, is

534
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,679
there anything that you have to do

535
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,640
differently in previous studies versus

536
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,400
this versus MIT studies? Um, but I think

537
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,280
you touched on that too, Karen, just to

538
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,840
clarify.

539
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,039
>> Yeah, I think for me like I a lot of it

540
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,200
was new to be quite honest. So I had to

541
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,480
build up but that's why I applied to

542
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,240
business school and that's why I wanted

543
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,760
to come to business school was to learn

544
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,200
a lot of new skills. Um so I think for

545
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,440
me it was just like learning how to

546
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,520
think differently maybe tweaking like my

547
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,600
policy brain to a more business focus

548
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,440
and strategy lens. But that was

549
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,360
something that I really appreciated and

550
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,000
was able to learn and adapt from

551
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,720
learning from my um classmates and

552
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,720
professors as well.

553
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,520
>> Yeah. I was going to say one big change

554
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,520
is the internship aspect, right? Like if

555
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,799
you're doing a full-time MBA, um you're

556
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,159
going to have basically that first

557
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,720
semester, you've got to work on

558
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,960
prioritizing like Karen said, social not

559
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,880
just socializing and in your coursework

560
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,559
and your grades and stuff, but also

561
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,400
getting that internship that you want to

562
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,559
get if you want to go work at like a

563
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,600
Microsoft or Meta, wherever, like they

564
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,960
usually should recruit, right?

565
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,880
Basically, recruiting starts right when

566
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,360
you start school. So, it's a lot of

567
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,840
balancing. Um it's a lot of balancing.

568
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,600
It's also working with six or six or

569
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,360
seven new people you've never met before

570
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,039
who are from other parts of the world

571
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,559
who may have different working styles

572
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,559
and you've got to quickly learn how to

573
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,880
work with one another in your core team.

574
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,200
Um and then and and you really do get

575
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,559
this um experience of FOMO where you're

576
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,080
like, "Okay, I want to do all this stuff

577
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:29,919
plus I want to go on all these trips."

578
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,440
So, I would say like prioritizing and

579
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,240
making sure you get all those things

580
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,200
kind of um squared away right away and

581
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,240
and make sure that you focus on the

582
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,760
things that you're here to do at

583
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,080
business school, right? So if that means

584
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,080
you're there to pivot and get a new job

585
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,840
somewhere else then I would say focus on

586
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,280
getting your internship right when you

587
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,880
right from the jump from business school

588
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,480
and and you know there are other people

589
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,000
who are also everybody's also going

590
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,159
through the same thing for the most part

591
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,080
right so like um there's an

592
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,919
understanding that everyone has where

593
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,919
they know hey I'm going to go I'm going

594
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,919
to be recruiting for Nvidia right now so

595
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,280
I might be you know slacking on my

596
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,720
accounting work so can y'all pick up the

597
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,360
slack and then you know so forth and so

598
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,640
on it's a balancing act I forgot the

599
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,720
other part of the question but that's

600
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,720
like the difference in my studies

601
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,280
between what I did undergrad which is

602
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,039
accounting in in masters and undergrad

603
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,320
um in accounting and what I did in

604
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,440
business school but what was the other

605
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,360
part sorry

606
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,799
>> no I think that answers it was like one

607
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,400
part one question was about how do you

608
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,799
balance everything and one part is like

609
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,720
how was basically like your previous

610
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,240
studies different than this and it I

611
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,080
honestly a huge part of that is balance

612
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,840
so it's kind of just like

613
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,520
>> that was that helps thanks

614
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,440
>> can I say one last thing be don't be

615
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,880
afraid to say no to things like because

616
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,720
you want to do everything. Like you're

617
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,159
going to want to try to do everything.

618
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,080
Say no to some things. You won't miss

619
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,120
out on everything. I promise. Like it's

620
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,559
two-year program if you're doing

621
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,919
full-time. It's a one-year program if

622
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,240
you're doing like any other program,

623
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,200
right? Like or LJGO is like even longer.

624
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,799
Like you'll have time to do everything

625
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,320
or you'll you'll have time to do the

626
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,760
things that you really want to do if you

627
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,120
really focus on that. But don't try to

628
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,440
do it.

629
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,360
>> Yeah. I did want to add um maybe just

630
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,919
from like an LJGO perspective as well.

631
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,480
So LJGO's start the summer before the

632
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,320
Sloonies come on. So we kind of get a

633
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,799
little bit of a head start in in a sense

634
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,559
of you know adjusting to being back in

635
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,200
graduate school and that whole summer is

636
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,279
more kind of engineering and um like

637
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,360
math and statistics focused. So it's

638
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,520
typically more kind of academically

639
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,200
rigorous. So we kind of come into the

640
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:29,039
fall and already kind of in that frame

641
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,840
of mind. Additionally, one of the the so

642
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:34,480
LG's do typically take one extra class

643
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,840
and over what the MBAs take an extra

644
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,240
class, usually an engineering course

645
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,320
that um you know is with you know your

646
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,120
traditional engineering students, right?

647
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,360
Um so you do have a little bit of an

648
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,919
extra course load. On the flip side of

649
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,159
that, in the fall, um we're not

650
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,559
typically recruiting for an internship

651
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,600
because our internships are done through

652
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,880
the program itself. Um, if anybody wants

653
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,159
to talk more about how that all works,

654
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,520
I'm happy to have like separate

655
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,440
conversations. So, feel free to reach

656
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,520
out. But essentially, you know, we're

657
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,120
not recruiting for the the typical MBA

658
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,279
internships. It's all done through the

659
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,080
LJGO program. So, it's much low much

660
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,640
lower pressure in the fall for LGOS's to

661
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,400
again continue to find that balance and

662
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,400
get involved in a number of other things

663
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,480
because you're not recruiting as heavily

664
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,720
for those internships. But at the same

665
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,039
time there's like lots of like the

666
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,400
course coursework is pretty challenging

667
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,200
for LJGL particularly with the

668
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,360
engineering courses. Um but it's again

669
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,600
just finding the balance and being

670
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,840
intentional about your time um and how

671
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,520
you're spending it was one thing that I

672
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,880
had to learn through the that fall

673
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,799
semester um because I was definitely

674
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,360
trying to do everything and realized I'm

675
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,480
not Superman but it comes it comes

676
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,600
through trial and error. There's no

677
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,279
there's no kind of magic formula to it.

678
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,240
>> Yeah. And just to pick up piggy back on

679
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,320
that, Dante, I think um you can't do

680
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,799
everything, right? You it's just

681
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,559
practically impossible to. So, you have

682
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,640
to be very intentional and be very

683
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,679
strategic about what you can and can't

684
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,000
do. One of my mentors before business

685
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,080
school told me, "Figure out what you

686
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,799
want to do in business school. Write it

687
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,039
down and reflect on it almost on a

688
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,520
weekly basis to ensure you're chasing

689
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,080
your northstar because there's so many

690
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,919
options at Sloan. you show up and the

691
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:23,039
finance bros are talking about um

692
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,919
um ETAs um you got product management

693
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,159
people you've got consulting so the

694
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,000
there's so many options if you don't

695
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,039
have a northstar you'll end up with a

696
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,799
fancy degree from MIT great school right

697
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:38,480
but without a lot of um real substance

698
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,159
then you have to go back and relearn

699
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,400
some things and no one wants to do that

700
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,960
so really have a north star and stay

701
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,960
focused on Cool.

702
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,120
Thanks. Okay. And

703
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,840
now to move into kind of just like being

704
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,919
I guess a black person at MIT.

705
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,080
Um I guess one

706
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,880
one person asked if anyone has done

707
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,640
anything in terms of like

708
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,720
entrepreneurship and like kind of what

709
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,960
that's looked like if you ever faced and

710
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,960
maybe broaden it any face any situations

711
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,080
with less resources and maybe just in

712
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,080
general kind of like any reflections on

713
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,039
your time at being you know the black

714
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:22,679
experience um at Sloan and what that's

715
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,679
looked like for you.

716
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,320
So two parts, academic, how what that

717
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,679
looks like for you and just your own

718
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,279
personal experience in the Sloan

719
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,840
community.

720
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,880
>> Yeah, I can go first. I think for me uh

721
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,440
I walked into or orientation

722
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,840
and uh the Sloan fellow fellow's class

723
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,880
is about 103

724
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,960
people for my class. I walked in, sat

725
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,600
down, looked around, there were two

726
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,600
black people in the room. And in my

727
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,240
mind, I'm like, what is happening here?

728
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,000
like this is not not not not what what

729
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,720
it should be. Thankfully, a few people

730
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,880
showed up afterwards. It ended up being

731
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,799
six black people as opposed to two. So,

732
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,279
that's that's a huge improvement, but it

733
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:07,279
was still significantly less than the

734
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:10,159
rest of the of the class. Um, the good

735
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:13,039
thing about Sloan is

736
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,760
you'll have in my class, we had 44

737
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,000
countries represented. So there's so

738
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:22,320
many people from all over the world in

739
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,399
your class and it it the racial potent

740
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,279
potential racial stereotypes that the

741
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,200
typical Americans could have are not

742
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,279
there because you have people who

743
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,919
haven't lived those experiences and

744
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,480
you're able to meet people from day one

745
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,679
and really establish who you are and

746
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,640
being able to show up and um and and do

747
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:46,799
do the work and also be be caring is is

748
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:50,880
very important. important, but I but I

749
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:53,600
think um I didn't after the orientation

750
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,840
bit, I didn't feel that it was anything

751
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,399
negative being black at Stone. I felt I

752
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,320
felt pretty at home because all the

753
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,080
resources were were there in student

754
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,720
life and the admissions office, the

755
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,799
programs office. So, I think being black

756
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,880
wasn't a pro a problem. But I think when

757
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:14,159
I showed up, it was a bit of a of a

758
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:18,240
shock. But I once things started, it it

759
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:21,640
wasn't an an an issue that I I had to um

760
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,640
contend with.

761
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,960
>> Yeah, I'm happy to give some comments uh

762
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,880
about my experience. Um, so I've I mean

763
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,760
my whole life I was pretty much in a

764
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,840
very um diverse community um of multiple

765
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,840
you know how however any way you want to

766
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,399
think about that but it was always and

767
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,039
I'd say the black part of the like

768
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,360
population was never more than like 10%

769
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,039
of you know whatever environment I was

770
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,799
in. So, I it was kind of coming into

771
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,480
environment where I was already

772
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,720
comfortable and new, but the black

773
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,679
community is always, you know, very

774
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,080
close-knit and, you know, very

775
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,760
supportive of each other and always

776
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,600
finding ways to make sure we're

777
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,120
connecting with each other and

778
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,279
empowering each other and making sure

779
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,799
we're all moving forward in, you know,

780
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,039
the world that we live in, which, you

781
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,799
know, obviously doesn't look like us in

782
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,679
in our communities or in our, you know,

783
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:19,279
the black community. So, it was always a

784
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,240
positive experience for me and

785
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,000
especially at Sloan um with not just the

786
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,399
black community, but also being able to

787
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,240
share our experiences with our peers as

788
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,240
well and like what does it mean from our

789
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,360
perspectives to be, you know, black in

790
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,720
the business world, you know, the

791
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,240
challenges that we faced and really

792
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,799
having those open dialogues uh uh with

793
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,159
our peers. Um, so there's like plenty of

794
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,399
space to be able to have those

795
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,520
conversations which I found very

796
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,080
rewarding and very very uh empowering at

797
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,679
the same time. Um, and one of the things

798
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,159
that we did when I was uh on campus uh

799
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,640
we call them c functions u which is

800
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,399
basically an an opportunity for

801
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,480
different cultures to kind of share

802
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,799
their experiences through food, through

803
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,799
music, through dance through you know

804
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,120
whatever you know lens of culture you

805
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,799
want to look at it through. and we

806
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:14,399
started the um I think we call it the

807
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,720
black America C function. Um which was

808
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:20,000
like the either the first or second time

809
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,679
that it had been done at Sloan. Um and

810
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,679
it's actually shared across the whole

811
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,840
MIT community. So it's not just a Sloan

812
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,520
specific thing, but Sloan leads it, but

813
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,279
the rest of MIT is welcome to join. Um,

814
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,360
and so it was just great feeling

815
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,320
comfortable that we can kind of push

816
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,480
this out to to our peers and kind of

817
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,559
share what what our experiences are

818
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,720
like, what it's like to kind of have our

819
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,000
culture. Um, there's also an Africa C

820
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,279
function which I think had already been

821
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,279
established before as well. Um, so yeah,

822
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,240
just say all that to say that the

823
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,679
experience was never anything negative

824
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,760
uh from from what I experienced. It's

825
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,440
always kind of positive things as as I

826
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,159
reflect on my experience being black at

827
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,159
MIT.

828
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,120
Thanks, Dante.

829
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,640
I I'll know especially this year with

830
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,799
affirmative action and everything like

831
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,480
things have looked very different. In my

832
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,360
class specifically, I describe us as

833
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,200
small but mighty and I love everyone and

834
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,720
we had so many we went out to Martha's

835
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,159
Vineyard last year and we like we're

836
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,039
really close. And also to echo um your

837
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,640
point,

838
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:34,240
there's so many people over the world

839
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,399
like everyone feels a little bit new and

840
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,559
everyone has been extremely open to

841
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,760
getting to know one another and I don't

842
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,559
know if you guys feel the same, but like

843
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,360
that's been my experience.

844
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,519
Um and to your point, Jonathan, we've

845
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,880
had a few like ask me anything. We had

846
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,320
um um I guess a black at Sloan ask me

847
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,760
anything this past semester and a lot of

848
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,919
people came just to hear about what the

849
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,200
black experience was like and like just

850
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,960
things from our perspective and like

851
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,760
other affinity clubs have them as well.

852
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,720
So like things like that um are like

853
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,720
things that I really really

854
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:17,120
>> Okay, I think we heard you. Um, I 100%

855
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,279
agree um with your point, Arya. And I

856
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,799
think the thing I would add too is just

857
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:26,399
like I don't feel like being at Sloan I

858
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:29,279
was ever marginalized because of the

859
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,440
color of my skin, you know, like I don't

860
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:35,039
I think there was a question around like

861
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,200
resources or whatnot. Um, I personally

862
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,440
have never

863
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,880
um

864
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,440
personally that hasn't been my

865
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:47,440
experience. Um, I do think it's like

866
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,720
Sloan really tries hard to be like an

867
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,360
inclusive community. Um, and obviously

868
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,960
like everyone's their own individual

869
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,440
person. Everybody comes with their own

870
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,720
individual biases and whatnot, but I do

871
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,279
think like as a school community like

872
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,360
um, everyone really tries to show up um,

873
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:09,040
and support one another. Um, and so I

874
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,079
have found it to be like a really

875
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,480
inclusive community and I my friend

876
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,520
groups range from within the black

877
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,760
community to even outside of that. Um,

878
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,399
and so yeah, I I enjoyed being a black

879
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,960
person at Sloan, but um, I know that's

880
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:29,520
not everyone's experience, but for me, I

881
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,280
personally really enjoyed it.

882
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,040
>> Yeah. And and just to wrap it, I mean

883
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,040
like I would say the black experience

884
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,119
for us and like I already mentioned

885
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,280
obviously the affirmative action case

886
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,679
changed everything. Like our class had

887
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,200
31 black Sloonies. Um I know that

888
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,520
number's been cut significantly, right?

889
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,679
And and so I would say like the

890
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,720
experience that I had was wonderful in

891
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,720
the sense of you know not only did we as

892
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,879
a group you know get to know one another

893
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,399
at Sloan but then we also expanded that

894
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,480
right like the Harvard's right down the

895
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,160
road and like the black Harvard students

896
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,000
were like there too and we were we would

897
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,520
do like game nights and kickbacks with

898
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,359
them to like actually get to know one

899
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,680
another and we would you know hang on

900
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,280
campus. think when it came to, you know,

901
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,880
the black experience as loan, of course,

902
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,079
there were some like headscratching

903
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,079
moments where someone would ask a

904
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,320
question in class where you'd just be

905
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,079
like, "Okay." And you you'd have to kind

906
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,760
of correct them or like kind of call

907
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,680
that out, but it was never from a place

908
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,440
of like malice. It was just more like

909
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,800
they didn't know. And it's one of those

910
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,839
opportunities where like business school

911
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,440
is a place where you're supposed to get

912
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,240
to learn from other people, right? And

913
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,599
so in in a low stakes environment. And

914
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,119
so it was nice to be able to like have

915
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,359
that conversation with some people and

916
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,720
be like, "Okay, I I can see where you're

917
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,839
trying to go with this, but like

918
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,880
realistically that's not how like you

919
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,160
should you should see it from this

920
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,599
perspective as well, right? Like it

921
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,680
shouldn't just be from this lens that

922
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,119
you're seeing." And um to Cameron's

923
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,720
point, I don't think I ever felt like an

924
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,960
other like like there was never a point

925
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,359
where I was like I'm a black person at

926
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,800
Sloan and that was like like I never

927
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,560
felt that way. It was more just like I

928
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,640
am a I'm a person at Sloan who happens

929
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,320
to be black, right? I I really felt it

930
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,640
was an inclusive environment and a place

931
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,920
where you could not just you know feel

932
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,760
it from like the students but from the

933
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,920
faculty too like there would be cases

934
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,839
where like we would do case studies a

935
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,520
lot of how we learned at Sloan right and

936
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,920
there's there was some case studies

937
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,240
around race where we were like I think

938
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,920
it was u I can't remember the class the

939
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,200
the core semester class where we had to

940
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,240
like

941
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,160
>> OP thank you there's a OP case where

942
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,440
>> organizational processes sorry

943
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,560
>> yeah thank you there's a core case where

944
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,000
we're just like sitting there like,

945
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,520
"Okay, this is kind of nonsense." And

946
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,200
there'd be like chatter in the group

947
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,800
chat about all that stuff. And then we'd

948
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,240
also bring it up in class and like call

949
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,800
it out. So like I think there was

950
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,480
opportunities, you know, to expand your

951
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,680
horizons. A lot of the stuff like like I

952
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,280
said, I wanted to learn from other

953
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,040
cultures too. I got to learn more about

954
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,880
like a Saudi Arabian culture, Japanese

955
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,000
culture, amongst other things by, you

956
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,760
know, like getting to know our

957
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,280
classmates and stuff. So, I didn't ever

958
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,480
feel like I was like how I felt when I

959
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,760
worked in the business world sometimes

960
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,000
where it's like you're the only black

961
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,119
person and people realize you're the

962
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,800
only black person to treat you like

963
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,960
that. Like I didn't necessarily get that

964
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,720
feeling. So, I would say ultimately

965
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,640
overall it was positive. Of course,

966
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,599
there's some bumps in the road um on

967
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:13,760
certain aspects, but for the most part

968
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:16,560
it was working with me.

969
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,200
>> Yeah. And um let me know if let me know

970
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,599
if you can't hear me. But just to add on

971
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,960
to that, it is so nice having so many

972
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:27,680
schools in Boston because we have had

973
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,200
kind of just black students in Boston

974
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,960
meetups and that's been a lot of fun.

975
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,119
And I also feel like as Sloan and to um

976
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,440
Ellen's point, the corporate world can

977
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,359
sometimes be not be so pretty, but

978
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,680
everyone at Sloan, they approach things

979
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,040
with curiosity. And I think that's been

980
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,200
my favorite part of getting to meet a

981
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,720
subset of people who don't for the most

982
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,720
part aren't judging initially or are

983
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,760
truly just curious.

984
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,880
Um yeah.

985
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:00,880
And then Okay. And then next question.

986
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,200
Um to make it more fun, what's been what

987
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,200
is one of your favorite experiences at

988
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Sloan?

989
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,680
I'll give one that is very uniquely

990
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:21,520
LJGO. Um,

991
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,400
as part of the LJGO program, we do a um

992
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,920
like a global not global, but a uh a

993
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,200
domestic plant tre. Sorry, I had to

994
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,359
remember what it was called. It's been

995
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,960
been a while. Um, so we do a domestic

996
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,640
plant track where we go visit a number

997
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,000
of different partner companies over the

998
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,040
course of a two-eek span. Um that's in

999
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,280
the the first January of so basically

1000
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,960
halfway through the first semester or

1001
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,200
sorry through your first year. Um, so

1002
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,960
yeah, we're on planes and buses

1003
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,480
literally almost every day for the for

1004
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,480
two weeks visiting 12 or so different

1005
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,400
partner companies as part of our kind of

1006
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,000
immersion experience is getting to visit

1007
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,040
different plants, different operations,

1008
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,119
and also engaging with other LJGO alumni

1009
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,480
who are typically leaders at these

1010
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,160
facilities as well. Um, and so the

1011
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,480
opportunity to kind of travel around

1012
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,480
with kind of my LJGO peers during those

1013
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,040
two weeks, like we really got really

1014
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,280
close together, um, got to know each

1015
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,280
other very well. Um, to the to this

1016
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,280
point where I I still refer them as as

1017
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,359
family at this point because we've had

1018
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,599
so many very close experiences with each

1019
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,000
other. And then one of the the nights

1020
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,400
that we were there, I was actually one

1021
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,880
of uh two people that decided we should

1022
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,880
do essentially an LJGO ask me anything.

1023
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,480
Uh because we actually had for once a

1024
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,599
little bit of downtime in our evening

1025
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,200
and didn't have to go to like a

1026
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,359
networking event of sorts.

1027
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,240
And that ask me anything session, I

1028
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:49,359
think we held it like in the basement of

1029
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,560
the hotel we were staying in and lasted

1030
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:54,000
probably 3 hours long of us just kind of

1031
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,440
just talking about anything and

1032
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
everything under the sun. Um it was very

1033
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,480
just eye opening kind of revealing some

1034
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,839
of the the kind of deep experiences that

1035
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,520
some of us uh had um that you know

1036
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,440
others didn't really know about. So to

1037
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,040
me that's like an experience that I I

1038
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,280
I'll never forget is is kind of that

1039
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,720
twoe trek and especially that night in

1040
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,119
particular where we really got to open

1041
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,200
up and and share you know who we really

1042
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,119
are and what what makes us unique and

1043
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,520
how we think about the world and all

1044
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,520
that good stuff.

1045
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,359
>> Yeah. Can I cheat and give you two? They

1046
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,680
were they were back to back. So like I

1047
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,760
think one experience one experience that

1048
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,680
I really Okay. One experience I really

1049
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,440
valued was actually the Saudi Arabia

1050
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,880
trek. So this was like something that

1051
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,560
one of our classmates happened to be

1052
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,160
related to the crown prince. And so he

1053
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,880
hooked so he hooked us up with like a

1054
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,800
10-day trek where we got to go to Saudi.

1055
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,599
We got to actually go to Riad, go to

1056
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,760
Jedha, go to um Alula and then also

1057
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,520
visit Saudi Aramco. I think it was one

1058
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,119
of those things where like I had always

1059
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,960
read about Saudi Arabia and this isn't

1060
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,720
some plug for Saudi Arabia endorsement,

1061
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,760
but like it was more just like an an

1062
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,079
experience that I don't think I would

1063
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,319
have ever gotten to have um if not for

1064
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,680
Sloan. And then I think after that um

1065
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,440
and also getting to know our classmates

1066
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,880
like on a way deeper level while there

1067
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,119
like the people who were there and just

1068
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,480
like having like random conversations

1069
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,560
with people who I'd seen in the

1070
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,680
cafeteria but never really talked to got

1071
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,440
to know their story and got to

1072
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,440
understand kind of who they are and what

1073
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,880
kind of makes them. And I'd say another

1074
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,599
thing was um one of my favorite

1075
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,680
experiences at Sloan was Gab which is uh

1076
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,599
the global entrepreneurship lab and it's

1077
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,119
a class where you get to in the during

1078
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,359
the semester you get to work with a

1079
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,280
company that's international. My company

1080
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,280
was based actually out of Nigeria but

1081
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,960
they operated in Ghana and were planning

1082
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,880
on um um ext expanding to Togo and Benin

1083
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,800
and so we got to work with them directly

1084
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,079
on you know their strategy and their

1085
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,680
expansion strategy and then not only

1086
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,520
that but because Sloan is all about

1087
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,599
experiential learning we actually got to

1088
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,920
go to Ghana Togo and Benin and over like

1089
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,160
a month it was I think it was like three

1090
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,760
weeks we got to go and actually go on

1091
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,119
the ground in Togo and Benine and speak

1092
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,920
to people on the ground and understand

1093
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,440
their stories and help like help this

1094
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,680
company not only you know expand

1095
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,200
globally but also to understand like how

1096
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,400
their markets are different and I think

1097
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,880
it was one of those things where it's

1098
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,480
like I'll I'll never it's an experience

1099
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,000
I'll never you know leave my mind

1100
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,839
because not only was I working with four

1101
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
other people who I got to know really

1102
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,839
well but also you know getting to hear

1103
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,119
the stories of people from Togo and

1104
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,640
using Google translate because I don't

1105
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,640
speak French and Togo and Ben are

1106
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,000
French-speaking countries and like get

1107
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,359
but still hearing their stories and

1108
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,200
hearing the why behind the things that

1109
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,520
they do I think that was just an

1110
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,800
incredible experience and something that

1111
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,400
really value and something I take with

1112
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:38,720
me on a daily basis.

1113
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:42,480
>> Yeah. So, um mine mine are are two

1114
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,640
trips. I think as um Elon mentioned, MBA

1115
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,640
is all about go going on trips and going

1116
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:51,839
on track. So, I got a chance to take a

1117
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,240
trip with the with my classmates just to

1118
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:58,640
take them to the continent. So we went

1119
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,160
to na Nigeria and we also went to Ghana.

1120
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,280
And

1121
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,680
that trip for me was was kind of a

1122
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,880
lifecher for for me because it really

1123
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,680
gave me a chance to see Nigeria from my

1124
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,720
classmates eyes and Ghana as well. And

1125
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,280
that really opened up my eyes to some of

1126
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,960
the, you know, being from there, there's

1127
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,720
a lot of things you take for granted,

1128
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,119
but just having your classmates there

1129
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,839
and the fact that they can literally ask

1130
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,319
you anything was great because it now

1131
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:30,800
got got us to get to know know each

1132
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,839
other at a much much deeper level. I'm

1133
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,200
so very in touch with with all all of my

1134
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,040
classmates that we went on that track

1135
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,920
with. That that was a really good

1136
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,800
experience. And I think the other one

1137
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,599
would be at the end of Sloan, you you

1138
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:49,599
get to take a trip down to um the

1139
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:52,880
British Virgin Islands, the B BBI trip.

1140
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:55,920
That was an amazing ex experience

1141
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,839
because you're done with school and

1142
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,000
you're now about to face real life and

1143
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,520
properly graduate. But it's kind of a

1144
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
pause in that because you get a chance

1145
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,480
to really just relax and really enjoy

1146
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,200
yourself and and savor the moment of

1147
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,599
being done with school, but also knowing

1148
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:15,200
that you're connecting with people that

1149
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,480
you're going to be friends with for the

1150
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,800
rest of your life. So I think for me

1151
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,760
that experience was really good at at

1152
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,960
the end. Karen,

1153
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:27,520
>> yeah, I would say Gab as well was one of

1154
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,119
my favorite experiences. I lived in

1155
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,680
Kenya with um four amazing classmates

1156
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,280
that we are still like such good friends

1157
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,359
and I don't know when else I'll get to

1158
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,640
live in a country for a month and work

1159
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:42,800
on a really unique project. Um and then

1160
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,520
also I would just say like I know

1161
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,400
there's a lot of emphasis on trips but

1162
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,800
also just like the small like dinners

1163
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,040
that I would have in my apartment or

1164
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,800
like the kickbacks with the Harvard

1165
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,839
community. Like I just feel like the

1166
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,760
small things also were what was really

1167
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,520
fun. And I don't think there are like

1168
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,440
opportunities unless you're planning it

1169
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,520
out like 3 months in advance with

1170
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,760
friends now that you can just be like,

1171
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,800
"Hey, come over and like let's have

1172
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,599
dinner and like watch Love Island." Um I

1173
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,839
wish I had that now to be able to like

1174
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,119
chill with my Sloan friends and like

1175
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:22,079
just do the little things. Um and so

1176
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,800
like definitely like index on that as

1177
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:27,680
well. Um because I know the trips get

1178
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,680
really really expensive. Um but also do

1179
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,760
the trips because I miss that as well.

1180
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,760
But yeah, the little things matter as

1181
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,760
well.

1182
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:48,800
>> Can you guys hear me?

1183
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,960
>> It like cut out and now I can hear.

1184
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,400
>> Okay, really quick. We have about like 5

1185
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,200
minutes left and we have two more

1186
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,960
questions. First, um, whoever wants to

1187
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,440
respond, but how has Sloan impacted your

1188
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,440
leadership capabilities?

1189
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,960
>> I can go. I would say now um I like

1190
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,680
started at Meta a few months ago and I

1191
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,880
work with um really like high performing

1192
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:17,920
people and um I think something that

1193
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,400
Sloan really helped me to do is that

1194
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,480
like one being able to like communicate

1195
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,560
really well thinking about like the

1196
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,520
strategic picture of things and being

1197
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:30,400
able to break that down. Um I think also

1198
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,520
just like being confident um to like

1199
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,839
speak in a meeting. um you don't realize

1200
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,760
like sometimes um in like your strategy

1201
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:39,920
classes with Donsol when you're cold

1202
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,800
called you're like sweating in your seat

1203
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,040
but those are like moments that really I

1204
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,240
think prepare you for your professional

1205
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:50,319
career um so I think those are like

1206
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,960
skills that are like really important as

1207
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:55,119
a leader and then I also think um like

1208
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,520
most importantly is like being able to

1209
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,440
work with people and so I work with like

1210
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,280
a variety of different like crossf

1211
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,839
functional stakeholders and I think

1212
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,359
Sloan really set me up really well in

1213
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:08,720
working with a variety of different

1214
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:10,640
people from all cultures and usually um

1215
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:13,280
most classes, you know, you're given a

1216
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,119
problem to work on in in a small group.

1217
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,359
Um and I feel like that's a simulation

1218
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,520
to like what my real life is now on a

1219
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,359
day-to-day basis is I'm working on

1220
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,119
really complex problems with like

1221
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,280
variety of people from all over the

1222
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:27,920
world. Um, and so I feel like Sloan

1223
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,599
really set me up um to really think

1224
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,520
strategically about things. Even like

1225
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,520
the little things of like how do you

1226
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,839
like create documents and meeting notes

1227
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,000
and whatnot. I think like those are all

1228
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:40,480
like really important skills that you

1229
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,560
don't realize you're building um in the

1230
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:45,359
classroom but are really important for

1231
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:48,240
your future work.

1232
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:51,520
>> Thanks.

1233
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,520
Yeah, I'm I'm in my current role um

1234
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,839
which is like very much like operations

1235
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,319
like global operations strategy like I

1236
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:02,000
support um about 10 different

1237
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:03,200
manufacturing sites and some of my key

1238
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,480
stakeholders. There's like four

1239
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,000
different general managers, four

1240
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:10,240
different VPs of operations as well as

1241
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,560
kind of in my function I have my own

1242
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,800
management and their own priorities. So

1243
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:17,520
there's lots of different stakeholders,

1244
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:22,000
all of whom are much more well paid than

1245
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:23,680
I am and have a much are much more

1246
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,119
opinionated on what things should and

1247
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,440
shouldn't be done.

1248
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,960
>> Um, and oftentimes they don't see eye to

1249
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,640
eye on different things. So, it's

1250
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,640
organizational processes is one of the

1251
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,839
classes that I'm like leveraging all the

1252
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,480
time of

1253
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:38,480
>> how do I navigate through all of these

1254
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,880
big stakeholders, none of whom I have

1255
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,640
any responsibility over to try and get

1256
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,400
us all on the same page and

1257
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,480
understanding who cares about what and

1258
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,079
how can I get certain people to be on my

1259
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,640
team so they can influence somebody

1260
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:52,319
else. and all of those kind of chess

1261
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,640
chess games is is something that I

1262
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:56,960
really learned at Sloan um and I'm

1263
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,119
leveraging literally every day um in in

1264
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,880
my current role.

1265
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:07,599
>> For sure. OP continues to be brought up.

1266
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:10,160
>> Um with our last couple minutes,

1267
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:12,640
um if people if any of you guys could

1268
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,960
touch on any tips for black applicants

1269
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:18,280
right now, how they should approach this

1270
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,280
loan application.

1271
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,760
and highlight sorry and highlight their

1272
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,880
community, their involvement and and

1273
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,640
just like who they

1274
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,480
>> Yeah, I was going to say like first and

1275
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,200
foremost be authentically you like I

1276
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,559
think one thing that you know and maybe

1277
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,480
Terrell can speak to this better than I

1278
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,559
can because obviously I don't work for

1279
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,680
Sloan but like you know in my

1280
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,760
application I and in my video interview

1281
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,359
the the video you have to do like be

1282
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,880
yourself in the video like talk about

1283
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,640
the things that you care about and

1284
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,160
things that matter to you and don't be

1285
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,240
afraid to hide any of that, right? Like

1286
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,160
I know the current environments is what

1287
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:56,720
it is, but like I still think you, you

1288
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,119
know, Sloan is looking for people who

1289
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,800
are really, you know, are themselves,

1290
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,559
authentically themselves, and who have a

1291
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,640
mission to, you know, impact the world

1292
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,240
in a positive way. Um, I think another

1293
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,400
thing when it comes to the application

1294
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:11,040
process is don't only touch on, you

1295
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,200
know, what you want to do at Sloan, but

1296
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,559
like be get granular like talk about the

1297
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,319
specifics you want to do at Sloan,

1298
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,920
right? like do you want to if you want

1299
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,119
to become a product manager, what does

1300
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,640
that look like? Which classes do you

1301
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,920
want to take? Who do which professors do

1302
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,599
you want to hear from? What experiences

1303
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,760
do you want to have in order to make

1304
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,920
that happen? And marry how you are

1305
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,240
today? What Sloan will give you? And

1306
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,640
then and marry that to where you want to

1307
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,319
go in the in the future. So, like I

1308
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,000
said, be authentically you. If you're a

1309
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:37,599
black person, don't be afraid to be a

1310
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,200
black person in the application. You

1311
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,040
don't have to fit some box that, you

1312
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,520
know, checks every box that looks like

1313
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,800
some other applicant. just be yourself

1314
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,559
because ultimately I think that's what

1315
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,000
salon's looking for and they want you

1316
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,359
for you and I think that was something

1317
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,119
that I kind of struggled with in the

1318
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:54,160
application process but ultimately came

1319
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,520
to realize that you know as uh after I

1320
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,079
you know while I was there and after I

1321
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:02,240
graduated so that' be the advice I'd

1322
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:03,839
give blackies or black applicants.

1323
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:07,599
>> Yeah. And I think for me it would be

1324
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:10,240
around and ensuring that you tell your

1325
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,760
full story. A lot of people kind of hold

1326
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:16,079
things back because they don't want to

1327
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:19,119
put it out there. It's not your that

1328
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:22,720
makes your entire story makes who makes

1329
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:24,480
you who you are. So go out there, put

1330
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,640
things out there that could be

1331
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,000
uncomfortable, but but go ahead and

1332
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:33,280
explain how how everything kind of joins

1333
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,839
up. And I think finally, you have to

1334
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,839
kind of show why Sloan is important to

1335
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:40,640
you and how it's going to bridge a gap

1336
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:43,280
to where you're trying to get get to. So

1337
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,640
if you say, "Hey, I want I I work in

1338
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,640
finance and I want to get into

1339
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,240
consulting, that's great, but why do you

1340
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,800
want to get into consulting?" Paint that

1341
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:53,040
picture and ensure that it that the

1342
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,640
story ties together. A lot of the people

1343
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,640
that I've talked to who want to go to

1344
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,720
business school, they're not quite able

1345
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:01,440
to tie the story together. And my advice

1346
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,680
is wait and ensure the story ties

1347
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,599
together because even if they let you

1348
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,839
in, you don't know why you're there.

1349
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,480
You're just going to go there and you

1350
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:13,119
you'll be more frustrated than anything

1351
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:17,599
else. So ensure that you you you have

1352
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:19,760
that northstar and then also ensure that

1353
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,160
you know that you in your application

1354
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:26,079
you show why the Sloan degree is very

1355
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,079
important to get into your northstar.
