3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,440
the gardener lecture given by the

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,779
Department of aeronautics and

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,840
Astronautics at MIT

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,960
Lester Gardner was a friend of the

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,320
department was interested throughout his

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,359
career in aeronautical engineering and

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,399
was instrumental in founding in creating

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,980
the hunter Kerr professorship he was

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,540
mostly a publicist of the field of

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,969
aerospace engineering as it's now called

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,879
and was the published publisher for more

14
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,789
than 10 years of aviation and

15
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:51,199
aeronautical engineering and was quite a

16
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,980
noted contributor in his own right to

17
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,949
aeronautical engineering in the middle

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,629
of the century today for only the second

19
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,510
time in the history of the lecture we

20
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:03,390
have two lecturers who will jointly in

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:09,659
in a somewhat coordinated fashion give

22
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:11,640
the lecture this past week was the tenth

23
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,110
anniversary of the flight of the

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,390
Daedalus airplane human powered airplane

25
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,720
from Crete to Santorini perhaps

26
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,400
recreating the mythical flight of

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,820
Daedalus are going to talk about the

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,750
myth Jon you are I won't I won't take

29
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,220
any more of Jon's

30
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:35,490
ammunition and we thought it was an

31
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,829
appropriate time to to commemorate the

32
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,899
entire history of human powered flight

33
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:44,670
and asked two of the principals to come

34
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,740
and be with us today to share their

35
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,770
their view of this history from the

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:54,360
insider's view I can recall as I

37
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,759
literally as a young man that we had at

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,590
MIT a series of I believe it was three

39
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:05,119
symposia on low speed and motorless

40
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,500
flight in the late 60s and early 70s

41
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,510
largely organized by the late Jim Nash

42
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,010
Weber and brought together at that time

43
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,980
some of the leading figures

44
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,950
and builders of human powered airplanes

45
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,519
up to that point and my recollection of

46
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:29,040
them was the last of them was in about

47
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:31,379
1974 does anyone remember if that's 76

48
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,349
and that was still before any of the

49
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:37,019
Kramer prizes had actually been won if

50
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:40,920
my recollection serves me is that right

51
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:42,840
yeah so we decided to to make this in

52
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,900
some sense as a joint event that there

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:50,069
was today are organized by mark Drella

54
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,629
and Carolyn falkowski the technical

55
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:54,629
symposium on low speed and motorless

56
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,489
flight two to bring together the some of

57
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:58,349
the the ongoing technical efforts in

58
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,780
that area and then followed by the the

59
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,430
lecture this afternoon well let me

60
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,209
introduce very briefly our two lectures

61
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:11,849
there interestingly both founders and

62
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:15,269
and chairman or of various small to

63
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:18,599
medium-size flight vehicle companies I

64
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:21,810
guess you would say it Paul MacCready is

65
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,660
a figure who needs little introduction

66
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,069
in the world of modern aerospace

67
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,709
engineering he's the founder and

68
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:32,700
chairman of aero environment

69
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:35,130
incorporated a company that builds a

70
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,799
specialized aircraft with a particular

71
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,930
emphasis on advanced electric power

72
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,790
systems he's a member of the National

73
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:45,269
Academy and the American Academy of Arts

74
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:48,139
and Sciences and as you know and

75
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:53,299
probably and will hear more about is the

76
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:53,299
the father of the gossamer family of

77
00:03:53,510 --> 00:04:01,440
lightweight human-powered vehicles John

78
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:03,750
Langford is the founder president and

79
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,500
chairman of Aurora flight sciences a

80
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,780
company which specialises in flight

81
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,199
vehicles specialized to the

82
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:16,260
high-altitude environment and including

83
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,510
the Perseus proof-of-concept vehicle he

84
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,810
was the program manager for the Daedalus

85
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:24,030
project and the sparkplug for several of

86
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,190
the other previous human powered expert

87
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,740
of the airplanes at MIT

88
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:32,380
and in the interim between two of those

89
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,560
left MIT where he received his degrees

90
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,600
to go off and work on the F what became

91
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,850
the f-117 stealth fighter at Lockheed

92
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,910
Martin or at that time the Lockheed

93
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:45,280
corporation so without further time I

94
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,900
delay I'll introduce Paul MacCready who

95
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,900
as I understand it will speak first

96
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,410
thank you and good afternoon Friends of

97
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,930
airplanes human powered airplanes

98
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:09,370
challenges and fun this is a field

99
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,370
that's been going on for a long time

100
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,500
there's been a huge amount written about

101
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,410
it and in the short time we have this

102
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,640
afternoon there's no possible way of

103
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:25,150
going over this huge history so one is

104
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,660
referenced to a lot of books that exist

105
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,770
I've written up a version of my talk

106
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,940
version that doesn't have much in the

107
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,100
way of illustrations I'm going to show

108
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,270
lots of slides and videos here so it'll

109
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,700
be very different but the written

110
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,740
version does have a list of a lot of the

111
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:41,830
publications that you can read that

112
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,660
really give all the details on the facts

113
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:47,919
of what happened in this field of how

114
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:51,760
the field began and vents that have

115
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,669
taken place up till fairly recently also

116
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,590
I will show towards the end a video

117
00:05:54,669 --> 00:06:01,270
doing more with much less that shows

118
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,550
gossamer Condor gossamer albatross very

119
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:06,460
briefly which you'll be hearing a lot

120
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,740
about in the talk but also shows some of

121
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,870
the things to which those have led

122
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,820
fitting into a theme of the doing more

123
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,280
with much less and we give copies of

124
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,470
that video to anybody who wants them but

125
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,620
I only have a couple of loose ones here

126
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:22,000
but if any of you will sign your name

127
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,410
over there I'll put a card and one of

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,080
the little bolts on the far side of that

129
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:28,750
table

130
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,880
apparently mit has some way of magically

131
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,760
seeing to it that you will receive one

132
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,919
which because we'll just send them a

133
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:39,930
bunch so I wanted to not duplicate

134
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,759
what's in the

135
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,820
written literature but try and look a

136
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,740
little broader perspectives and the

137
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,500
broadest perspective the start way back

138
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,280
looking at what flight has meant to

139
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:57,750
creatures on earth several hundred

140
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:01,710
million years ago became obvious in

141
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:05,759
evolutionary survival challenges that

142
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:08,400
the air was a wonderful Avenue to get up

143
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,020
into away from the things that would eat

144
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,639
you and instead of having to crawl over

145
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,850
slimy things on the ground and falling

146
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:22,770
rocks and so on there is a nice pure air

147
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:26,699
to let you escape things travel long

148
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:30,690
distances look for prey etc and there's

149
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:33,330
such value in getting up into this added

150
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,099
dimension in spite of all the

151
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,190
difficulties associated with it where

152
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:40,830
you have to have wings and need like

153
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:44,490
wing loadings and you're fragile and you

154
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:46,470
have to have a good bit of energy and a

155
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,449
lot of specialization but the features

156
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,060
are such that I think something like

157
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:55,400
three-quarters of insects fly now and

158
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:59,639
then obviously other natural fliers

159
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:03,090
birds and bats and pterosaurs were great

160
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:07,849
success stories and some of them still

161
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:13,280
are to go through this very quickly I

162
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:17,760
want to start with the first slide which

163
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:22,979
shows the four arms

164
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:26,610
one human three belonging to other

165
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:28,849
vertebrate creatures and the three top

166
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,880
ones fly and because this ecological

167
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:35,729
niche of flight requires with things

168
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,039
that grow from little creatures and DNA

169
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,890
requires you something they're flapping

170
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:44,010
their arms and the slide shows that all

171
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,810
of them have including humans have the

172
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,130
same basic arm structure though they

173
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,720
started in the flight mode

174
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,550
a bit different times so they

175
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,680
accomplished it different ways but if

176
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,410
you follow all four of these back far

177
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,750
enough you come to certainly a common

178
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,780
ancestor for the top pterosaurs is very

179
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:07,010
simple and it's like almost like a big

180
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:09,380
hang glider and the that the outer half

181
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,630
of the wing spar is just the little

182
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,730
finger that extended way out and birds

183
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:17,480
do it differently bats use their fingers

184
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:22,970
as the control surfaces there's a lot of

185
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:25,370
different insects some old dragonflies I

186
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,770
think we're about two and a half foot

187
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,750
wingspan back in the old days and even

188
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:35,230
now they are wonderful successes

189
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:37,630
nature's helicopters birds are similar

190
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:40,760
hummingbirds are similar nature's

191
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,220
helicopters and they're the hummingbird

192
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,110
looks very similar to hawk moth which

193
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,330
occupies the same flight niche they look

194
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:54,740
the same but one's an insect one's a

195
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:57,530
bird the the Flyers that were really in

196
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,600
awe of are they some of the more

197
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,190
efficient birds here's an albatross just

198
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,260
magnificent for going out over long

199
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,230
distances over the ocean and you'll

200
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,990
notice a very high wingspan looks almost

201
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,850
like a sail plane and essentially no

202
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,130
tail that can whip out a tail for some

203
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,710
type maneuvers but most of the time it

204
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:19,250
does not use one same is true the

205
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:21,130
frigate bird which soars very very

206
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,530
gentle up currents and convection over

207
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:26,900
oceans because it's using these weak

208
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:30,350
thermals that are about a metre a second

209
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:32,750
it ends up as a superb low speed so are

210
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,330
sinking speed the albatross using

211
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:38,330
dynamic soaring is more like a sort of a

212
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,370
bullet with wings goes a lot faster each

213
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,260
one fitting their niche and then when

214
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,780
you get over land there are many other

215
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,120
kinds of soaring creatures and you start

216
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,160
seeing ones that are very good at the

217
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,880
low speed flight maneuverability all

218
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,650
those feathers doing interesting and we

219
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,150
are beginning to learn very efficient

220
00:10:54,650 --> 00:11:02,150
things in order to make flight work very

221
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:02,990
well and we just had a talk today on the

222
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,029
way wings

223
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,670
should join the body and turns out on

224
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:09,260
the that were resulted that resulted

225
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,670
from a lot of advanced theory and it

226
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,040
turns out they look just like the

227
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,459
vultures that have been around for 100

228
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,050
million years so we're learning that we

229
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:23,510
we now can see bugs birds and bats fly

230
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:25,040
but we can't see the pterodactyls fly

231
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,020
because they went extinct when the

232
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,700
dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years

233
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:34,459
ago as they started they the pterosaurs

234
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,560
they were REM fur encodes with tails

235
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:38,870
like you see here actually rather small

236
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,260
creatures more spiral like than the

237
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:45,500
awesome size that you see and then as

238
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:48,290
they got larger as time went on the

239
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,899
larger the larger ones began having no

240
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:54,170
tails it turned out an ounce of brains

241
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:56,029
used in active control seemed to be much

242
00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:00,110
better than adding an extra pound of

243
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:05,959
tail on the creature so modern ones just

244
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:10,100
flew like ordinary creatures and this is

245
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:13,360
the static display model of the largest

246
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:18,560
creature that ever flew the qn--

247
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:22,250
pterodactyl of which we made a flying

248
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,660
model that to be in a movie called on

249
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,980
the wing showing the evolution of

250
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,740
natural flight evolution of

251
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,360
technological flight and there were no

252
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,820
pterodactyls around to take pictures of

253
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,470
so we made a replica only an 18-foot one

254
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,329
rather than thirty six foot one because

255
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,040
we only were able to get up through the

256
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:39,740
temperamental overweight adolescents

257
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,940
eyes by the time the project was done

258
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,860
but it worked and in the flights it

259
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,870
crashed often but never when the IMAX

260
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,770
cameras were pointed at it somehow it

261
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:54,230
knew what its mission was but to have

262
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:57,020
this thing fly is just amazing that has

263
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,279
no tail trying to keep it pointing

264
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,850
forwards like trying to shoot an era

265
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:05,300
with feathered end forward and makes you

266
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,279
appreciate nature is so wonderful on

267
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,829
active control and those other birds

268
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,520
that I showed you aren't using the tail

269
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:15,829
there very often it uses active control

270
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,130
humans are edging toward that but most

271
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:20,100
of our planes

272
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:23,100
have regular tails I've got a video that

273
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,520
will show this flying if you start with

274
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,520
number one

275
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,390
[Music]

276
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:05,959
[Music]

277
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:50,820
[Music]

278
00:14:53,870 --> 00:15:00,529
Nature has a lot of different ways of

279
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:03,899
having flying things showing you the for

280
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:05,730
real Flyers but then seeds are made so

281
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,580
they have a pretty good aerodynamics

282
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,010
pollen is distributed through the air

283
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:14,100
spiders on spider webs can be

284
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:16,350
transported hundreds of miles and there

285
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,600
are many different kinds of flight and

286
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,770
there flying fish and many of you won't

287
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,140
believe it but they're actually flying

288
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:29,160
squid and they fly in groups and fly

289
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:34,610
very beautifully not very far all this

290
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:40,320
is to emphasize that all energy of

291
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:47,070
creatures on earth really comes from Sun

292
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:52,230
with a few exceptions and with different

293
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:54,930
time constants so solar power up here

294
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:57,570
you get instantly fossil fuel with

295
00:15:54,930 --> 00:16:01,680
stored energy of sunlight maybe for many

296
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:05,850
millions of years ago up here using wind

297
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:11,660
and heat to make thermals and airplanes

298
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:15,630
fly but also there's food for muscles

299
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:19,350
which is the energy that creatures use

300
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:22,320
to get around and so Hawk we'll start

301
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:25,740
with this energy and then we use a lot

302
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:30,690
that comes from wind and the heating of

303
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:32,579
the ground making thermals so I've kind

304
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,589
of shown a spectrum of flying things

305
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:39,500
that go from practically no weight up to

306
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:42,209
that giant pterosaur and the pterosaur

307
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,060
probably weighed their pterodactyl Keela

308
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:46,890
and probably weighed 180 pounds at about

309
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,620
a thirty six foot wingspan was the only

310
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,620
one of that species the large one found

311
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,020
and I doubt that one found the biggest

312
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,339
so and you look at some scaling laws and

313
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,070
there's no reason why they couldn't have

314
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:01,260
had one say forty foot inside feet in

315
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:05,760
size and there are some giant version

316
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:09,240
of that hawk or that vulture that I

317
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,579
showed that probably got up to 180

318
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,370
pounds and flew about six million years

319
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:18,000
ago these begin edging towards people

320
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:19,800
type weight and that that giant vulture

321
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,940
was probably around 20 foot wingspan

322
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:27,959
getting up towards span of that involves

323
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:30,870
real airplanes so there got to be at the

324
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,430
beginning of this century some interest

325
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,660
in human powered flight a lot more

326
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,160
interest at the very beginning because

327
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,250
people didn't know about engines

328
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,650
but once engines began interest in human

329
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,630
power flight sort of evaporated but an

330
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,930
early prize was to see how far you could

331
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:48,530
go just using the kinetic energy of your

332
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:51,980
momentum as you got a bicycle and

333
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:54,210
significant prize and it helped

334
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:57,990
competitions like this do help a field

335
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,850
move along there's another prize put up

336
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:03,120
in the middle of the 30s this is one of

337
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,560
the planes that attempted to do it and

338
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,660
they're really very great pioneering

339
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,460
airplanes person in there pedaling

340
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,200
couldn't quite climb but could greatly

341
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,560
extend the glide but I think had been

342
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,660
sort of sandbagged with the requirement

343
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:20,250
of the government leaving Italy that

344
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:22,020
this had to meet all the the strength

345
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,650
requirements of regular commercial

346
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,690
aircraft even though it would never fly

347
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:32,000
higher than ten feet and that rather

348
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:36,660
limited it was a great pioneering effort

349
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,390
and then a big moment in this field

350
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,860
there had been a man powered aircraft

351
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,420
group associated with Royal Aeronautical

352
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,850
Society for a while

353
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,920
Henry Kramer was a friend of some of

354
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,260
those people and after selling a

355
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:53,190
division of one of his companies he had

356
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:55,230
a party to celebrate and asked one of

357
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:57,870
these people how is that human powered

358
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,310
airplane stuff going and his friend

359
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,540
replied wasn't going anyplace they're

360
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,650
just sitting around talking to each

361
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,890
other it was going to take something

362
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:07,590
like a prize to make it go to get that

363
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,420
field going and Kramer who was starting

364
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:12,450
on his third martini said I'll put up a

365
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,570
prize and that was the deep insight that

366
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,280
went into what I think is one of the

367
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,650
you'll find from the consequence one of

368
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:23,930
the most creative action activities in

369
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:26,210
the 20th century and and does get you to

370
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:29,030
think about the importance of ethanol as

371
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:34,040
an energy producer or Liberator

372
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:36,770
anyhow Kramer is short fellow right

373
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,200
there and right after his prize came out

374
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,460
teams in England began focusing their

375
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,800
attention are really getting stuff out

376
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,350
I'm not sure which plane this is it

377
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:48,550
might be the puffins but they built

378
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:51,020
several large span quite sophisticated

379
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,160
though sophisticated one of the

380
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,080
definitions in dictionary is

381
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,990
unnecessarily complicated you wonder why

382
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,710
so many ribs and so on well it's easy to

383
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:03,380
be judgmental after long after the fact

384
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,700
this was a great pioneering activity at

385
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,320
the time illustrates some of the

386
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,360
difficulties but illustrates some of the

387
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,400
successes and they were able to actually

388
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,440
get the plane like this off into the air

389
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,170
under the high power that a pilot puts

390
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,970
out for and put out for a very short

391
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,710
period of time but it couldn't turn and

392
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,360
when it crashed would be six months or

393
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:24,280
so before they'd be back flying again

394
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:28,040
because of its complexity and there's

395
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,510
there Gant began ignore the albatross

396
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,510
that followed later but there began

397
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,950
being various planes that no need to go

398
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:36,200
into if you really want to get the

399
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:39,200
history there are a bunch of books that

400
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,030
give it in delightful fashion but bunch

401
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,620
of groups did work on this but the

402
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,530
surprising thing was after the first

403
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,330
flush of sort of success the first few

404
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:48,800
years it turned out people weren't

405
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:52,520
getting any closer to winning that prize

406
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:55,330
which was ingeniously the rules were me

407
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:58,160
asleep as a figure eight flight around

408
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,600
two pylons half a mile apart required

409
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,490
something to be able to turn left turn

410
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,780
right go up high enough the beginning

411
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,550
the end of the flight so it couldn't be

412
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,890
just some exaggerated ground effect

413
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,690
machine it took long enough so you

414
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,820
couldn't get by on that anaerobic power

415
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,620
where a pilot can put out one and a half

416
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,590
horsepower for a few seconds it had to

417
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:18,740
be the aerobic continuous power where

418
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:21,070
he's down to more like third or a half a

419
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,070
horsepower

420
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,860
I had no interest in the subject at all

421
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:32,020
but I had a background that was fairly

422
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,870
useful to prepare me for this insanity

423
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,790
about the the only interest I was like

424
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,920
everybody in the soaring activity I was

425
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:42,250
aware of the competition and I think in

426
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:45,550
the 1974 MIT event I was back here and

427
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:48,010
actually saw movies of one of those

428
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:50,410
planes fly think might have been Jupiter

429
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,840
and it was very dramatic and that

430
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:57,070
imprinted itself on my mind but I had no

431
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:59,920
interest in the the whole topic but I

432
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:02,200
did have a background in model airplane

433
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,020
building when I was a youngster and I

434
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,640
would make these indoor models somebody

435
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:10,030
else's I'm not a youngster here the

436
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,730
thing like this away about a gram for

437
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,290
the model for a 1 meter wingspan and the

438
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,330
rubberband that powers it another gram

439
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,460
and they've gotten up to one hour flight

440
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:20,950
indoors with these and propeller just

441
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,150
slowly goes like that and it kind of

442
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,700
moves through the air like a fish

443
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:26,860
gliding through a an aquarium it's kind

444
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,800
of a art form turns out to be amazingly

445
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,250
analogous structurally and and stability

446
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:35,170
and control wise to the gossamer

447
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,820
airplane is also familiar with hang

448
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:39,490
gliders because with my sons we were

449
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,720
playing with these as the sport was

450
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:46,120
getting pioneered in Southern California

451
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:49,740
in the first half of the 1975 1970s and

452
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:52,510
again came to appreciate the virtues of

453
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:57,010
tubes and compression exterior wire

454
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:59,740
bracing simple sail construction well

455
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,930
and I was also involved in streamlining

456
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,460
bike activities international human

457
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:06,820
powered vehicle Association began

458
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:09,940
getting going then go as fast as you can

459
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:12,910
with no rules rules stifled by

460
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:15,910
development for a long time now just go

461
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:17,620
as fast as you can and great

462
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,150
developments took place and through that

463
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,370
I was getting very familiar with

464
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:24,850
exercise physiology championship

465
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:31,750
bicyclists exercise training techniques

466
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:34,800
and so on and then on vacation trip my

467
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,630
mind got away with my mind daydreaming

468
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,190
it's very hard to find any daydreaming

469
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,290
time these days with so many pressures

470
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,870
but the only time I've ever gotten a Big

471
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:45,059
Ideas when I've been daydreaming mind

472
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:46,530
thinks for itself decides on what it

473
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:48,929
wants to think about and it was

474
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:52,230
connecting some some things in my mind

475
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:54,780
one of which was gotten a debt because

476
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,280
as a good guy guaranteed somebody's note

477
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,170
that a bank for a hundred thousand

478
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,850
dollar loan to start a company which

479
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:03,210
didn't succeed he couldn't pay it back I

480
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,620
was stuck with a note and didn't have

481
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,910
the cash to do anything about it but I

482
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,309
assure you that was stuck in my mind

483
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:10,710
someplace even on vacation trips your

484
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:13,230
unconscious would nibble away at that I

485
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,809
was aware that had no interest in the

486
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:18,470
Kramer prize which I had I did know it

487
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:22,230
was up to fifty thousand pounds but once

488
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:23,760
in middle vacation going I looked the

489
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,800
newspaper I found the pound was worth

490
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,679
two dollars at that time and suddenly

491
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,660
this light bulb just glowed over my head

492
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,420
why that's the same amount as my debt

493
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:36,809
how exciting an important human powered

494
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:39,750
flight is so I began concentrating on it

495
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,980
very hard and tried you know I'm

496
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:43,380
aerodynamicist I should be able to

497
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,940
figure things out but every design I

498
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,150
came up with were like those people in

499
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:50,070
England that were not able to that

500
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:53,220
didn't come close to succeeding with big

501
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:55,080
teams and big complex elegant airplanes

502
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,790
and invited my head against that wall

503
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,440
for a while gave up went off did other

504
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:00,870
things I was doing some studies a bird

505
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,820
flight timing how long it takes for bird

506
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:04,170
to go around in a circle look at the

507
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:06,270
bank angle you can tell it's flight

508
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,100
speed flight radius and then I began

509
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:10,590
comparing this bird with that bird

510
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,929
comparing dog doing scaling laws that

511
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,820
relate different size and weights and

512
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:17,880
speed compare that with a hang glider

513
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:21,210
and a sail plane and this hobby thing

514
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,890
suddenly as often happens I talk back

515
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:25,620
about human hard flight and realized hey

516
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:27,960
it's all solved there was an easy way to

517
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,880
do it which is if you make something

518
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,020
large enough and light enough if the

519
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,580
weight just doesn't go up and you can

520
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,960
keep making a thing like a hang glider

521
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,510
bigger and bigger and bigger no matter

522
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,840
how ugly it is if it's big enough yet

523
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:41,850
you can fly it on very low power and so

524
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,429
immediately made a model as soon as that

525
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,510
vacation trip was done you see here the

526
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:49,530
test didn't

527
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:51,000
you make a very large wing I had no

528
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,530
knowledge of wing structure but I had

529
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,720
knowledge of indoor models and so on

530
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,419
just used logic this is the best way to

531
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,870
make a lightweight structure and that's

532
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:02,130
the model and about two months later we

533
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,950
were flying the first version of the

534
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:07,290
gossamer Condor 55 pound weight with my

535
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:10,530
hundred and five pound son flying at the

536
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:12,780
time who would fly as slowly as six

537
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:14,640
miles an hour and had a lot of problems

538
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,919
with it in everything that exaggerated

539
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,590
the problem so that you could identify

540
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:22,770
him understand them but had one great

541
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:30,059
feature which is it was quick to repair

542
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:32,160
modify alter redesign and if if it

543
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:33,840
crashed on landing you didn't grab it

544
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,640
properly as it slid a little sideways

545
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,690
because stability control was just awful

546
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,429
and that too broke you'd get a broom

547
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,020
handle and some duct tape and take the

548
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:45,090
broom handle back on you'd be flying in

549
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,799
five minutes that accident would have

550
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,990
kept those people in England not flying

551
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,179
for something like six months so we got

552
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:54,150
huge amount of flight experience out of

553
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:58,080
this learning all the difficulties is

554
00:26:54,150 --> 00:27:00,780
just so thin fragile it seems as though

555
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,650
the shadow looks a little more solid

556
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:06,690
than the airplane does well we had we

557
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,460
began sensing the reason for some of

558
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:10,470
these problems was an apparent mass

559
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,020
effect that exists on all airplanes but

560
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:16,590
completely negligible the mass of air to

561
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:18,540
which you're coupled on the the plane a

562
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,910
regular plane is negligible compared to

563
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,980
the airplane here it was much much

564
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,660
larger than the mass of the airplane and

565
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:28,280
the person and it was affecting what was

566
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:31,140
going on Viking the controllability and

567
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,840
the total energy during acceleration

568
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:37,650
during turning why we couldn't turn we

569
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,270
use advanced computer models on

570
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:42,120
stability and control trying to get

571
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:44,820
answers about this and all the computer

572
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,620
models said is those flight observations

573
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,929
you made which is there's nothing you

574
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,390
could do to that wing in drag a L'Orange

575
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:53,820
dragged rotors would make any difference

576
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:56,010
just keep flying straight and maybe

577
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,240
sliding off on a side and that's what we

578
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:58,650
saw on that's what the computer said

579
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,600
yeah that's right

580
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:02,790
they didn't tell us what to do so I put

581
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,820
a couple of sticks together that had

582
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:07,620
gossamer Condor proportions shoved it

583
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,240
around in the swimming pool as you see

584
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,700
here here's one of the sons doing it

585
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,850
with your hand just feeling like the

586
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,410
force balance in a in a wind tunnel but

587
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,300
here you're working in the fluid almost

588
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:20,220
a thousand times denser than air so that

589
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,400
apparent mass effect is really

590
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,980
emphasized and within five minutes we

591
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,380
had the main answers what the

592
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,690
inarticulate computers hadn't been able

593
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:34,110
to tell us and we came up with the final

594
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:37,200
design a lot of the designing in detail

595
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:38,760
was done by friendly friends who had

596
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,650
lured into the project is very much a

597
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:44,940
team effort they were experienced at

598
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:46,740
build airplanes boats so on and this is

599
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,840
the way the drawings were done we never

600
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,460
had a set of plans until after the prize

601
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,670
was won the prize was not for drawing

602
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,110
plans it was for doing the flight and we

603
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,930
didn't have to worry about numbering

604
00:28:55,110 --> 00:29:00,090
plans and storing them so on yeah we use

605
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,650
computers on prop design and some

606
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:03,630
airfoil and stuff like that

607
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,800
when it was needed when this was okay

608
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,010
that's what we did

609
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,180
and wind took care of erasing stuff when

610
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,950
you were done it was appropriate

611
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:14,160
technology it's not the way to design

612
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,900
airliners but that's what we did and a

613
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,600
little bit on the construction aluminum

614
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,040
tube if the wall was too thick you idiot

615
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,700
chemically milled down to the correct

616
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:26,610
thickness and looking in the wind just a

617
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,680
lot of pieces of tape covered mylar now

618
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:33,390
we're making it a double surface plane

619
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:36,480
and got my youngest son or middle son

620
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:38,250
Tyler another person had been doing the

621
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,010
main test flying but that person had to

622
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:43,050
go off to Belgium so Tyler did a bunch

623
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,210
of the test flying next just working on

624
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:46,740
on a gamma to build himself up the

625
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,320
amount of power you have to put out is

626
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,800
about proportional to your weight and a

627
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:54,420
young person older person can do it and

628
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,900
he had some flight skills and he works

629
00:29:54,420 --> 00:30:00,450
cheap so we got him and with a new

630
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:04,280
version it was flying beautifully right

631
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:06,600
off the bat but still a lot of little

632
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,730
little problems with it and structural

633
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,370
and we needed to lighten its weight and

634
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,669
so on but it was kind of going in the

635
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:16,659
right way

636
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:18,720
we then decided we it was going okay now

637
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:23,500
we needed a real pilot Brian Allen and

638
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,059
here is with some of his exercise

639
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,820
training we were very lucky to locate

640
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:30,279
and he's a gifted pilot but also very

641
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:33,909
good on stamina willing fit into such a

642
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:36,789
project works on airplanes and we were

643
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:38,230
just so lucky but the biggest the most

644
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:41,200
important thing in this project was lots

645
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,360
of luck and getting him was a big part

646
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,679
of that now let's have the next video

647
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,080
rather than showing you a lot of

648
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:51,039
gossamer Condor things this video taken

649
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,200
from the kiosk of the national show some

650
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:57,460
of the part in led by dr. Paul MacCready

651
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,380
of Aero vironment incorporated the

652
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:02,340
development of the gossamer Condor a

653
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:06,960
year and was a friends and family affair

654
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:06,960
the earliest version demonstrated

655
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,450
featherweight slow flying aircraft

656
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:22,420
read the airspeed okay sock it to it

657
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:24,440
twisted let's get up about three feet

658
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:28,110
okay

659
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,920
[Music]

660
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,920
thirty-five

661
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:36,680
like battling left

662
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:54,570
the builders learned from both crashes

663
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:57,200
and computer programs and they made many

664
00:31:54,570 --> 00:32:00,989
changes to create the final airplane

665
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:06,629
with a 96 foot wingspan and weighing

666
00:32:00,989 --> 00:32:07,350
only 70 pounds six minutes and two turns

667
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:09,600
later

668
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:12,229
the only obstacle left is the 10 foot

669
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,229
finish Pole

670
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,630
[Applause]

671
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:27,280
on his prize-winning flight Brian Allen

672
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:29,980
landed with the words we did it a

673
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,440
tribute to the teamwork that made the

674
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:40,870
gossamer Condor fly into aviation

675
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:44,320
history this is a shot during that

676
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:46,600
flight the flight was great the pressure

677
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,990
was off the prize was one good bit of it

678
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:54,610
have been consumed in expenses on the

679
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:57,100
project and there's always a team I'm

680
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:58,990
sorry that the only way you'll get an

681
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,150
idea of the teams on all these projects

682
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:03,340
is to read the publications they were

683
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:07,330
not one person effort at all the team

684
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:10,660
was very important part ears Kramer at

685
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:13,530
the prize event in England a wonderful

686
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:17,110
forest Prince Charles gave the actual

687
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:20,679
trophy and cheque from Royal

688
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:22,540
Aeronautical Society and ended up in the

689
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:25,960
National Air and Space Museum where we

690
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:27,549
have recently last year cleaned it all

691
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,590
up and we didn't think it was going to

692
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:32,530
last there more than two years because

693
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,270
it was also baggy and floppy and taped

694
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:35,410
pulling and pulling out but now it's

695
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,330
kind of cleaned up and we put a

696
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:40,799
mannequin in looks just like Brian Allen

697
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:44,679
so people can see which way it goes and

698
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,450
the the kiosk video shows a lot of

699
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:48,490
people flying it after the prize flight

700
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,590
old ladies and little kids and so on to

701
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:53,559
make it make people realize this was

702
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:57,160
kind of a person next door project not

703
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:59,679
some big aerospace firm activity Kramer

704
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:01,870
came out with a new prize taking 18

705
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,190
years for somebody to go a mile he

706
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,020
thought it'd take another 18 years for

707
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:06,910
somebody go 23 miles across the English

708
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:09,129
Channel but we realized we just cloned

709
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:12,100
the gossamer Condor cut down the power

710
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:14,770
required 20% or so and selected the

711
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:17,200
right day pilot could fly much much

712
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:20,169
longer and do the job but now he was

713
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,159
carbon now no no new ideas in the

714
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:23,320
aerodynamics it wasn't all that

715
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:27,970
interesting a project but in the

716
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:29,700
structure carbon tubing instead of the

717
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,859
aluminum and

718
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:37,769
many more ribs much more accurately

719
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:41,250
contoured airfoil so on and flew

720
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:42,240
perfectly right off the bat but like our

721
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,319
previous ones

722
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,529
there were various there are some

723
00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:48,179
crashes and as we assess the situation

724
00:34:46,529 --> 00:34:50,309
it looked as though to get enough

725
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:52,079
testing on this get it over to England

726
00:34:50,309 --> 00:34:53,549
back was going to cost a bunch of money

727
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,159
we were able to get the DuPont company

728
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:58,140
to spring for sponsoring the project and

729
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,440
letting us keep the prize money as a

730
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:04,920
carrot out in front of us and so project

731
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:09,180
charged ahead you're doing some quick

732
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:12,660
flights as we began building cleaning up

733
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:14,339
the first plane we'd put my youngest son

734
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,599
because the only way 80 pounds in it and

735
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:17,900
you could just push it around and

736
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:23,400
nothing would get hurt if it hit hard

737
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:24,359
and then fix it up and Brian Allen was

738
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,089
doing a good job

739
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:29,599
flying but he was only able to fly about

740
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:31,950
20 minutes with this particular prop and

741
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,170
by going to a different problem that

742
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:37,859
gene Larrabee a design and people at MIT

743
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:39,599
here helped us with or actually did the

744
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:42,180
detail design than we did the building

745
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,700
this optimized the prop very elegantly

746
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:48,180
for the cruise condition on the flight

747
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:49,920
and with playing Brian did a flight of

748
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,569
about an hour and 20 minutes landed and

749
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,420
felt he could have gone on forever so we

750
00:35:51,569 --> 00:35:56,220
were off to England miraculously we

751
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,660
didn't know how to get to England but in

752
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,269
the middle of the night I get a phone

753
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,549
call very muffled have the alcohol those

754
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:06,329
airplanes at Nellis Air Force Base at

755
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:08,609
2:00 a.m. on Saturday and that was the

756
00:36:06,329 --> 00:36:11,160
message and so there is a c-130 from

757
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:12,420
Royal Aeronautical Society three human

758
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,490
powered airplanes were all crammed

759
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,160
inside and all our belongings and so on

760
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,769
it was just another well luck a good

761
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,470
luck is more important than anything

762
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:25,230
Brian Allen doing a lot of training in

763
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:27,869
England and training with Joe master

764
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:30,390
Paolo in hot humid conditions with no

765
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:32,279
air blowing on and in order to get

766
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:38,490
training for what it would be like in

767
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:40,349
the plane during the flight then on the

768
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,220
day when the weather looked as though it

769
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:45,280
just might be okay we're on the

770
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:48,490
worn near Dover getting ready for the

771
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,400
flight to begin let's have the next wait

772
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:54,970
a minute before the video begins the

773
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,700
takeoff because of that prop was great

774
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:59,110
for crews but it was rather poor for

775
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,540
takeoff when you're going very slowly

776
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:03,610
and we hadn't realized how bad we had

777
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:06,430
always done it on big airports before

778
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:08,170
here we put out a little runway of

779
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,700
pieces of plywood the wing running

780
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,610
wasn't done quite right and the plane

781
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:15,910
got just off the plywood and the little

782
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:19,420
toy two-ounce wheel fell into the only

783
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:21,700
little hole in that big acre of concrete

784
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,650
and snapped and so there's the plane

785
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:26,050
that was our start and this is an

786
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:27,700
audience participation exercise you're

787
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,580
asked to see if you can figure out who

788
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:35,440
is the the DuPont representative who is

789
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:37,570
running the project but about 10 minutes

790
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,730
later plane started on what the most

791
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:42,130
fantastic journey most fantastic

792
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:44,520
physical stamina event that I've ever

793
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,520
heard of

794
00:37:53,290 --> 00:38:02,110
[Music]

795
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:09,359
nam lee brian pedals on no longer

796
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,440
counting time his flight instruments no

797
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,300
longer function

798
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,300
his water supplies exhausted

799
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:19,410
when at last he cites the French coast

800
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,370
through the haze his heart sinks it is

801
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:28,719
still three miles away

802
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:28,719
[Music]

803
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:36,890
Brian each moment now has become a

804
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:40,130
victory dehydrated and suffering severe

805
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:43,460
leg cramps his judgment has begun to

806
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:46,210
waver briefly he considers crashing on

807
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,210
the rocky point

808
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,609
[Applause]

809
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,290
instead he fights to save the outlet

810
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:57,300
cross from the turbulence than the

811
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:00,050
clause added and nearly wrecks it a few

812
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,050
feet offshore

813
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:13,350
and slowly at last

814
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:35,520
okay and a bigger team but many of the

815
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:38,340
same members from the first team on this

816
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,140
project we never had so much pressure

817
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,790
and I've never been so exhausted and all

818
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:44,150
the people we were using psychic

819
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:46,290
kinetics for

820
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:49,170
telekinesis or whatever for lifting

821
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:55,860
Brian during that whole thing from boat

822
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:57,720
it was tough this shows at her apartment

823
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,360
we're into a lot of different things and

824
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:03,270
when these human powered airplanes began

825
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:06,720
to spawned a big list of projects that

826
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:08,850
are ongoing now and we're growing 240

827
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,430
people were going as fast as we can find

828
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:14,160
really qualified people and it relates

829
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:17,060
to ground things and energy things with

830
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,520
a lot of commonality between all these

831
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:23,580
there many too many things to describe

832
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,290
that the gossamer aircraft led to the

833
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,180
important point is that it led to just

834
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:29,070
so many things that I heartily recommend

835
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:32,030
everybody should get a hundred thousand

836
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:34,830
dollar debt to get themselves moving and

837
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:37,800
and also get some projects that don't

838
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:41,580
require a product the next year but let

839
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:44,750
you really explore the frontiers of some

840
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:49,050
technology here's the first solar flight

841
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:50,400
there 80 pounds Sun still because we

842
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,020
didn't have many solar cells and that

843
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,730
actually climbed a little bit just on

844
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:58,890
the power of solar cells this is Bionic

845
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:03,330
bat that won two of the Kramer Speed

846
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:05,850
prizes and here's a flying telephone

847
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:08,850
pole that's very hard to describe but

848
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:16,170
it's amazing what things will fly out of

849
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:21,210
El Mirage and let's well I'll go back on

850
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:23,760
this as a human power this is the last

851
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:25,260
of the human power slides there's a

852
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,260
human powered airplane that our sons

853
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,880
figured out how to do and this kid who

854
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,440
can walk a whole city block with his

855
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,480
hands in his pockets and just the up

856
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,430
current of the air going around his body

857
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:37,860
and over his forehead will keep that

858
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:39,220
airplane up there we have not found this

859
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,820
to be a

860
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:44,830
a marketable talent unfortunately and

861
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:50,950
he's just home goofing off right now

862
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:54,970
let's have the next videos it made some

863
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:57,160
big planes the but also some little

864
00:41:54,970 --> 00:42:00,100
planes here you see a little thing

865
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:04,120
weighs one point eight grams zooming

866
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:06,850
around the room and under radio control

867
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:12,660
it's got a video camera in it and all

868
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:15,310
the telemetry and so on and so do you

869
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:21,700
you'll catch it on this one which is the

870
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:23,950
preferred landing technique and then on

871
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:28,570
the next go-around who had flown these

872
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:31,630
inside auditoriums like this but and now

873
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:33,130
you'll see what the airplane saw it was

874
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:36,310
very crude camera we have better ones

875
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:39,190
now color and a little higher light

876
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:42,870
level and so on but you you are there

877
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:50,350
okay next video please

878
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:53,440
the next video I I won't have time today

879
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:55,180
to show you the Birdman contest showing

880
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,640
you things that we did Birdman contest

881
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,860
in Japan they have 70 human power or

882
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,930
glider aircraft fly that are just

883
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:03,400
wonderful it's a wonderful training aid

884
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,870
it seems silly they're all destroyed

885
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,030
they go out from a 10-meter platform

886
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:10,590
over the water and they all land in the

887
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:10,590
water and that's the end of

888
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,470
doing more as much less that you get a

889
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:23,590
free copy of

890
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:26,750
[Music]

891
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:29,540
is a vital feature of a world that works

892
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:31,420
where our increasing demands are met yet

893
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:34,250
to not overwhelm the limits of the earth

894
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,810
some of the unusual efficient vehicles

895
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:38,210
with which arrow vironment has been

896
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:40,790
involved serve as visual metaphors for

897
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:43,940
the theme most traumatic is the unmanned

898
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:45,830
100-foot solar-powered Pathfinder here

899
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:49,280
undergoing low altitude tests in late

900
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:51,710
1993 versions are aimed at eternal

901
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,950
flight or at least flights for months

902
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:57,170
above 65,000 feet to carry equipment for

903
00:43:54,950 --> 00:44:01,820
surveillance stratospheric monitoring

904
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:04,520
and telecommunications last summer 2007

905
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:08,000
T pound gossamer albatross was peddled

906
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:10,640
20 across the English Channel in 1979

907
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,830
doing the largest prize and aviation

908
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:18,530
history it demonstrates what can be done

909
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:20,510
with low power when new concepts of

910
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,910
efficiency are unleashed by challenges

911
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:25,010
not burdened by constraints from narrow

912
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:27,410
rules or the need for commercial

913
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:29,750
production it is a catalyst for new

914
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:31,910
perspectives that can lead to useful

915
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:34,580
insights and products such as the

916
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:37,270
Pathfinder and incidentally it was a

917
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:39,970
tribute to the human spirit

918
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:41,619
the more primitive and fragile gossamer

919
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:44,440
Condor was the first really successful

920
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:45,820
human powered airplane the final version

921
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,830
can be seen at the National Air and

922
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:50,560
Space Museum where it was installed

923
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:55,390
after this 1977 flight won the first

924
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:57,040
Cramer prize about this time the

925
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:58,530
International human powered vehicle

926
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,119
association was starting to organize

927
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:03,640
competitions for land vehicles without

928
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:08,050
the inhibiting effect of rules just go

929
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:11,140
as fast as you can the streamlined gold

930
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:13,690
rush finally exceeded 65 miles per hour

931
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:16,150
and a two-person version averaged over

932
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:18,430
50 miles an hour on a 40 mile freeway

933
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:20,230
trip later competition started to

934
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:22,450
include some less extreme practical

935
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:25,180
vehicle categories no match for our

936
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:27,310
wonderful modern cars but valuable and

937
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:29,710
suggesting that some transportation need

938
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:33,690
not involve large amounts of Steel and

939
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,690
oil and can be healthy in flight

940
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:39,489
pioneering for speed from human power

941
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:42,099
has resulted in some amazing water

942
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:44,349
vehicles this flying fish hydrofoil

943
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:47,469
lowers drag by flying on a submerged

944
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:49,569
wing it has been pedaled at 18 miles per

945
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:55,749

946
00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:57,880
racing shows in 1987 General Motors

947
00:45:55,749 --> 00:46:00,429
teamed with AeroVironment for the rapid

948
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,199
development of the GM Sun racer to be

949
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:04,269
entered in the world Solar Challenge to

950
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:07,390
cross Australia on energy from sunlight

951
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:10,059
it one speeding 50 percent faster than

952
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:11,999
the runner-up and averaging 42 miles per

953
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:14,199
hour on only a kilowatt of power

954
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:16,089
batteries to store the intermittent

955
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:18,369
energy from the Sun for vehicle use are

956
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:20,410
essential and obviously for non race

957
00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:22,509
purposes they can be charged from the

958
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:25,359
utility grid without need for solar

959
00:46:22,509 --> 00:46:27,699
cells this solar car race helped

960
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:31,630
emphasize that battery-powered cars can

961
00:46:27,699 --> 00:46:33,400
make sense next the same team combined

962
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:35,920
to create the battery power to impact

963
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,719
demonstrator to show that car is

964
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,099
emitting no pollution can be part of our

965
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:40,929
transportation future

966
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:43,420
it needed adequate range and snappy

967
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:46,029
acceleration here at zooms from zero to

968
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:48,160
60 miles per hour in eight seconds now

969
00:46:46,029 --> 00:46:50,079
many groups are increasing priorities on

battery powered vehicles vehicle

971
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:55,449

974
00:46:57,939 --> 00:47:02,650
solar powered cars now see more valuable

975
00:47:00,459 --> 00:47:04,929
as some of the ideas they ignited

976
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:10,269
evolved into socially desirable vehicles

977
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:11,949
aimed at a mass market globally bikes

978
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:13,900
are widely employed for personal

00:47:11,949 --> 00:47:16,869
mobility transport of goods and

980
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:18,999

a scaled-down version of electric car

982
00:47:18,999 --> 00:47:24,069
technology makes sense you can get the

983
00:47:21,549 --> 00:47:26,140
help of a virtual peddler here hidden in

984
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:28,539
the saddlebags who weighs only a few

985
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:30,939
pounds and never talks back not to turn

986
00:47:28,539 --> 00:47:33,160
your bicycle into a motorcycle but to

987
00:47:30,939 --> 00:47:35,420
let you do for 30 minutes what your

988
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,309
normal ability would let you do for only

989
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,530
three minutes you can extend your

990
00:47:37,309 --> 00:47:41,960
commuting range with this Bionic hybrid

991
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:43,940
that will never run out of gas you can

992
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,980
match performance between individuals or

993
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:50,270
not be bothered by hills on a hot

00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:52,430
afternoon a tiny airplane the a/b

995
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:54,829
pointers serves for surveillance in

996
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:56,839
effect a pair of roving eyeglasses a

997
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:59,000
cutting-edge example of wear of

998
00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:01,040
miniaturization can lead if the operator

999
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,290
is remote from the vehicle it is

1000
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,260
convenient to carry assemble and launch

1001
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:09,290
by hand battery-powered it is silent and

1002
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:11,839
rarely noticed it sends high-resolution

1003
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:14,299
video pictures back to the operator with

1004
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:17,359
onboard GPS it can navigate autonomously

1005
00:48:14,299 --> 00:48:21,589
and it is rugged enough to self land

1006
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:24,170
without damage the modern sail plane is

1007
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:26,750
superbly efficient some can glide as

1008
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:29,240
flat as 60 feet forward for every foot

1009
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:30,950
of descent they are powered only by the

1010
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,559
energy they can extract from the

1011
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:36,680
atmosphere and atmosphere nature stirs

1012
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:38,869
up by solar energy humans and soaring

1013
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,420
birds have found nature to be generous

1014
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:43,880
in providing replenishable energy sale

1015
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:48,520
plans have flown over 1,000 miles and

1016
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,520
the altitude record is over 50,000 feet

1017
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:56,130
the solar challenger was made to serve

1018
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:58,170
as a symbol that photovoltaic cells can

1019
00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:01,230
produce real power and will be part of

1020
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:04,050
the world's energy future in 1981 it

1021
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:06,360
flew 163 miles from Paris to England

1022
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:11,180
solely on the power of sunbeams and

1023
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:11,180
established a basis for the Pathfinder

1024
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:16,350
the message from all these vehicles is

1025
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:18,570
that ideas and technology can be

1026
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:22,020
harnessed to produce remarkable gains in

1027
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:24,270
doing more with less gains that can help

1028
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,820
us attain a desirable balance between

1029
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:29,160
technology and nature the stakes are

1030
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:30,290
high as we speed toward a challenging

1031
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,450
future

1032
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:35,370
Buckminster Fuller said it clearly there

1033
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:39,870
are no passengers on Spaceship Earth

1034
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:45,410
only crew we the crew can and must do

1035
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:56,880
more with less much less thank you

1036
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:56,880
[Applause]

1037
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:00,740
John Langston takes over

1038
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:13,260
thank you very much Paul and I'd like to

1039
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,110
say thank you very much to to ed Crawley

1040
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:18,960
for organizing this this is a great

1041
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:21,270
opportunity and a great event to to put

1042
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,530
two programs together here what I'd like

1043
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:24,660
to do if we could bring the first slide

1044
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:29,430
up and bring the lights down and the

1045
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:31,650
first slide up is to is to take up where

1046
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:34,320
where Paul left off in many ways in the

1047
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:36,810
story of human powered flight and talk

1048
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:39,360
for a few minutes about the the MIT side

1049
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:42,270
of it and in particular it's the the

1050
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,220
Daedalus project obviously that has

1051
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:46,110
epitomized this but I'd like to speak as

1052
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:48,420
well about the whole history of this

1053
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:50,820
with an emphasis on on the role of these

1054
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,160
these things as student teaching tools

1055
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:55,470
because they have played a unique role

1056
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:59,880
in the department over the last 20 years

1057
00:50:55,470 --> 00:51:03,780
or so this is the the famous image of

1058
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:07,290
Daedalus 88 arriving at at Santorini 10

1059
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:10,290
years ago just last week after about a

1060
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:13,200
four-hour flight over 72 miles a hundred

1061
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:15,690
and fifteen kilometers the product of a

1062
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,210
three-year program here at MIT and

1063
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:20,580
piloted by Canelo scan lopoliths and

1064
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:22,200
it's our very great pleasure to have

1065
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,580
Canelo's here today if you could stand

1066
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:27,680
up for a minute Kanellis this is his

1067
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,680
first time in the United States

1068
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:37,510
this is the first time that Canelo's has

1069
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:40,210
returned to MIT since he was here before

1070
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:43,510
the flight training and we're delighted

1071
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:46,510
to to have him and so many other members

1072
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:50,440
of the Daedalus team back as I mentioned

1073
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:52,360
the the project really goes back 20

1074
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,310
years or so and many of the themes that

1075
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,920
that that Paul was talking about a few

1076
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:59,350
minutes ago play right in in here that

1077
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,060
the the Kramer prize served as the

1078
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:03,370
impetus for and the stimulus for a

1079
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:06,310
number of student projects beginning

1080
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:08,170
here in the early 1970s this aircraft

1081
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:10,090
was one of two called the biplane

1082
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:11,950
ultralight research device our bird

1083
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:14,920
which were built here in the department

1084
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:18,010
by two teams of several teams of

1085
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,320
students during the early 1970s this was

1086
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:25,450
what the finished configuration looked

1087
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:30,670
like this was about a 60-foot span

1088
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:32,290
two-person aircraft and as Paul has has

1089
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:35,050
has just narrated the story of the

1090
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:37,300
gossamer Condor once the once the Condor

1091
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:39,750
one the the Kramer prized the first one

1092
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:42,400
in 1977 for the figure-of-eight flight

1093
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:45,970
interest in these in these projects

1094
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:48,820
languished somewhat as Paul mentioned

1095
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:50,920
there was a subsequent prize offered for

1096
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,140
cross-channel flight there had been a

1097
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:56,680
number of other activities here at MIT

1098
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:58,900
the one that that that our group

1099
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:01,210
particularly came out of was the model

1100
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,680
aircraft group and the the model rocket

1101
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:05,110
society which had been actually

1102
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,820
pioneering the techniques that that Paul

1103
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:08,890
showed a few minutes ago in that micro

1104
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:11,800
air vehicle flying around inside which

1105
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:15,130
is now a program supported by DARPA the

1106
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:17,020
Defense Projects Agency in the one of

1107
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:19,450
the big advances here at MIT in the late

1108
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:21,400
1970s was the miniaturization of radio

1109
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:24,130
control technology and its application

1110
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:26,950
to these small radio control boost

1111
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:29,920
gliders here flying for the US team in

1112
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:32,110
the World Championships in 1978 where

1113
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,860
Harald guppy younggren won the first

1114
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:37,350
World World Championship in in this was

1115
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:40,630
now

1116
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:43,120
the we got involved in the in the

1117
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:44,890
activity of human powered aircraft here

1118
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,330
you can see there's guppy the world

1119
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:49,830
champion on the right and professor

1120
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:53,290
Drella in the in the center driven by

1121
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:55,000
the the interest in in this as student

1122
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:59,590
project supposing supposed to be fun and

1123
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:00,820
interesting I think yeah as as Paul

1124
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:02,860
alluded to though there were some very

1125
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:05,380
serious aspects of this as well and and

1126
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:07,270
one of the first areas that that that

1127
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:09,760
the MIT group really was able to

1128
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:11,620
distinguish itself in was the design and

1129
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,660
the application of numerical methods to

1130
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:16,150
to airfoils and particularly to

1131
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:19,060
propellers and as G as as Paul mentioned

1132
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:21,580
Jean Larabee had was influential in this

1133
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:23,500
bringing the methods of Prandtl and bets

1134
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:25,510
and glowered and and updating them from

1135
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,730
for computer execution and it was really

1136
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:30,820
generation of students they're working

1137
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:33,310
under Jean that that coded that up and

1138
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:36,430
the the propeller became the first real

1139
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:39,850
visible implementation of this this is

1140
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:42,160
its mark hot-wiring a piece of that

1141
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:45,310
propeller these large four meter

1142
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:47,610
diameter props built-in in little 66

1143
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:50,110
inch long sections here and then

1144
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:52,360
obviously there was interchange back and

1145
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:55,900
forth all throughout this with with the

1146
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:59,680
with the two teams we were able to

1147
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:02,770
design the the propeller for the

1148
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,600
gossamer albatross aircraft and and and

1149
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:07,290
Paul contributed enormous ly to the

1150
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:10,240
efforts here at MIT providing a lot of

1151
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:11,770
tips about how these aircraft went

1152
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,440
together particularly the lessons from

1153
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:16,990
the Condor and the albatross experience

1154
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,210
and as well as providing material all of

1155
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:22,720
the year all of the skin covering the

1156
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:25,390
mylar for the first chrysalis aircraft

1157
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:28,260
that we built were donated by by Paul as

1158
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:31,810
part of this this is the spring of 1979

1159
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:33,640
guppy and and and Paul here and I think

1160
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:35,950
this is in Henry Jackson's backyard

1161
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,830
Henry is here today from from Santa

1162
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:41,140
Monica this was the aircraft that

1163
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:43,630
resulted from our efforts chrysalis a

1164
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:46,960
large biplane 70 foot two foot wingspan

1165
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:48,640
not really intended at the time to be a

1166
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,250
serious contender for the cross-channel

1167
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,440
prize

1168
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:55,160
but as a way of getting a new generation

1169
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:57,410
of MIT students into the air it was

1170
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:00,700
distinguished I think by by a number of

1171
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:03,170
firsts certainly at this point it had

1172
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:05,180
among the highest number of flights ever

1173
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:07,460
made something like 350 flights on this

1174
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:10,400
airframe without a crash or serious

1175
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:11,930
rebuild on it and holds at least one

1176
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,580
record that continues to stand which is

1177
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:15,800
to our knowledge the only person who's

1178
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:19,099
ever flown both under their own power

1179
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:22,250
and has flown in space as as J apt

1180
00:56:19,099 --> 00:56:24,740
another MIT graduate who who flew the

1181
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:28,900
chrysalis among many others in in the

1182
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:31,400
summer of 1979 their chrysalis project

1183
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:34,940
was overcome of course by the albatross

1184
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:37,670
which won the Cramer cross-channel prize

1185
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:40,790
in June of 79 a few days after chrysalis

1186
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:44,060
made its first flight which I think Paul

1187
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:46,760
has has narrated fabulously for us there

1188
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:48,349
and there was a subsequent series of of

1189
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,750
Kramer competitions called the speed

1190
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:53,240
prizes to make airplanes smaller and

1191
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:55,730
hopefully more practical we were able to

1192
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:58,250
to win first place in that competition

1193
00:56:55,730 --> 00:57:00,680
with an aircraft here called the monarch

1194
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:05,630
which flew in the nineteen was built and

1195
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:08,089
flown in 1983 and in 1984 out at out at

1196
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:11,180
Hanscom field there the idea here was to

1197
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:14,180
fly a sort of a metric mile flight 1,500

1198
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:16,790
meters in the first one in under three

1199
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:21,080
minutes I think one the the 30,000 pound

1200
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:23,150
prize for that to that flight that that

1201
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:26,480
was a great experience but the

1202
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:28,940
combination of the chrysalis experience

1203
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,330
the the monarch experience and the the

1204
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:34,400
gossamer series left a number of us

1205
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:36,859
wondering where this would lead if it

1206
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,380
wasn't driven by the by the impetus of

1207
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:41,030
these of the prizes the prizes certainly

1208
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:43,670
provided a good focus point but they

1209
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:45,580
also put an emphasis on how fast and how

1210
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:48,170
quick and dirty could you do this and

1211
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:50,180
there was an element to this of well if

1212
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:53,180
you didn't have that as a stimulus how

1213
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:54,680
and and you were just trying to to push

1214
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:56,330
it to the max how far could one of these

1215
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,400
things go how far had the technology

1216
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:59,990
really progressed because you have to

1217
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,339
remember it was moving very quickly in

1218
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:02,010
this period with computational

1219
00:58:01,339 --> 00:58:06,510
aerodynamic

1220
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:08,430
composite structures coming in how far

1221
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:10,590
could you push this and that led us into

1222
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:12,900
the thinking of what was it possible to

1223
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:15,000
take this all the way back to the to the

1224
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,400
oldest Western reference of man flying

1225
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,380
under his own initiative that is the

1226
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,970
story of Daedalus and Icarus which was

1227
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:23,280
the the team

1228
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:26,190
according to legend imprisoned on the

1229
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,800
island of Crete back in the Late Bronze

1230
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:33,750
Age who built wings of feathers and wax

1231
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:37,290
and flew to flew to to freedom to

1232
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:40,290
aircraft built there obviously the story

1233
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:43,140
most famous because of the to the the

1234
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:44,940
Sun Icarus flew in the story too close

1235
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:46,800
to the Sun which melted the wax holding

1236
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:49,740
the wings together and he fell to his

1237
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:51,920
death as as is true even to today the

1238
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:54,180
the crashes get all of the attention and

1239
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,730
history had pretty much neglected the

1240
00:58:54,180 --> 00:59:00,119
idea that his father Daedalus had made

1241
00:58:56,730 --> 00:59:04,440
it made it safely and that story became

1242
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:07,080
the the driving force behind the idea of

1243
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:09,840
the Daedalus project here at MIT in the

1244
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:11,340
middle 1980s this is the flight route

1245
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,410
when we when we first started on that

1246
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,730
project we we assumed rather naively

1247
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:16,410
that it would be possible as good

1248
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:17,760
engineers to go look all this up and

1249
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:20,130
find the exact flight route and

1250
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:22,290
literally recreate the the route the

1251
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:23,609
Daedalus had flown obviously as we began

1252
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:26,250
to get into that we learned a lot about

1253
00:59:23,609 --> 00:59:28,440
a lot about a lot of things during this

1254
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:29,730
project myth classical mythology being

1255
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:33,390
one of the first and of course that

1256
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:35,430
there is no literal recreation possible

1257
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:37,890
that myth-making is an a creative

1258
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:40,410
process and builds up over time but but

1259
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:43,490
applying the the navigational strategies

1260
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:45,869
of the day as Mariners practiced them to

1261
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:47,700
to the idea of flight it was pretty

1262
00:59:45,869 --> 00:59:50,730
clear that anybody who was trying to fly

1263
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:52,050
from Crete and Cano sews the ruins were

1264
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:53,970
actually discovered in the early part of

1265
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:56,550
the century here on the north part of

1266
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:59,640
Crete the nearest major landmass is up

1267
00:59:56,550 --> 01:00:02,340
here the island of Santorini which is 72

1268
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,720
miles or 115 kilometers about three

1269
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:06,480
times the distance of the cross-channel

1270
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:09,750
flight north of the island and whatever

1271
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,550
your eventual destination was and the

1272
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:14,340
myths do disagree on the eventual

1273
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:15,840
destination that that the first step

1274
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:18,930
would have been to get off to the island

1275
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:21,690
to get to that to to Santorini and so

1276
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:24,360
that became the the flight route that we

1277
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:26,520
undertook so we began looking into this

1278
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,870
there it was a research program not only

1279
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:30,390
in aeronautics as I mentioned but in

1280
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:32,130
many other areas the meteorology was an

1281
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:33,810
important one as we began to look into

1282
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:36,510
the to the the weather in the region

1283
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:38,310
obviously Paul talked a little about the

1284
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:39,660
difficulties that Brian faced both in

1285
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:42,120
terms of the physiology and the

1286
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:44,580
meteorology we began to address those

1287
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:46,500
right off the bat the existing weather

1288
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:47,880
database didn't have the resolution down

1289
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,980
in the low wind conditions that we

1290
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,660
needed so one of the first steps was to

1291
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,700
deploy a series of small automated

1292
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:55,560
weather stations there for a year or so

1293
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:58,710
before the flight as we looked for an

1294
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:01,320
envelope of of weather conditions calm

1295
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:02,580
wind for four four to six hours and low

1296
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,830
temperatures temperatures were very

1297
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:06,990
important because of the engine an

1298
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:09,450
engine research program was undertaken

1299
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:11,880
down at at Yale University

1300
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:14,520
this is dr. Ethan Adele who was the

1301
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:16,790
project's lead physiologist in a program

1302
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:19,680
that first attempted to sort of quantify

1303
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:21,390
what human performance really was so

1304
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:23,010
that we could use it as engineers input

1305
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:26,940
it into the aircraft sizing and and

1306
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:28,590
optimization models in addition to the

1307
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:30,840
physiology probably the single most

1308
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:33,360
important technical advance was

1309
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:36,300
numerical aerodynamics computational

1310
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,720
aerodynamics and as practiced by by Mark

1311
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,520
Drella

1312
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,920
I think those of you who attended the

1313
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,630
the symposium here it's really striking

1314
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,850
one of the real things that came out of

1315
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:46,020
this program Mark's codes now of course

1316
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:47,730
that may have been a criteria for

1317
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:49,590
getting invited to this symposium but I

1318
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:52,350
think that I think that every single

1319
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:55,320
speaker there on whichever coast or

1320
01:01:52,350 --> 01:01:58,590
continent is using a version of the ISIS

1321
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:00,150
or MCS or X rotor codes that that mark

1322
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,460
developed and that were first

1323
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:04,530
implemented here in the in the Daedalus

1324
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:06,870
project which provided the the

1325
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:08,730
aerodynamic designs on the on all of the

1326
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:12,810
flight surfaces propeller wing tails

1327
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:15,630
everything another big part of this was

1328
01:02:12,810 --> 01:02:17,730
the structures to get the kind of

1329
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:19,500
performance we were needing we really

1330
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:21,870
had to maintain large area of laminar

1331
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:24,060
flow that was partly computationally

1332
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:25,710
done through Mark's codes but then we

1333
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:27,330
had to implement that had to be the

1334
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:29,010
structures had to be built that were

1335
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:31,320
capable of sustaining that laminar

1336
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:34,140
floo and numerically controlled foam

1337
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:36,630
cutter was designed and built and used

1338
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:39,480
to precisely cut out the all of the

1339
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:41,070
different airfoil shapes that went into

1340
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,330
to covering the leading edge you can

1341
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:44,970
kind of look at the Daedalus and see

1342
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:45,900
that the pink areas are the areas of

1343
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:49,170
laminar flow

1344
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:51,600
obviously the foam isn't very very

1345
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:54,240
strong and you have to have a backbone

1346
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:57,510
to that which was the job of Juan Cruz

1347
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:59,810
who is now down at NASA Langley as their

1348
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:03,990
composites expert but this was a

1349
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:05,790
composite aircraft with one with one

1350
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:08,760
wire bracing and this is a picture of

1351
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:11,970
the of the full wing being proof loaded

1352
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:17,280
in a test out at out at the the Lincoln

1353
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:19,620
labs hangar I wanted to recognize the

1354
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:22,080
critical role played by Jack Kerouac in

1355
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:24,750
all of these projects because jack has

1356
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:26,220
been the project's advisor and sponsor

1357
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:28,590
in this every time we started one of

1358
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:30,120
these projects one of the well once we

1359
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:31,620
got past the initial brainstorming the

1360
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:34,920
first thing we had to do is go into Jack

1361
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:36,600
and ask for some money and in weather it

1362
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,730
was in his office here is department

1363
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:40,260
chair for chrysalis or when he was at

1364
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:41,910
monarch we had to go down to the nath he

1365
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:43,470
was a NASA associate administrator we

1366
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:45,540
had to go down to NASA and then when he

1367
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:47,070
was back for Daedalus he had moved up to

1368
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:50,280
the dean's office and Jack has been a

1369
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:51,960
critical supporter of this throughout

1370
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,160
the whole history and none of this would

1371
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,920
have happened I think without his

1372
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:58,410
without his support we got the support

1373
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,450
from unusual places one of the ones was

1374
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:03,690
the main sponsor for the prototype of

1375
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:07,020
the Daedalus was anheuser-busch and the

1376
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:09,300
aircraft was named by them the Michelob

1377
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:11,370
light eagle and obviously their target

1378
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:15,060
market was the college crowd here's tom

1379
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:16,950
clancy modeling for modeling for a for

1380
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:20,520
a-- and Iser busch ad i think in this

1381
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:24,630
one and that's the aircraft flying in in

1382
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:27,330
January of 1987 out over Rogers dry lake

1383
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:29,790
in California it was flown on for a

1384
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:33,620
series of five record flights by Louis

1385
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:36,510
Macallan and and Glenn Tremmel including

1386
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:38,910
records over straight-line and closed

1387
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:42,090
course records it broke the albatrosses

1388
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:43,080
record with a 37 mile flight and then

1389
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:44,820
the light eagle win

1390
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:47,760
and served as a testbed it was heavily

1391
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:49,260
instrumented you can see the different

1392
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,480
instrumentation that was put on it it

1393
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:53,820
became a real flight research aircraft

1394
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:57,180
collecting the the quantitative data

1395
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:59,070
that was needed both for the Daedalus

1396
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:01,020
airplane itself for subsequent human

1397
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:03,540
powered airplanes and also for some of

1398
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:05,340
the high-altitude things that that Paul

1399
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:07,620
alluded to the very lightweight very

1400
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:09,060
flexible structures that that you need

1401
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:11,790
in solar-powered aircraft for example

1402
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:13,950
this was a testbed NASA sponsored part

1403
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:15,810
of this part of the research program and

1404
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:18,150
there was a lot of instrumentation that

1405
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:19,650
went on the airplane of course all of

1406
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:21,450
you associated with the project know

1407
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:23,550
that the title of this picture is I

1408
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:29,250
don't understand it worked back in

1409
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:31,170
Cambridge by the time the the light

1410
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:33,630
eagle had completed its programme we

1411
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:35,610
moved into the into the Daedalus phase

1412
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:37,770
itself and we began the construction of

1413
01:05:35,610 --> 01:05:39,600
two very refined versions of the light

1414
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:42,240
eagle which were the actual Daedalus

1415
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:44,130
planes and at this point we began to

1416
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,230
transition to yet another generation of

1417
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:47,820
students the the UROP program the

1418
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:50,190
undergraduate research opportunities

1419
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:52,830
program played a big role in this this

1420
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:55,130
is as guppy here who served as the chief

1421
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:57,690
engineer on the on the Daedalus planes

1422
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:59,580
instructing Tom Clancy and some fine

1423
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:02,310
point of how these aircraft are built

1424
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:04,800
this is one with two other urops here

1425
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:07,170
and as in a composite test programme as

1426
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:09,150
we began every every piece of the

1427
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:11,910
structure in these in the Daedalus

1428
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:13,950
planes underwent proof load testing and

1429
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:17,190
then the numbers were fed back into the

1430
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:19,920
into the final designs and most of the

1431
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:22,740
construction was done done by the urops

1432
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,510
this this was at times a controversial

1433
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:26,820
strategy there were some members of the

1434
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:29,100
department who grumbled that the project

1435
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:31,380
was using the using the Yurok program

1436
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,490
for slave labour and it was it was never

1437
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:37,650
clear to me where they got that

1438
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:39,240
impression but anyway and we did work

1439
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:41,370
hard to employ everybody in the program

1440
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:43,350
the pilots even when they couldn't help

1441
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:45,780
build we put them to work here they are

1442
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:49,620
sewing patches onto the the team jackets

1443
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:52,440
the night before the rollout this was

1444
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:56,310
the the Daedalus plane as as finished in

1445
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:58,920
early well I guess late 1987 the

1446
01:06:56,310 --> 01:07:00,570
was in in October we always remember

1447
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:03,870
that because it was the day of the great

1448
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:05,460
1987 stock market crash and much to the

1449
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:07,170
dismay of the people from United

1450
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:09,330
Technologies because there was no

1451
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:12,690
mention of the Dedalus rollout because

1452
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:14,550
of the large crash there were other

1453
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:18,390
crashes later in the program this was

1454
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:20,460
this was one that occurred in January I

1455
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:23,640
guess actually early February of 1988

1456
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:25,850
this was about 21 days prior to the

1457
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:28,320
shipment to to Greece we had a Greek

1458
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:32,160
c-130 scheduled to come and pick the

1459
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:34,710
airplane up and we had four minutes of

1460
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:37,920
flight time and then we and then we had

1461
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:40,830
the airplane crash we lost the plane the

1462
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:45,780
first plane in in I guess that was

1463
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:48,510
February of 1988 fortunately we had been

1464
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:51,360
working on a backup and we brought the

1465
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:53,220
the wreckage of the first plane back the

1466
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:56,850
rush the completion of the second

1467
01:07:53,220 --> 01:08:01,550
airplane forward and by early March of

1468
01:07:56,850 --> 01:08:04,260
88 we had the second plane flying and

1469
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:08,010
the the cause of the accident was

1470
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:10,110
essentially a typical not uncommon in in

1471
01:08:08,010 --> 01:08:12,390
in engineering projects it's a failure

1472
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:14,070
to communicate among two parts of the

1473
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:15,750
engineering team and the design team and

1474
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:17,760
the fundamental problem was that the

1475
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:20,910
aircraft which had depended on its

1476
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:24,390
dihedral for for roll yaw coupling for

1477
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:26,640
for lateral control the the bracing wire

1478
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:28,560
which really controls that dihedral

1479
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,720
angle was cut too short and that wasn't

1480
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,609
caught in the manufacturing or checkout

1481
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:35,310
process and the aircraft didn't have

1482
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:37,680
adequate control once we had had traced

1483
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:39,750
that problem and analyzed it was very

1484
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,880
easy to fix and the second aircraft flew

1485
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:44,069
beautifully made us an abbreviated

1486
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:46,950
series of test flights and then was

1487
01:08:44,069 --> 01:08:49,920
packed up in a in a c-130 and and sent

1488
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:51,839
over two degrees once in Greece there

1489
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:54,450
was a lot going on there obviously the

1490
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:57,089
Aegean is a region noted for its

1491
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:59,430
changeable weather and the aircraft had

1492
01:08:57,089 --> 01:09:01,530
to be protected so the urops went to

1493
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:03,420
work again and we built a hangar we had

1494
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:04,680
we had purchased a prefabricated hangar

1495
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:07,109
and taken it over

1496
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:09,569
that team went over a few days ahead of

1497
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:10,170
time we had secured a small fleet of

1498
01:09:09,569 --> 01:09:12,020
inflatable

1499
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:14,540
boats which we had been loaned to us by

1500
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:16,890
several organizations over there the

1501
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:19,620
engines had been had been provided here

1502
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:21,509
in the United States and so we had we

1503
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:23,489
converted the the UROP team from

1504
01:09:21,509 --> 01:09:25,049
builders into boat teams the first

1505
01:09:23,489 --> 01:09:27,509
couple of drills here were pretty wild

1506
01:09:25,049 --> 01:09:29,310
with people overboard and radios that

1507
01:09:27,509 --> 01:09:31,770
went in the water and all of that that

1508
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:33,750
went into making the the flight but we

1509
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:36,420
had plenty of time to sort this out

1510
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:38,040
because as the meteorology got worked

1511
01:09:36,420 --> 01:09:39,960
through in the sious teague Solari here

1512
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:42,060
the director of flight operations on the

1513
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,529
program we we didn't get very many

1514
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:46,440
opportunities we knew that we wouldn't

1515
01:09:43,529 --> 01:09:49,109
have very many that we had five or six a

1516
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:50,790
year was the prediction and we were up

1517
01:09:49,109 --> 01:09:52,080
against a weather cutoff because it

1518
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:54,270
would get too hot in the summer we

1519
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:56,160
simply didn't have the capability to

1520
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:58,230
keep flying into the summer because of

1521
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:00,600
the high temperatures that we would

1522
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:03,390
encounter in the region we did have

1523
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:05,550
several false alarms or where we got up

1524
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:07,530
and put the went through the whole

1525
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:09,750
flight deployment drill had the pilot

1526
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:12,330
sealed up in the cockpit there sitting

1527
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:14,250
on the on the runway ready to go this is

1528
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:15,660
this is Mark and I guess that I think

1529
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:18,510
that's Frank Scotia and the in the

1530
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:20,250
cockpit on on this ready to go and then

1531
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:21,710
at the very last minute making the call

1532
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:24,570
of the world the conditions were not

1533
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:27,630
what we wanted all along the route and

1534
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:31,380
and scrubbing the flight and putting the

1535
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:33,510
whole thing thing back in there there

1536
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:35,820
was a lot of waiting the plane was ready

1537
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:38,310
and and there was a lot of waiting for

1538
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:41,429
which was which is a very anxious period

1539
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:45,270
it's a beautiful area there but it was

1540
01:10:41,429 --> 01:10:46,710
it was hard to relax and enjoy it

1541
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:48,840
waiting for this there was a lot of

1542
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:50,190
other dynamics going on I love this

1543
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,469
picture because it kind of captures all

1544
01:10:50,190 --> 01:10:54,239
of the players we were dealing with in

1545
01:10:52,469 --> 01:10:55,800
here the the military got involved

1546
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:58,080
because of course we were operating off

1547
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,520
a Greek military base that's pretty

1548
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,800
obvious the church was a little less

1549
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,750
obvious the church was involved because

1550
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,670
the issue came up of gee what if the

1551
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:07,679
weather was perfect on Easter Sunday and

1552
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:09,750
there was great debate within the team

1553
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,239
about how to handle that we finally went

1554
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:15,000
to the archbishop and and briefed him on

1555
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:17,400
the project and asked what his guidance

1556
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:21,530
was he he said go for it he said if the

1557
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:21,530
weather is good you guys go for it

1558
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:25,479
gasoline turned out to be another factor

1559
01:11:24,429 --> 01:11:26,650
that you wouldn't have thought would be

1560
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:28,900
a limit in a human-powered aircraft

1561
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:32,229
obviously the airplane didn't need it

1562
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:34,209
but all the boats did and this was the

1563
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:38,409
the supplies that were needed for one

1564
01:11:34,209 --> 01:11:40,929
day of flying or the boats the boat

1565
01:11:38,409 --> 01:11:43,090
support for day of flight operations

1566
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:44,769
there the the people who kept the

1567
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:47,860
busiest I think were the pilots we had a

1568
01:11:44,769 --> 01:11:50,590
team of five of them on rotation this

1569
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:53,079
was because we had had figured that this

1570
01:11:50,590 --> 01:11:56,439
was going to be right at the limit of of

1571
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:59,349
what any human physiology was capable of

1572
01:11:56,439 --> 01:12:02,019
and we had recruited and trained five

1573
01:11:59,349 --> 01:12:03,670
world-class athletes who were in a in a

1574
01:12:02,019 --> 01:12:06,400
rotation much like baseball pitchers

1575
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:09,880
where they were on for two days and then

1576
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:11,469
you know in a rotation cycle off for for

1577
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:13,449
six or eight days depending on how many

1578
01:12:11,469 --> 01:12:17,199
were healthy obviously injuries for

1579
01:12:13,449 --> 01:12:19,449
another big another big part of this so

1580
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:23,139
the the training regime was very

1581
01:12:19,449 --> 01:12:26,769
important they were riding hundreds of

1582
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:28,179
miles each day in the to train they

1583
01:12:26,769 --> 01:12:30,280
obviously came into the project as

1584
01:12:28,179 --> 01:12:31,989
excellent athletes they were all Olympic

1585
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:34,659
level cyclists when they joined the

1586
01:12:31,989 --> 01:12:36,159
project and in the course of the project

1587
01:12:34,659 --> 01:12:37,719
they were all trained to be highly

1588
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:39,670
skilled pilots a lot of that was in

1589
01:12:37,719 --> 01:12:43,090
high-performance sailplanes they started

1590
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:44,340
in and obviously lower training

1591
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:46,719
sailplanes and quickly moved into

1592
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:48,429
high-performance sailplanes a lot of the

1593
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:51,340
training took place on a simulator which

1594
01:12:48,429 --> 01:12:53,469
combined a visual alpha window display

1595
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:54,849
with an ergometer your power was

1596
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:57,099
actually being measured here as you

1597
01:12:54,849 --> 01:12:59,439
pedaled and that power reading was fed

1598
01:12:57,099 --> 01:13:03,189
into the into the simulation and

1599
01:12:59,439 --> 01:13:06,070
displayed so you had the full flight

1600
01:13:03,189 --> 01:13:08,170
controls as well as the the power going

1601
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:09,489
into the simulation and then once all of

1602
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:11,019
that was completed you would fly the

1603
01:13:09,489 --> 01:13:12,729
light eagle the light eagle had become

1604
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:14,650
the training airplane and once you had

1605
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:16,090
gone through this regime you flew the

1606
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:18,130
eagle and one of the requirements was

1607
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:20,979
you had to get through a minimum of two

1608
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:22,479
hours of a two hour long flight a number

1609
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:24,939
of flights in the eagle including one at

1610
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:27,909
least two hours long before you could

1611
01:13:24,939 --> 01:13:29,920
get into into the into the Daedalus and

1612
01:13:27,909 --> 01:13:32,499
once you had gone through all of that

1613
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,320
you were checked out to fly the Daedalus

1614
01:13:32,499 --> 01:13:37,400
this is the this is

1615
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:41,480
one pilots food ration for one day and

1616
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:43,260
it's it's pretty amazing the the

1617
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:45,510
nutritionists from shaklee corporation

1618
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:47,430
who were a sponsor at this time helped

1619
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:50,010
go over and sort of rewrote the whole

1620
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:53,130
diet of the of the kitchen in the in the

1621
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:54,840
place we were staying and the pilots the

1622
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:56,130
pilots had this at first all the rest of

1623
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,980
the team was pretty envious of this

1624
01:13:56,130 --> 01:14:00,420
because this looked pretty good but the

1625
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:02,040
then it turned out as the day wore on

1626
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:04,380
and they realized that these guys had to

1627
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:06,390
eat the same thing every day it became a

1628
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:08,280
little less attractive the the rest of

1629
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:10,770
the team got to got to vary their their

1630
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:12,990
meal a little bit more the in-flight

1631
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:15,330
meal service was provided by ethan Nadel

1632
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:17,970
yeah this is ethan all as we called it

1633
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:20,280
it was a very high-performance drink

1634
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:21,840
which had been optimized to be right at

1635
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:23,900
the limits of what a human could

1636
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:27,690
tolerate in the system in terms of of

1637
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:31,170
replenishing the the glycogen in that

1638
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:34,410
you needed to keep your keep your your

1639
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:35,910
muscles functioning and Ethan had had

1640
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:39,020
moved into this and had developed this

1641
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:41,730
drink had had debugged it on the pilots

1642
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:44,970
through various versions and the there's

1643
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:46,920
actually a toned-down version consumer

1644
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:50,340
version I think that Shaklee is still is

1645
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:51,810
still marketing there were what was it

1646
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:53,070
six quarts of that on the on the

1647
01:14:51,810 --> 01:14:57,150
airplane or something like that six

1648
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:58,650
litres four litres after a period of

1649
01:14:57,150 --> 01:15:00,600
what seemed like interminable waiting

1650
01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:03,210
was probably more like three weeks now

1651
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:05,100
in retrospect but we finally did get a

1652
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:08,430
day where things begin to really line up

1653
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:12,300
across the the whole Aegean and the the

1654
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:14,460
crew was brought out that I guess the

1655
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:17,100
2:00 a.m. wake-up and the Assembly of

1656
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:20,730
the aircraft it began at about 4:00 in

1657
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:23,940
the morning and the plane was put

1658
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:26,460
together there on the runway a lot of

1659
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:30,630
white knuckles in the boats and watching

1660
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:32,760
as we got ready and then Kanellis was

1661
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:35,400
given the go-ahead and and took off I

1662
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:38,880
mentioned that Kanellis was the pilot by

1663
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:40,710
by luck of the draw here that that his

1664
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:43,650
number was came up on the day that the

1665
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:45,960
the weather conditions were good and so

1666
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:47,829
shortly after 7:00 a.m. can almost took

1667
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:50,889
off from this runway and

1668
01:15:47,829 --> 01:15:53,439
and went over the edge of this of this

1669
01:15:50,889 --> 01:15:55,510
embankment here and headed out and the

1670
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:57,909
airplane which had looked so huge when

1671
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:59,439
we were up close to it suddenly looked

1672
01:15:57,909 --> 01:16:02,199
completely different in terms of

1673
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:04,809
something it was tiny has as he set out

1674
01:16:02,199 --> 01:16:06,219
on this on this flight you can see in

1675
01:16:04,809 --> 01:16:08,859
the background there the big ferries

1676
01:16:06,219 --> 01:16:11,499
that go every night to and from from

1677
01:16:08,859 --> 01:16:12,969
Athens and you can see the inflatables

1678
01:16:11,499 --> 01:16:15,969
that are accompanying it in case the

1679
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:17,530
aircraft had to had to ditch we were

1680
01:16:15,969 --> 01:16:20,139
prepared to take the airplane under tow

1681
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:23,099
we had tried to absorb all of the

1682
01:16:20,139 --> 01:16:25,599
lessons from the Albatross project and

1683
01:16:23,099 --> 01:16:27,039
albatrosses strategy for example was

1684
01:16:25,599 --> 01:16:28,839
that I had to take a fishing line and

1685
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:31,479
try to hook a ring on the aircraft

1686
01:16:28,839 --> 01:16:33,189
Daedalus had I had a refine system that

1687
01:16:31,479 --> 01:16:34,629
had the tow line in the airplanes on the

1688
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:36,249
event that Kanellis wanted to be taken

1689
01:16:34,629 --> 01:16:38,889
under tow he would have dropped the line

1690
01:16:36,249 --> 01:16:41,649
and and the the boat underneath taken it

1691
01:16:38,889 --> 01:16:46,030
up and towed it navigation was done from

1692
01:16:41,649 --> 01:16:48,159
a command boat following behind the the

1693
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:50,289
aircraft there this is a nice shot

1694
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:52,989
looking up you can see the see the

1695
01:16:50,289 --> 01:16:55,119
carbon structure there and the region of

1696
01:16:52,989 --> 01:16:57,789
laminar flow on the top it really is

1697
01:16:55,119 --> 01:16:59,050
laminar back to about 60% pretty much

1698
01:16:57,789 --> 01:17:01,839
you can see where the where the foam

1699
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:03,699
foam goes to on the on the top surface

1700
01:17:01,839 --> 01:17:05,499
the bottom is almost all laminar it

1701
01:17:03,699 --> 01:17:06,760
didn't need the the foam and you get

1702
01:17:05,499 --> 01:17:10,479
another view this is looking straight

1703
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:16,179
down on the aircraft and again a good

1704
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:18,579
view of the laminar flow we had escorts

1705
01:17:16,179 --> 01:17:20,469
provided by the the Greek Navy and the

1706
01:17:18,579 --> 01:17:23,649
Greek Coast Guard they were there their

1707
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:26,999
primary role was for in case we needed

1708
01:17:23,649 --> 01:17:29,619
any emergency medical rescue that was

1709
01:17:26,999 --> 01:17:32,019
provided by the by the boats and they

1710
01:17:29,619 --> 01:17:34,119
also helped keep the keep the route

1711
01:17:32,019 --> 01:17:36,369
clear from other from other boats that

1712
01:17:34,119 --> 01:17:38,859
would have gotten in the way this is a

1713
01:17:36,369 --> 01:17:41,519
great picture gives you a sense of the

1714
01:17:38,859 --> 01:17:44,109
speed at which Kanellis was was flying

1715
01:17:41,519 --> 01:17:47,019
and also the crosswinds that he was

1716
01:17:44,109 --> 01:17:48,999
managing you can see the the crab in

1717
01:17:47,019 --> 01:17:51,579
there the boats obviously and the wakes

1718
01:17:48,999 --> 01:17:56,199
are marking the the direct flight route

1719
01:17:51,579 --> 01:17:58,439
to Santorini there and and this picture

1720
01:17:56,199 --> 01:18:00,810
gives you a good sense of the smooth

1721
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:03,720
surface of the upper upper part

1722
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:05,340
the wing this is a another good example

1723
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:07,890
of the doing more with less that Paul

1724
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:09,810
was just talking about where the the

1725
01:18:07,890 --> 01:18:13,380
speedboat there has what is that is that

1726
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:15,330
a 120 horse motor on the 130 horse motor

1727
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:18,120
on the on the back of that speedboat

1728
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:20,340
there the Daedalus has a quarter

1729
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:23,580
horsepower motor in it and they're going

1730
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:25,650
the same speed and it's all it's all due

1731
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:28,290
to the refinement of the technology and

1732
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:33,090
the application of technology to to to

1733
01:18:28,290 --> 01:18:35,370
energy efficiency here the the flight

1734
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:38,490
had been projected to take as long as

1735
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:40,440
six hours we train for six hours but the

1736
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:43,230
conditions were good and and and

1737
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:44,730
Kanellis was just fantastic his heart

1738
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:47,340
rate when he started was about a hundred

1739
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:48,960
and fifty six and declined throughout

1740
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:50,970
the flight by the time we were inside of

1741
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:54,660
santorini his heart rate was down to 126

1742
01:18:50,970 --> 01:18:57,720
which still his absence just boggles my

1743
01:18:54,660 --> 01:19:00,030
mind how cool he was and throughout all

1744
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:01,590
of this we had actually by this time

1745
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:05,600
most of the team had deployed to the

1746
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:08,760
landing site and was was was watching

1747
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:11,190
marking the the site there with with

1748
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:13,050
smoke and then Kanellis had the choice

1749
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:14,460
of going straight in onto the beach a

1750
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:17,580
lot has been made of the fact that the

1751
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:19,320
aircraft broke up we were I'm here to

1752
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:21,090
say we were maneuvering this thing to

1753
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,680
try to get it back in one piece can also

1754
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:24,630
easily could have gone straight in onto

1755
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:26,460
the beach if the objective was to was

1756
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:28,890
just to get it onto the onto the beach

1757
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:30,930
but we really wanted to try to maneuver

1758
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:33,420
the airplane in and land it we had all

1759
01:19:30,930 --> 01:19:35,250
seen that Society of Brian Allen

1760
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:37,200
slipping it in there under the beach in

1761
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:38,640
France and that was pretty much the

1762
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:40,830
maneuver we were working on here so

1763
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:43,080
Kanellis came in at fairly high speed

1764
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:46,590
turns in parallel to the beach and tries

1765
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:49,410
to to slip it in parallel here you can

1766
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:50,610
see the the beginning of the fail you

1767
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:53,220
can actually see the buckling right

1768
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:55,620
there in the in the carbon tail boom as

1769
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:57,720
the as a gust of wind thermally induced

1770
01:19:55,620 --> 01:20:00,330
coming off this black sand catches this

1771
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:03,210
torques the tail tail fails right there

1772
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:05,100
the tail boom fails the wires are the

1773
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:06,900
cables that control the elevator are

1774
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:10,890
outside at that point says this torques

1775
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:13,130
that puts a full command on the on the

1776
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:15,380
horizontal stabbed there

1777
01:20:13,130 --> 01:20:17,360
/ stresses the way it fails out and

1778
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:18,730
right near a transport joint on the on

1779
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:22,400
the right hand side and the aircraft

1780
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:25,190
drops into the into the into the water

1781
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:27,350
they are just off off the shore we had a

1782
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:30,230
lot of people help us take it apart at

1783
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:31,820
this point that was the problem there if

1784
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:34,580
you go to Santorini I'm sure there's

1785
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:36,710
still pink pink foam souvenirs in some

1786
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:39,070
of the shops there and and there's

1787
01:20:36,710 --> 01:20:41,510
Kanellis after the after the flight

1788
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:45,710
whoo-hoo no kidding could have gone on

1789
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:48,980
for for quite a while on this flight

1790
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:50,570
and that's the team there on the on the

1791
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:52,370
beach many of whom are here today could

1792
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:54,020
I get everybody who is on the team to

1793
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:57,880
stand up at this point everybody who

1794
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:57,880
worked on the project could you stand

1795
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:18,219
many of the people I think haven't seen

1796
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:20,920
each other in 10 years after this and I

1797
01:21:18,219 --> 01:21:21,820
really do thank ed Crawley for pulling

1798
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:24,670
this whole thing together

1799
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:26,080
well the devilís project always you know

1800
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:28,270
it was done for education it was done

1801
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:30,250
for research it was a marvelous project

1802
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:32,380
it could never answer the question of so

1803
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:34,570
what and when people asked it in the

1804
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:37,120
lectures but but one of the interesting

1805
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:38,890
things about science is that it really

1806
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:41,920
when you really are doing research is

1807
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:43,719
that that you never know where the the

1808
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,940
next problem is going to come from in it

1809
01:21:43,719 --> 01:21:48,580
and in Daedalus for me anyway it came

1810
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:50,230
from a very unexpected source in in the

1811
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:51,760
mid-80s there were two things that

1812
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:54,670
emerged that kind of shifted the

1813
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,260
paradigm from nuclear holocaust being

1814
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:59,530
the sort of you know big picture issue

1815
01:21:56,260 --> 01:22:01,360
that that that kind of hung over all of

1816
01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:03,070
us and those two issues were the

1817
01:22:01,360 --> 01:22:05,199
emergence of AIDS the break out of that

1818
01:22:03,070 --> 01:22:06,910
into the general population and the

1819
01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:08,560
depletion of stratospheric ozone in

1820
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:10,870
terms of issues that when they first

1821
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,699
began to appear no one was quite sure

1822
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:16,030
how bad this was going to be and that

1823
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:20,620
clearly had the potential to to to

1824
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:22,929
eliminate life as as we knew it if in a

1825
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:24,910
worst-case scenario the the ozone hole

1826
01:22:22,929 --> 01:22:28,090
obviously appeared over Antarctica in

1827
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:29,739
the in the early 80s and in the mid 80s

1828
01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:32,290
a lot of attention was directed towards

1829
01:22:29,739 --> 01:22:34,360
figuring out exactly what it was the

1830
01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:37,150
primary tools for doing that were large

1831
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:38,830
stratospheric balloons and the an

1832
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:41,110
aircraft called the ER to which NASA

1833
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:44,230
operates it's a version of the military

1834
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:46,900
spy plane and these worked okay for

1835
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:49,420
figuring out the for the causes of the

1836
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:51,060
Antarctic ozone hole and and providing

1837
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:53,320
the conclusive links between

1838
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:54,969
chlorofluorocarbons and the and the

1839
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:57,130
catalytic cycles that destroyed the

1840
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:58,630
ozone but it was also clear that the

1841
01:22:57,130 --> 01:23:00,520
scientists to answer the question of is

1842
01:22:58,630 --> 01:23:01,870
this going to spread to other places on

1843
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,969
the planet is this going to happen in

1844
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:05,770
the northern hemisphere is it going to

1845
01:23:03,969 --> 01:23:07,750
happen over the middle latitudes that

1846
01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:09,580
you needed to go out and take

1847
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:12,280
measurements at higher altitudes and in

1848
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:14,380
more places around the planet and a

1849
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:16,390
couple of us from from the Daedalus

1850
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:18,219
project linked up with a group down at

1851
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:20,679
Harvard in the atmospheric research

1852
01:23:18,219 --> 01:23:22,300
project there and began construction of

1853
01:23:20,679 --> 01:23:24,930
a series of aircraft that would attempt

1854
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:27,300
to apply the aerodynamics and the

1855
01:23:24,930 --> 01:23:29,190
structures and some of the project

1856
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:32,060
management philosophies that came out of

1857
01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:36,030
Daedalus and applied them to a series of

1858
01:23:32,060 --> 01:23:37,590
small very customized robotic aircraft

1859
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:39,510
that could be used for atmospheric

1860
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:42,630
science high altitude research initially

1861
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:46,050
in the ozone area and we built an

1862
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:49,260
aircraft just called Perseus about 60 62

1863
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:51,120
feet in in wingspan developed the

1864
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:53,760
controls technology for that and made a

1865
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:55,890
series of flights this is really to give

1866
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:59,610
you a sense of scale of the of the

1867
01:23:55,890 --> 01:24:03,660
Perseus this particular aircraft has

1868
01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:05,910
carried about a 220 pound payload to an

1869
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:08,460
altitude of about 50,000 feet and and

1870
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:11,520
both the solar plane and the the Perseus

1871
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:13,710
aircraft are are working together our

1872
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,930
joint participants in a NASA program

1873
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:19,890
that's developing the technology for

1874
01:24:15,930 --> 01:24:21,780
future operational aircraft and we've

1875
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:22,980
also applied that to it to a larger

1876
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:24,690
aircraft that's really designed

1877
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:27,420
specifically around the needs of the

1878
01:24:24,690 --> 01:24:29,730
scientists called Theseus and that's the

1879
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:32,160
larger twin-engine aircraft in the back

1880
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:34,680
and we have built this is a hundred and

1881
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:39,390
forty foot wingspan aircraft that

1882
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:42,390
carries between 750 and and 1,500 pounds

1883
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:44,760
of of instruments on board and the

1884
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:47,070
eventually to altitudes of 85,000 feet

1885
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:48,930
or so for four fairly long Endurance's

1886
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:52,290
this is an airplane that's in in

1887
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:56,640
development and it's a direct outgrowth

1888
01:24:52,290 --> 01:25:00,090
of the Daedalus technologies I wanted to

1889
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:01,350
what to close here and and if I had the

1890
01:25:00,090 --> 01:25:05,460
time if I have the time here which I

1891
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:08,790
think I do Cory are you can you cue up

1892
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:10,260
the short video before as you put that

1893
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:15,300
in I just wanted to close with a few

1894
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:17,490
thoughts here on yeah on this this

1895
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:19,650
picture which is the layered structure

1896
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:23,130
of the of the atmosphere here which is

1897
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:25,680
which is is really a neat picture

1898
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:27,810
showing the whole the whole path here

1899
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:29,040
and I think the the lessons that Paul

1900
01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:30,660
has been talking about certainly the

1901
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:33,630
lessons that we have drawn from Daedalus

1902
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:35,940
support very much the idea that the the

1903
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:37,840
atmosphere is although it looks very

1904
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:39,790
large it looks like it's a

1905
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,790
and NSYNC for many purposes it really

1906
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:46,270
isn't if you look at this picture above

1907
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:50,590
that line is space a very hostile

1908
01:25:46,270 --> 01:25:52,960
environment below that line is is earth

1909
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:55,660
and everything on it that we we know and

1910
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:57,700
hold dear and that atmosphere is a very

1911
01:25:55,660 --> 01:25:59,890
thin line that separates those those two

1912
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:01,900
from each other it's it's amazingly

1913
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:06,730
undersampled there's still a lot to be

1914
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:08,110
done and there to the future generations

1915
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:09,760
of students who are coming along

1916
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:12,610
hopefully some of whom are in the room

1917
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,170
attending this lecture today there is

1918
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:15,790
still a lot to be done and these types

1919
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:19,270
of programs that Paul and I have talked

1920
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:21,040
about here are great ways to to get into

1921
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:24,610
it it's like - if you can cue up this

1922
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:27,160
this video this is a piece that Brian

1923
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:29,400
Sullivan edited together of the of the

1924
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,400
flight

1925
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,160
you

1926
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:11,650
okay thank you very very much

1927
01:32:20,310 --> 01:32:24,930
well I think we have a chance to

1928
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:38,850
entertain a few few questions from the

1929
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:40,080
audience and then we'll wrap up why

1930
01:32:38,850 --> 01:32:41,250
don't Kanellis why don't you come down

1931
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:44,390
here and tell us that and then we'll

1932
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:44,390
then we'll close on that

1933
01:32:58,099 --> 01:33:03,409
first you first thank you for the

1934
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:08,989
opportunity give me the talk sorry for

1935
01:33:03,409 --> 01:33:15,139
my bad english about the the last moment

1936
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:18,340
you know there when I was pedaling in

1937
01:33:15,139 --> 01:33:21,949
towards to Santorini was the tailwind so

1938
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:27,500
no problem no big problems and over

1939
01:33:21,949 --> 01:33:34,099
there as John said because of the high

1940
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:37,849
speed we had they decide to make me do a

1941
01:33:34,099 --> 01:33:41,500
turn so we did the turn but during the

1942
01:33:37,849 --> 01:33:45,230
turn we face the wind and the wind

1943
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:47,869
approaching the land was too hard so the

1944
01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:49,699
plane was going up and down like you

1945
01:33:47,869 --> 01:33:56,929
have seen there this plane was not

1946
01:33:49,699 --> 01:34:01,639
designed to do all those things so it

1947
01:33:56,929 --> 01:34:04,639
resisted too much and one moment I felt

1948
01:34:01,639 --> 01:34:06,469
no it was not my feeling was real the

1949
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:09,860
plane was flying but staying in the same

1950
01:34:06,469 --> 01:34:16,360
place because they wind had the speed of

1951
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:20,389
the plane so it was very tough and then

1952
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:26,389
he took a bank you know and it was not

1953
01:34:20,389 --> 01:34:28,880
possible to make it return back so he

1954
01:34:26,389 --> 01:34:32,739
did once he did twice and then broken

1955
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:36,860
the the tail so it was but it was closed

1956
01:34:32,739 --> 01:34:38,829
but I think this this end because was

1957
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:43,940
not so easy and smooth like the other

1958
01:34:38,829 --> 01:34:46,639
make a very you know put fear to someone

1959
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:49,060
else who wants to do the same that is

1960
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,060
not so easy

1961
01:34:58,150 --> 01:35:02,420
well with that I think we'll will

1962
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:03,880
conclude this year's Gardner lecture

1963
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:10,880
thank you very much for coming

1964
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:10,880
[Applause]
