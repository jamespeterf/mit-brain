1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,759
So now let's switch over and talk about

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:08,160
how the data looks uh and uh the the

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,960
data object that you'll be um receiving

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,880
to work with. So two packages that will

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:18,160
be uh relevant for you um by way of

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,359
introduction are scanpie and data. Uh,

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,760
scanpie is a very commonly uh used

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,279
package in Python in the single cell

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,560
community

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:32,160
and data uh is a package within that

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,719
that is specifically um very useful for

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,280
uh dealing with these single cell gene

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,680
expression matrices and the associated

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,239
uh metadata that they might have such as

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,480
the pertubation uh identity that we've

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,480
been discussing.

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,520
And so here I've just provided um some

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,239
very kind of initial code that you might

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,399
want to use uh to import some of these

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,320
packages um and work with their

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,039
functions. And so going a little bit

22
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:06,479
more into uh the and data um package. So

23
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,119
um you will be able to use it to read in

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,799
uh the uh data that we'll provide to

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:16,240
you. uh so with this function scread h5

26
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,960
ad and uh if we actually then look at

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,720
what the resulting a data object is here

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,280
you can see that it's made up of

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,840
multiple objects but the two really key

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,280
ones in here are first of all uh this

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,479
green uh matrix x which you can access

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,439
uh by writing a data dox uh and so this

33
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,880
is the single cell uh expression matrix

34
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,560
um that you um will be familiar with by

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,400
now and that generated from the

36
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,640
perturbse experiments. Uh and the other

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,920
um particularly relevant object here is

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,439
this obs uh object which you can access

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,399
by uh a data obs. And this will give you

40
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,439
uh associated metadata for the cells uh

41
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,840
in the expression matrix. So we can see

42
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,320
um every row here is a cell and we can

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,560
see uh in the second column uh the

44
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,959
pertubation assignment. So again,

45
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,760
whether this was let's say MLXPL that

46
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,560
was knocked out um or another gene or a

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,480
non-targeting control

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,040
and there's another column that we'll

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,319
provide which will be uh the assignment

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,440
of cells um based on high expression of

51
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,599
certain uh programs. So uh for example

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,239
you can see uh a differentiated

53
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,680
adiposite program that um was high in

54
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,440
cells two and three and five. And so

55
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,200
diving into these objects a little bit

56
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,000
more uh we can see first of all uh this

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,760
just tells us the shape of the um a data

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,959
dox object. So the gene expression

59
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,160
matrix um which should correspond to the

60
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,040
number of uh observations i.e the cells

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,680
times the number of um v variables or

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,920
features which are the genes.

63
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,239
Uh we can also uh use this to show just

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,800
the first few uh cells and genes. to the

65
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,800
first five cells and genes uh expression

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:12,720
values uh in the a data.x matrix.

67
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,239
Similarly, we can use a data uh obsc

68
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:21,440
names to see uh the names of the first

69
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:24,959
five cells or the unique cell ids.

70
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,560
Uh and finally uh similarly we can write

71
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,840
a data.var var names to see uh the names

72
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,560
or the ids of uh the genes that are uh

73
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,560
again the first five uh columns in the

74
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,560
matrix.
