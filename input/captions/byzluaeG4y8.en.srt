1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,400
I always love to talk after lunch

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
because my

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,240
my research is about food and

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,080
agriculture and so typically I can

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,160
relate

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,840
and I can give you many examples of what

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,359
you have eaten and how they've been

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,359
processed and how nanotechnology

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,359
enables the food and agriculture

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,000
business. But today we're not here to

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,760
talk about me. Today we're here to talk

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,440
about climate resilience and how

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,960
nanotechnology can support a society

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,440
that is more resilient to climate

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,440
change. And we have three amazing

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,200
speakers like these are really really

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,719
good top class speakers. So I'm very

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,600
happy that they um that they join us and

19
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,360
they're going to talk about the

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,719
research. Before doing that though, I

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,280
would like to give a mention and um

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,600
further resonate the speech that uh

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,399
President Kro gave this morning about

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,000
the importance of innovating in climate

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,520
and particularly she started as

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,640
presidential initiative the climate

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,400
project which I uh I'm part of and

28
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,960
really the climate project is a brand

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,920
new initiative that uh she launched and

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,240
the idea is to convey all the faculty to

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,119
work together to have an impact uh on

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,280
climate and also energy. of course with

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,119
the idea that we're going to have a

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,920
tangible impact on the trajectory of

35
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:30,240
climate change in the next 10 years.

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,920
We cannot do it alone. And so the what

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,759
the climate project wants to do is

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,920
really to uh leverage all the different

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,759
entities that are already part of MIT

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,280
and to work with them so that the

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,960
faculty can work to uh innovate in

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,880
climate

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,880
and particularly we see the project as

44
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,880
an ecosystem for innovation in deep

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,439
tech. So we really want MIT to become

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,920
the hub that puts together industry

47
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,240
incubators, investors, foundations, the

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,240
startups that come out of our uh

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,320
university together with the government,

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,520
national lab and other university

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,560
partners to work together to innovate in

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,720
the realm of climate. As you may know,

53
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,080
innovating climate is extremely

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,840
difficult. Uh the economy is developing.

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
There are no real models that can be

56
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,599
used particularly for uh some

57
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,080
technologies. And so this ecosystem for

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,200
innovation would particularly be focused

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,480
on innovation at scale and it's very

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,760
interesting because we talk about this

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,480
at the nano uh summit and nano is 10 to

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,360
minus 9 as you know and for climate we

63
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,239
need to go 10 to the 9 and up right so

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,120
we need to cover 18 order of magnitudes

65
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,560
even 20 so that's really the beauty the

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,800
challenge and the opportunities that

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,440
we're having and we really really need

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,720
to work as

69
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,400
as whole to solve this problem.

70
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,760
Uh the vision is summarized in the

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,000
well-being of humanity and prosperity of

72
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,800
humanity and to do that we need to take

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,280
care of ecology, health, mobility, the

74
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,159
built environment, food, energy,

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,319
policies and trade and industry. And so

76
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,040
really putting this at the center of

77
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,440
innovation of campus and thinking about

78
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,840
these topics as interconnected topic to

79
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,560
have a positive impact on our climate.

80
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,760
Um the climate change is or sorry the

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,280
climate change the climate project is

82
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,200
organized uh in different key areas and

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,280
we have six faculty leadership and as

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,959
you can see I'm one of them and

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,040
particularly I'm leading an effort that

86
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,879
is called the wild cards which are

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,440
high-risk high payoff projects that um

88
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,280
if successful can have a big big impact

89
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,799
uh on changing the trajectory of climate

90
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,680
change but of course they're also high

91
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,280
risk. We as area of interest we have

92
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,239
decarbonizing the energy and the

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,440
industry empowering frontline community

94
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,680
which are going to be the one most

95
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,239
affected by climate change. We need to

96
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,439
redesign uh resilience at prosperous

97
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,159
cities. We need to enable new policy to

98
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,000
be able to translate and then we have a

99
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,319
a focus on science. So what's the

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,840
science that um interests the

101
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,000
atmosphere, the land and the oceans and

102
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,319
then of course the wild card that I just

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,840
discussed. Um the one of the one of the

104
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,079
help that we want to give to faculty

105
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,560
through the climate project is to assess

106
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,880
priorities, identify gaps in knowledge

107
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,400
and technologies and then put several

108
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,360
faculty together in DARPA style program

109
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,680
that can be launched and that can um

110
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,680
really make an impact on the

111
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,680
technologies. We also support cutting um

112
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,360
crosscutting research among different

113
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,720
missions. particularly we recently

114
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,120
launched a two projects one on sensure

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,199
and understand climate and one related

116
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,720
to heat stress and cooling and I just

117
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,120
want to thank you for your attention and

118
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,919
I hope you're going to enjoy the next uh

119
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,680
50 minutes or so and I please welcome to

120
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,520
the stage professor Michael Strano who's

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,919
going to give us his talk. Thank you

122
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,919
very much Michael.

123
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:08,400
[Applause]

124
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,800
Thank you very much for that

125
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,720
introduction. I have um it's my my

126
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,759
pleasure to speak to to speak to you on

127
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,600
this on this topic of nano and climate

128
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,680
resilience. I'm a professor in chemical

129
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,919
engineering. I've been here about 17

130
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,160
years and I lead a nanotech technology

131
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,160
laboratory. Um and I'm pleased to be

132
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,639
here. I I thought I would start start

133
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,280
off why why are climate problems why why

134
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,680
can they be solved by nanotechnology? So

135
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,759
na n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n

136
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,160
n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n

137
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,400
nanom materials give us new ways to to

138
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,960
to control catalysis and re reactivity.

139
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,840
So uh many climate problems are really

140
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,320
chemistry pro problems and at the nanome

141
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,720
meter scale we can design new catalysts

142
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,199
that can do transformations that can do

143
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,800
things like re react green greenhouse

144
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,520
gases to to to useful pro properties and

145
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,080
then climate problems also intersect

146
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,400
with energy conservation and how how how

147
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,960
we use energy and nanom materials give

148
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,800
give us new ways to manipulate uh and

149
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,400
control the way energy flows like

150
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
through like through carbon nano tubes

151
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,000
and nanowires

152
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,319
and many climate pro problems involve

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,720
our need to separate and and sort and to

154
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,440
process uh molecules and we have new

155
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,680
ways uh using nanopores that we can

156
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,680
manipulate molecules for for that

157
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,919
purpose. So what I thought I would talk

158
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,319
to to you today about are three projects

159
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,280
from from my my laboratory where we're

160
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,600
applying nano technology solutions to

161
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,280
long-standing climate challenges. The

162
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,199
the first uh addresses uh how how do we

163
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:46,639
valorize or or or make useful um waste

164
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:50,960
methane and ura and you you probably the

165
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:55,120
the the pioneer um who will speak next

166
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:58,400
in this area area has been Desiree Plata

167
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,880
u who's pointed out methane is a very

168
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,840
potent green green h greenhouse gas also

169
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,360
chemistry-wise it's actually notoriously

170
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,800
difficult to react act and so um it's

171
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,240
it's responsible for for.5% of warming

172
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,199
and so we want to do something with

173
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,599
waste methane it's produced um from from

174
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,440
the decay of bio gas and uh there are

175
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,720
many many social sources of waste

176
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,360
methane at the same time we we we have

177
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,720
an industry where we purposely make ura

178
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,039
and we make it from uh ammonia from the

179
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,680
habbash pro process a very

180
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,240
energyintensive process uh but at the

181
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,039
same time actually in waste water. We

182
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,759
have enough ura to actually supply to to

183
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,919
supply the whole the the whole economy.

184
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,479
And so we see this as a a wasted

185
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,280
opportunity. We've been working on

186
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,880
chemical ways to to react methane in in

187
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,720
water with ura. A big breakthrough in in

188
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,360
this space we published just earlier

189
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,919
this year. We made what we call a

190
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,080
synthetic methanotrope. Like what nano

191
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,560
allows us to do is to basically do what

192
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,879
nature can do with bacteria but in the

193
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,160
form of two different nanop particles. A

194
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,720
ZSM5 is an aluminino silicate nano

195
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,160
particle and it'll take methane and

196
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,400
it'll react it to to methanol which now

197
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,960
you you can go and make useful pro

198
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,280
products with uh if you use this enzyme

199
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,680
called al alcohol oxidase which we also

200
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,919
mount on a nanoparticle. Well, this will

201
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,440
actually couple back and will feed the

202
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,279
ZSM5 an oxidizer. And this this kind of

203
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,279
chemical cycle is what you what you

204
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,760
would what you would find in a living

205
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,120
organism, but nanotechnology allows us

206
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,800
to actually uh replicate it in in test

207
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,360
tube and replicate it into a larger

208
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,680
reactor. And so th this this does what

209
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,480
bacteria can can do in water. It can

210
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,800
take methane and it can it can make a

211
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,959
useful intermediate. And what we've been

212
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,160
doing is using this chem chemistry to

213
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,560
capture the ura in wastewater. And this

214
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,680
is opening up a new synthetic pa pathway

215
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,720
where we we we can take waste methane

216
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,680
waste ura and then make a a variety of

217
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,839
renewable materials like adhesives uh

218
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,320
green insulation materials for

219
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,160
sustainable con construction and even

220
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,720
fertilizer. So if you're interested

221
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,560
please please um please learn learn

222
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,720
more. You can go to go to my website and

223
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,080
other re resources. We're very excited

224
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,480
about that. I wanted to uh move on to

225
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,640
the next topic. These are new materials

226
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,240
that we just invented in the in in the

227
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,000
lab and they can solve the problem of of

228
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,519
uh in infrastructure for the hydrogen

229
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,920
economy. So we hydrogen is is the fuel

230
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,600
the growth of hydrogen as a fuel. We

231
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,320
have to make the transition to to it.

232
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,320
It's a perfect fuel. It burns to water.

233
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
uh and it's it's going to be ve very

234
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,839
important for sectors that are difficult

235
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,080
to electrify and so the the uh there's

236
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,720
there's uh substantial growth in the

237
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,200
hydrogen economy that's predicted but

238
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,440
there is a drawback. Um maybe few people

239
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,200
in the room know that you can't just put

240
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,519
hydrogen gas into our our natural gas

241
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,839
infrastructure. It it would be nice

242
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,600
there there there's an insidious

243
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,160
engineering problem that that happens.

244
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,880
It's called hydrogen in brittlement.

245
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,800
Hydrogen is so small as a as a molecule,

246
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,959
it'll actually intercolate even the

247
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,360
strongest steels. And when it does so,

248
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,839
it turns the steel into into basically

249
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,040
fragile glass. And the way you know it

250
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,440
happened is there's there's an

251
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,839
explosion. So this problem really needs

252
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:38,000
to be solved in order to transition to

253
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:40,160
the hydrogen economy. And so we um a few

254
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,800
years ago we invented a completely new

255
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,200
class of material material mater

256
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,600
materials. It's a It's a 2D polymer.

257
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,920
This is called a polyaramid. It's one of

258
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,680
the strongest polymers ever measured. Uh

259
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,600
if you're familiar with Kevlar and a

260
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,200
bulletproof vest, it's a similar

261
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,200
chemistry, but actually we solve the

262
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,440
problem of polymerizing in two

263
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,240
dimensions. And what what we've made is

264
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,399
a very interesting material. It's a it's

265
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,320
a polymer. We would all agree, the the

266
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,200
chemist would agree. But once we

267
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,079
actually spin it into a film, it makes a

268
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,240
very tightly bound, hydrogen-bound film

269
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,680
that starts to look like graphine. It's

270
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,760
a spray-on or paint on strong, durable

271
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,480
graphine. And I think science has never

272
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,600
seen anything like it. It forms these

273
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,680
very tightly bound bound stacks. And

274
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,079
what we found is it's the first

275
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,320
impermeable painton polymer. Actually,

276
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,440
we measure no gas permeability through

277
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,800
it at all. This graph permeability is is

278
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,360
measured in this unit called called

279
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,920
barer. All conventional polymers are are

280
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,920
are up here. This polymer is not even

281
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,600
close. It's orders of magnitude lower.

282
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,240
It's actually at the detection limit.

283
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,640
You really can't detect any further. And

284
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,240
the only other types of materials that s

285
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,120
that that have this property are like

286
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,600
graphine. So basically we have a painton

287
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,320
perfect barrier material. And this graph

288
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,480
highlights how unusual this material is.

289
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,079
It's a polymer, but you paint you paint

290
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,320
it on, it becomes like a perfect crystal

291
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,120
graphine. And so, we're using this to

292
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,680
solve the problem of hydrogen imbr.

293
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,040
Please go to this uh QR code, you can

294
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,480
find out more. We're very excited to

295
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,839
talk to you more about about that. And

296
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,320
then just really quick in the last

297
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,639
minute or so that that I have, we're

298
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,440
also working on technologies that that

299
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,720
that can enable the fourth agricultural

300
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,440
re revolution. and we're we're using uh

301
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,680
pioneering plant nano nanotech

302
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,240
technology. The problem here we're

303
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,399
trying to solve is global food prices

304
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,880
are are rising. They're rising for a

305
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,040
variety of reasons, but but one is that

306
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,000
climates are changing and there's

307
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,720
examples of that all all over. Uh the

308
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,720
the the the palm oil that we get on our

309
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,000
shelves, a lot of it comes from

310
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,440
Malaysia. And if you look at the

311
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,839
rainfall, it's just consistently

312
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,320
falling. the climate is changing and at

313
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,160
some point where we grow things uh we'll

314
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,760
we'll have to find alternatives to how

315
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,600
we grow the foods that we take for

316
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,680
granted. In the meantime prices are

317
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,760
going to rise. So this is definitely a

318
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,760
climate pro problem and it's

319
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,560
contributing to uh global food

320
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,760
insecurity. What uh my colleagues and

321
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,480
and I made a uh an an entity called

322
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,480
called Dist. It's a it's MIT's uh

323
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,680
research enterprise in Singapore through

324
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,320
the smart pro pro program. It gives uh

325
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,519
it gives my myself and also our our

326
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,079
chair Benedetto Morelli

327
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,399
um a a vehicle to work on problems like

328
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,639
this in agriculture. Briefly, what we're

329
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,519
trying to do are make tools that could

330
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,519
close the loop and and be able to to

331
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,399
grow crops. If you think of the input

332
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,880
light, water, CO2 and fertilizer. If you

333
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,200
think of th those as inputs, you could

334
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,040
imagine nanotech technology enabled

335
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,200
tools which give you feedback from the

336
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,000
plant that allow you to do rapid

337
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,360
feedback control and make technology

338
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
where you could essentially grow

339
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,000
anything. And so go here to this uh QR

340
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,880
code and you can find find out more

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,399
about our p our pioneering work. Um I'm

342
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,240
interested in hearing from the other

343
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,680
speakers. So, I'm going to I'm I'm going

344
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,839
to end end there and and I'm happy to

345
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,360
pass it off to the to the next speaker.

346
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,800
Yeah.

347
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,040
I think we're going to take questions at

348
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,040
the end, right?

349
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,720
I'm Desiree Plat. I am a professor in

350
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,399
civil and environmental engineering. And

351
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,079
I don't have a single SEM today, so I'm

352
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,480
going to apologize to Vlad personally,

353
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,399
but but I we have them. I'll show them

354
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,000
after. Um, so I want to start by talking

355
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,600
about sustainable innovation and the

356
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
role that it has in the restorative

357
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,839
economy. The economic systems that we

358
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
have today are depleting to our

359
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,160
resources, inherently polluting, and all

360
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,240
of that is an externality that's not

361
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,199
accommodated in the business model. So,

362
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,199
I'm going to take you to that

363
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,199
macroscopic scale that Benedetto

364
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,519
mentioned and then drive back down to

365
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,839
the to the nano scale. Uh, one thing

366
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,040
that I I want to underscore here for

367
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,800
those of you who aren't aware, the

368
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,680
climate project at MIT has an

369
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,920
articulated mission to change the

370
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,920
trajectory of global climate outcomes

371
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,920
within a decade. And this is what that

372
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,480
trajectory looks like. It looked like

373
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,519
this um five years ago. It looks like

374
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,959
this today. Uh, our global anthropogenic

375
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,000
CO2 emissions are around 51 gigatons

376
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:31,040
annually. Whoops, excuse me. Um, and

377
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,959
implemented policies have some ability

378
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,880
to to tune those total emissions. But in

379
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,720
order to hit any kind of twoderee

380
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,959
warming targets, we have to

381
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,959
fundamentally change the way that we do

382
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,760
things. I have a list of technologies

383
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,160
that I think are musthaves in order to

384
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,519
to meet this goal or bridge this gap. It

385
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,199
includes things that are being worked on

386
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,279
in the climate project like better

387
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,759
adaptation and resilience, smarter

388
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,639
cities, nuclear energy for data centers

389
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,399
and manufacturing, electrification, um

390
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,240
including systems integrated in the

391
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,720
materials that we need for for

392
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,000
electrification. Um industrial heating

393
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,720
or transportable uh liquid fuels um

394
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,639
sustainable agriculture is is enormous

395
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,880
um and and must be addressed. Today I'm

396
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,440
going to focus on biological carbon

397
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,440
removals and the associated bioeconomy

398
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,920
that would need to come along with that

399
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,480
to finance the whole thing. Now in order

400
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,360
to hit that twoderee line, the IPCC

401
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:31,120
estimates that we need 10 gigatons of

402
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,759
CO2 removal by 2050. Now 10 gigatons is

403
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,519
bigger than the coal industry itself.

404
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,680
And that's a rock. So we're talking

405
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,639
about pulling a gas out of the sky, a

406
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,120
dilute uh substrate. That's hard. this

407
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,120
industry had a hundred years to scale or

408
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,920
more. We've got to do this in a couple

409
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,519
of decades. One of the only places on

410
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,440
Earth where we move that amount of

411
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,160
material is actually in the agricultural

412
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,079
sector. So the the wet the excuse me the

413
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,639
dry weight of the agricultural sector se

414
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,880
sector is around 18 gigatons and the

415
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,639
residues or waste associated with that

416
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,679
are on the order of four to seven

417
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,079
gigatons of dry waste. So, we like to

418
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,559
call the agricultural biosphere the

419
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,240
sleeping giant of carbon removals that

420
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,240
hasn't really necessarily gotten the

421
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,720
attention that it deserves. And if you

422
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,959
do this accounting, there's somewhere

423
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,280
approaching 7 gigatons of CO2

424
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,839
equivalents removable available on on

425
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,319
the face of the earth today. Now, about

426
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,240
1.2 of that could be readily used. It's

427
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,880
either directly incinerated back to the

428
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,400
atmosphere or it it's left on the field.

429
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,919
And and you have to leave some of that

430
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,320
carbon on the field. I want to be clear

431
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,240
and fair there uh to to keep the soil

432
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,679
healthy, but you can remove a fraction

433
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,160
of it. And we're estimating that that's

434
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,480
around 1 gigaton of CO2 equivalents.

435
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,960
Food waste amounts to around one gigaton

436
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,640
of of C per year um CO2 equivalent

437
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,200
removal. So if you don't have composting

438
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,360
in your town, get that quickly. Um I

439
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,080
want to walk through why the the

440
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,520
financing of this system becomes really

441
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,000
important. How many people have heard

442
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,679
about direct air capture, right? So

443
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,200
you're pushing air through fans,

444
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,600
removing that 420 parts per million CO2

445
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,000
as it as it comes through. Direct air

446
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,120
capture carbon credits sell for around

447
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,760
900 to $1,200 per ton CO2 equivalent.

448
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,760
Now if we want to hit that 10 billion

449
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,200
metric ton mark, we're going to be

450
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,440
spending half of US GDP to do it right.

451
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,880
It's completely intractable. Not to

452
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,160
mention the fact that um direct air

453
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,200
capture would top out around a gigaton

454
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:36,080
of removal if we made every air handler

455
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,000
we ever made 80 times over. All right.

456
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,760
So let's just do what we did 80 times

457
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,919
again and see how that helps us out.

458
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,880
It's it's not a a great move. Right? So

459
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:48,640
the global GDP is around 100 and $110

460
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,559
trillion. US uh GDP around $25 trillion.

461
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,720
If we start to look at biio-based

462
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:56,559
storage technologies, we think those can

463
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,320
happen around $100 to $150 a ton CO2

464
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,640
removal. The methane emissions reduction

465
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,240
credits are on the order of $25 a ton

466
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,000
CO2 removal. And that's and that's

467
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,160
pretty exciting. And just for reference,

468
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,400
the value of our emissions, so if you

469
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,960
take the total global economy and divide

470
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,039
it by that 51 gigatons of CO2 emissions,

471
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,120
you've only got about $2,000 to play

472
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:19,440
with per ton of CO2 that we emit. So

473
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,840
nanomaterials and specialty chemicals

474
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,840
occupy a unique place in the market. If

475
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,400
we look at the way a barrel of oil is

476
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,559
used today, the m the value that's

477
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
derived from specialty chemicals is on

478
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,840
the order of the value that's derived

479
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,799
from the fuel itself. So if 76% of the

480
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,880
volume of a barrel of oil is going um to

481
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,799
make to products that we actually just

482
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,440
directly burn that generates almost a

483
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:46,000
trillion dollars in equal proportion

484
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,600
financially is the 16% of specialty

485
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,760
chemicals. So there's a lot of revenue

486
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,799
moving around in the specialty chemicals

487
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,280
market. Now how could we possibly take

488
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,280
advantage of a similar system for a

489
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,000
carbohydrate economy that's built on

490
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,320
biioaterials as opposed to prochemical

491
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,960
hydrocarbons? um how would we understand

492
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,640
the complexity of what nature is doing

493
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,799
in a way that we can manipulate that

494
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,720
matter on the nano scale ourselves?

495
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,640
Would we be tolerant to the product

496
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,160
distribution that nature is? Not every

497
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,640
leaf is the same, of course, but it

498
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:21,039
works perfectly well. Um how do we

499
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:23,360
reconcile the need to pace innovation

500
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,840
at a level that allows us to incorporate

501
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,280
environmental objectives into the design

502
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,520
process along with traditional

503
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,960
performance and cost ones? So the

504
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,400
example I'm going to tell you about

505
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,400
today is uh derived from ocean plastic

506
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,480
waste. And what I love about ocean

507
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,720
plastic waste is that it's wonderfully

508
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,039
photogenic as a pollutant. This brought

509
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,559
a lot of attention not only to the

510
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,520
dissolved chemicals that we've been

511
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,080
floating in for since the 1970s and and

512
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,840
50s or sooner. Um but it also brought a

513
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,080
lot of attention to climate change. We

514
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,919
can't grab CO2 in front of us. We can't

515
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,600
take a picture of it and put it on

516
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,120
Instagram. But plastic pollution has

517
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,000
brought an immense amount of attention

518
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,240
to these global scale problems. Now you

519
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,880
what you might not know is that plastic

520
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,360
production in the next 10 to 12 years is

521
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,679
going to outpace the integrated

522
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,919
production since plastics were invented.

523
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,159
So if you think this problem is bad now,

524
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,919
it will double in your lifetime if we

525
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,440
don't change how we're doing things. So

526
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,919
we started to look at those

527
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,240
transformation processes that occur

528
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,679
between the nanoase plastics and the

529
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,760
small particles that are formed and the

530
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,760
dissolved molecules and we can actually

531
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,600
pair those transformations together much

532
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,280
like you would a social network. Who's

533
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,360
friends with who, who's turning into

534
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,679
what and we can zoom in with chemical

535
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,000
molecular specificity. So not only can

536
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,000
we know which molecule is um parent

537
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,320
molecule is becoming which child

538
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,919
molecule, but how that transformation is

539
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,760
occurring. And something that is

540
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,159
important to point out here is one

541
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,919
degradation is is not monotonic. It

542
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,559
doesn't just fall apart. It forms other

543
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,280
things. Um but two that this is an

544
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,159
incredibly data dense network. This is

545
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,559
high throughput experimentation in one

546
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,799
pot. So if we can trace these complex

547
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,799
networks, every one of those nodes is a

548
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,960
molecule. Every one of those edges has a

549
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,280
reaction rate associated with it. This

550
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,200
is how we generate big data. This is how

551
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,559
I get molecules to carry cell phones in

552
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,840
their pocket and tell me everything they

553
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,000
ever bought and where they've been that

554
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,320
day. Um, so I'm pretty excited about

555
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
that. We've applied this technology to

556
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,480
several different industrial common

557
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,799
industrial chemicals, um, polymers here,

558
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,039
polyamid 6, polycaperactone, which is in

559
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,679
your medical implants, and polyactic

560
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,679
acid, the greenware. Um I won't get into

561
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,240
the details of this but functionally we

562
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,720
can start to ask the question if we just

563
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,000
mathematically multiply n there the

564
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,400
number of units that we're adding

565
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,960
together and ask what's left over we can

566
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,120
start to identify related groups of

567
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,679
molecules so subsets of molecules that

568
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,440
are all interrelated and as we grow

569
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,360
those molecules their retention time

570
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,360
changes on this instrument in a very

571
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,880
logical way that actually tells us how

572
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,880
it will behave in an environmental

573
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,880
system. Will it stick to a particle?

574
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,280
will it go into your cell um and what

575
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,720
have you and and we can also know

576
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,960
something about the chemical structure

577
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,919
based on how it behaves in response to

578
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,840
changes in pH. Now we can take that and

579
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,400
extend it to systems in the natural

580
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,600
world including biomolelecules that are

581
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,760
present um in in the ocean. Uh it so we

582
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,960
could we in this particular example we

583
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,440
suspended a complex polymer enriched

584
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,440
bacteria that were able to colonize that

585
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,400
polymer and started to systematically

586
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,120
study which bacteria and what proteins

587
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,799
in their in their um genetic makeup were

588
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,039
able to perform which chemical

589
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,280
transformations. Now this is a different

590
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:43,039
experimental set but functionally what

591
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,880
we can now try to do is step through the

592
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,880
biological molecules which are all

593
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,039
linked through that intellectual

594
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,919
exercise that we do in the data. Those

595
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,080
are the red symbols and the biomolecules

596
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,159
the gray ones. So we know who's turning

597
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,159
into what. We know what came from an

598
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,919
industrial material or maybe that's your

599
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,000
desired product in this case and what

600
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,960
came from the biological exodates

601
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,880
themselves. Now, if we were going to

602
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,120
really start to understand how nature

603
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,520
was performing bio transformations in

604
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,440
these complex mixtures, we would have to

605
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,360
amass a lot more data than what I'm

606
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,679
showing you here. So, high throughput

607
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,000
experimentation is truly necessary.

608
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,240
Those complex molecular networks exist

609
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,840
in every one of the examples here um

610
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,440
that I'll tell you about. So, Professor

611
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,400
Brad Olsen's group in chemical

612
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,960
engineering has ma synthetically uh made

613
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,039
se over 700 different polymers. I think

614
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,760
this is the world's largest uh synthetic

615
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,679
heteropolymer library. We subject th

616
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,679
those to high throughput degradation

617
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,520
testing along with high throughput

618
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,760
material performance testing. Right?

619
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,760
Nobody likes a paper straw. We want

620
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,919
these materials to be good at their at

621
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,159
their primary job in addition to being

622
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,840
compatible with the environment. And

623
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,760
then we can use that chemical

624
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,120
transformations data on mass to

625
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,440
understand what gives rise to

626
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,000
biodegradation and how can we manipulate

627
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,120
it using the tools of biology. This is

628
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,720
just some smiles code or big smiles as

629
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,400
we call it in polymers. It's a line

630
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,840
entry system. So your computer can

631
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,840
understand what the molecular structure

632
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,520
is. Um and we can start to understand

633
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,440
how chemical structure imparts a

634
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,080
particular reactivity or desired

635
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,240
biological output. This is available um

636
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,480
to you in encrypt app which is just

637
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,159
publicly launched. So it's all that cool

638
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,840
materials performance data, the

639
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,840
biodegradation data along with

640
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,600
performance and cost metrics to really

641
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,000
start to change the way we design

642
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,120
materials and processes so that they are

643
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,679
implicitly more compatible and with the

644
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,919
way the earth system works. So I'll end

645
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,840
by saying that nature's uh works

646
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,919
symbiotically and restoratively. The

647
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,480
materials and energy fluxes are are

648
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,799
locally balanced. Our economic systems

649
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,320
haven't done that very well. Prosperous

650
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,720
nations tend to emit 20 tons uh of

651
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,760
carbon CO2 equivalents per person per

652
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,039
year whereas um transitioning nations

653
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,679
emit 10 times less. The only way you

654
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,480
move between these lines is either with

655
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,880
substantive investment in a decarbonized

656
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,760
grid or renewable energy or through

657
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:13,039
geopolitical restructuring events like

658
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:16,159
war. The goal here is to use sustainable

659
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,400
design to move us down these lines and

660
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,559
not enormous global conflict. And that's

661
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,200
really what's at stake here. This is an

662
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,840
all of MIT effort uh in order to

663
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,000
transition the global economy. Now,

664
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,880
that's improbable, but it's not

665
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,360
impossible. So, I'd like to end with a

666
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,520
little homage to to the improbability

667
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,640
walk behind MIT Nano. This was the

668
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,799
brainchild of Vlad um as uh as to honor

669
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,799
Millie Drestle House, the queen of of

670
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,640
nanocarbon. And Millie used to say that

671
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,159
her path from being the daughter of a

672
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,400
Polish immigrant to an institute

673
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,480
professor at MIT was was highly

674
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,559
improbable, but importantly not

675
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,380
impossible. The same is true for this

676
00:26:52,559 --> 00:27:02,999
challenge.

677
00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:02,999
[Applause]

678
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,320
Wait as it comes on.

679
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,840
Okay. Okay. Can you guys hear me? All

680
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,960
right. Thank you. Uh, thanks for having

681
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:37,240
me, Vladimir and Benedto. Um, so I'm

682
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,240
going to talk about Huh.

683
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,520
I'm going to talk about uh uh uh what we

684
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,240
are doing in my lab. uh we work on

685
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,720
advanced materials and interfaces and

686
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,640
interestingly they go across climate to

687
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,320
health and in fact a lot of the climate

688
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,760
problems impact health and I'll

689
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,279
highlight two things we are doing on

690
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:02,880
carbon capture and on uh uh and on in

691
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:06,640
agriculture today um uh so as you've

692
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,279
already heard um uh the uh the carbon

693
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,000
problem is a gig scale problem uh and

694
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:14,240
for us to be able to remove uh so many

695
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
giga tons of CO2 we have been we need to

696
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,200
be thinking about scale from the get-

697
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,919
go. And as was highlighted before, there

698
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,799
are many scales here. And um we need to

699
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,720
go to macro scales, but using really

700
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,559
nanocale uh effects because surface to

701
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,720
volume ratio plays a very very important

702
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,360
role. And if you look at the whole

703
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,960
carbon problem, it's really a capex opex

704
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,679
problem. And how do we kind of solve

705
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,120
this capex opex problem has been at the

706
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,440
heart of a lot of the things that uh

707
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,520
we've been working on. And then if you

708
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,240
go to renewables, you need storage

709
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,960
otherwise uh it's it's hard to uh

710
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,240
transition. And um uh while I'm not

711
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,399
going to cover this today, but we've

712
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,320
been working on non-lethium,

713
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,760
nonflammable batteries. It's been

714
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,840
commercialized with a company where I

715
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,480
co-founded called Alim Energy and um u

716
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,000
and we hope to put things out into

717
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,080
market in maybe 2027. uh but it's really

718
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,640
kind of closing these loops uh will help

719
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,279
us to do the energy transition. So let

720
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,120
me kind of jump into the CO2 capture and

721
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,480
conversion and thinking about this at

722
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,480
scale uh from the get-go. And uh we've

723
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,039
been looking at different sources of CO2

724
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,279
whether it's point source all the way to

725
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,159
uh dock and DAC. So these are oceans

726
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:33,600
where you have CO2 concentrations that

727
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,279
are 100 times more than in air. So it's

728
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,960
more concentrated so you can process

729
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,720
less volumes. um you know shockingly the

730
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,960
same concentration as you would see in

731
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,720
the exhaust of a gas turbine. So uh

732
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,039
ocean acidification effects are already

733
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,880
having a big impact right here you know

734
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,039
next to us in Maine. So I'll talk uh

735
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,799
talk a little bit about that and then

736
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,640
how do you capture and then valorize

737
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,880
that CO2 so that you can make something

738
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,799
that's economically feasible. So if you

739
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,279
look at our conventional sort of ways to

740
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:04,399
do capture and conversion, you're going

741
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,720
um the capture step uh is you know uh if

742
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:10,480
I draw here the there are no numbers

743
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:14,880
here but it's cost versus uh cost versus

744
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,960
energetics. The um the cost to capture

745
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,919
is the capture is driven mostly by

746
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,679
kinetics. So it's a capex problem and

747
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,520
then you need to extract and then you

748
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,640
need to do something with it and you now

749
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,320
start to add uh a lot of energetics. But

750
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,159
if you're able to actually go and

751
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,080
integrate a number of these components

752
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,240
for example instead of doing extraction

753
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,320
you do direct conversion then you can

754
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,320
have a lot of savings and those are the

755
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,960
kind of system level architectures that

756
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,880
we are also been implementing. So an

757
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,760
example I like to start off with is the

758
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:49,039
Petronova plant. If some of you have uh

759
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,679
known or seen these, this is a u it took

760
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:56,159
500 where where is this going? Yeah,

761
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:58,080
it's a $500 million capex uh plant uh

762
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,039
and it's about the size of this

763
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,640
credential tower uses amines to capture

764
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:06,799
CO2 and where the solubility of CO2 is

765
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,799
pretty high. But so one of the questions

766
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,760
I had was why do you need such large

767
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:14,880
towers and we started looking at uh some

768
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,480
of these uh things to to to optimize

769
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,039
this and actually this went out of

770
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,039
business when uh oil markets crashed

771
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,320
because the CO2 was used for enhanced

772
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:26,080
oil recovery here. Um so if you uh kind

773
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,360
of look at this these are all packed bed

774
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,200
kind of reactors and um uh the

775
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,720
absorption rate is controlled by film

776
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,600
thickness which is on the order of

777
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,360
hundreds of microns. So the thought was

778
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,519
okay how do I increase surface area? I

779
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,840
could go to finer and finer drops and

780
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,080
create finer and finer mists and you can

781
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,279
now significantly increase sort of that

782
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,279
surface to volume ratio and go to large

783
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,720
capture and significantly reduce the

784
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,799
capex and cost etc. The question is okay

785
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,039
you know why didn't anyone do this

786
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,039
because you missed get entrained and you

787
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:01,360
can go out if you look out there you

788
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:03,200
know you can see a bunch of that plumes

789
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,440
coming out of cooling towers there you

790
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,799
can see a plume right there so we have

791
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,960
solved this problem before where we um

792
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,360
where we have invented a technology

793
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,440
where we sort of inject these plumes

794
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,919
with electrical charge and we when you

795
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,039
switch on we can sort of capture that

796
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,159
and this has actually been

797
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,760
commercialized now uh with a uh where

798
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,679
I've taken this out through a company

799
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,360
called infinite cooling and we

800
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,120
demonstrated this at scale actually at

801
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,480
MIT uh power plant here. So um so if you

802
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,799
take something like that and we're

803
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,919
combining that with our carbon capture

804
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:41,200
mists we can significantly reduce capex

805
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,200
costs uh and then bring this down and uh

806
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,279
we've actually proven this out for

807
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,080
cooling towers and we can bring this to

808
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,320
bear to uh to to some of these

809
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,039
absorption towers. So this is actually a

810
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,240
a prototype that went from lab the one

811
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,440
that I just showed you which was a

812
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,600
coffee strainer to uh to the MIT cooling

813
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,360
tower all the way to now industrial

814
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,320
cooling towers and now being deployed at

815
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:07,120
EDF uh where uh we've now modularized

816
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,000
this uh to do uh industrial cooling

817
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,519
tower capture but then we are uh using

818
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,600
these technologies and putting them

819
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,600
together to really think about

820
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,720
absorption towers in a totally different

821
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,720
uh way and kind of scale uh make them

822
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,240
more efficient and reduce the capex

823
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,200
costs.

824
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,200
The other uh another interesting uh

825
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,279
challenge that came up was in in all of

826
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,200
these capture systems, you have some

827
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,600
sort of an absorber, right? Like the

828
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,760
hydroxide solutions that I showed you.

829
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,760
Uh and then you need to then release the

830
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,240
CO2 or do conversion of that CO2. And

831
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,799
these are both at odds with each other.

832
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,240
And that's because what happens is the

833
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:48,320
absorption here u and the conversion

834
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,720
leads to when you want to do absorption

835
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,919
you need hydroxide concent hydroxides to

836
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,440
be there and when you are doing

837
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,600
conversion you want everything to go

838
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,600
into a carbonate and what happens is you

839
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,840
end up somewhere in the in in between

840
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,240
and so the higher the carbonate loading

841
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,120
the worse the absorption is and then or

842
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,960
the higher the hydroxide when you come

843
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,800
into the conversion part you're

844
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,800
essentially protonating this so you

845
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,800
create water so who want to make sure

846
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,560
that you get complete conversion but

847
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,240
most of the times you're not you're you

848
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,720
know sort of in this 50/50 kind of

849
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,480
range. So one of the things we did was

850
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,320
how do you solve this constraint? You

851
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,399
know you're in the absorption you're in

852
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,399
this corner. Ideally you want to be here

853
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,240
when you're doing conversion but you end

854
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:31,200
up sort of being here or in that

855
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,359
extreme. So you want to kind of uh

856
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,079
create some black box here that's going

857
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:39,200
to decouple these two systems. And uh

858
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,639
what we did was so that you can then uh

859
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,480
have something that do does the

860
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,599
absorption and then something that does

861
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,960
a conversion. So the way we did this was

862
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,960
using um you know nanopiltration where

863
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,079
you can now separate the carbonate and

864
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,920
the hydroxide ions in a way that uh you

865
00:34:54,079 --> 00:35:00,400
can now create a system that uh uh feeds

866
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,800
that basically uses uh the hydroxides

867
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,920
here for the capture and the conversion

868
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,520
is uh purely u on the carbonate uh

869
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,240
solutions

870
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,560
and uh you know this uh was extremely

871
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,040
effective. uh we've gotten a significant

872
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,800
boost in the uh cost reduction but also

873
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,359
operational stability and operational

874
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,560
window for both the capture and release

875
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,800
uh kind of steps. So my kind of goal is

876
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,760
putting all these together uh we have

877
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,960
had few other uh nice inventions here on

878
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,599
uh looking at um conversion and scaling

879
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,160
conversion using hierarchical uh gas

880
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,040
diffusion electrodes. And so I start

881
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,680
with my source uh do this sort of a

882
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,160
capture and then using uh some of the

883
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,480
electrochemical reduction steps that

884
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,040
where we've shown uh using these

885
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,040
hierarchical conductors to scale we can

886
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,320
actually then regenerate our sorbent and

887
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,200
bring it back and so this kind of

888
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,200
overall cycle uh could really uh

889
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,119
increase the both reduce both capex and

890
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,359
opex and increase the operational

891
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,440
stability of these kind of systems. So

892
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,720
I'll quickly step to another side of the

893
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,880
story which is um which is uh oceans

894
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,880
right so a lot of about 30% of our

895
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,320
emissions partition into the oceans

896
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,720
leading to increased ocean acidification

897
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,560
and um uh but the interesting thing is

898
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,599
the oceans are the biggest contacttor

899
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,480
there is and you have about um you know

900
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,440
100 times more CO2 in ocean uh captured

901
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,200
than uh in air and therefore uh the

902
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,680
capture step is kind of already done for

903
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,800
you. So what we have done here is using

904
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,800
a process where we electrochemically uh

905
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,880
do convert the bicarbonate into

906
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,119
molecular CO2 where it could be stripped

907
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,200
off and then regenerated here where we

908
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,359
deeprotonate and can release alkalized

909
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,440
water. Uh we've been able to get this

910
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,720
with the some of the lowest energetics

911
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,440
per ton of CO2 uh no membranes and we

912
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,240
could create these nice um uh nice

913
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,240
effective alkalized ocean streams.

914
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,240
>> Yeah.

915
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,800
I'm sorry.

916
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,560
>> What? What?

917
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,720
>> Yeah.

918
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,560
>> Sure.

919
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,720
Okay. So uh so what we are doing is we

920
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,280
are trying to extract that CO2 out of

921
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,839
these uh out of the oceans and these

922
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:33,440
could be deployed in um you know in

923
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,680
offshore systems or in um or uh you know

924
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,920
with shipping and others and one uh

925
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,640
interesting application for us here is

926
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,800
in aquaculture where uh ocean

927
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,040
acidification effects have really sort

928
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,839
of diminished the carbonate that's that

929
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,280
is needed to actually form for shellfish

930
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:53,599
to form shells and is a uh interesting

931
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,119
market where the specific value of the

932
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,119
CO2 removal is quite high and um in fact

933
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,920
there's been a loss of productivity in

934
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,480
uh Washington oyster uh kind of market

935
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,800
as well as in U of Maine where ocean

936
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,920
waters are artificially buffered today.

937
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,079
So uh we are using this as a as a uh

938
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,640
opportunity for us to show that you can

939
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:18,720
actually do this capture and act and

940
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:21,280
have impact on um uh on coastline

941
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,920
communities as well as local economies

942
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,280
and uh and create a local economic case

943
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,480
for this uh for this uh problem. So uh

944
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,480
the way this is done is we are

945
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,480
partnering with UF main and this is

946
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,440
aragonite super saturation as a function

947
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,160
of pH. So there is a window where we can

948
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,320
optimize these waters today actually

949
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,800
they actually buffer the ocean water

950
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,079
artificially to be able to grow these

951
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,320
shellfish. So uh we are we are scaling

952
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,520
up our technology and what we have done

953
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,599
here is already shown with U of Main

954
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,359
that we can actually apply our buffered

955
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,680
waters. So we are electrochemically

956
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,760
removing the CO2 and taking these

957
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,160
alkalized streams that we're creating

958
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,920
and is already uh uh we've been we

959
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,000
demonstrated that we can instead of

960
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,920
artificially buffering we could sort of

961
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,920
do it this way and this is some some

962
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,640
recent experiments with scallops and and

963
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,200
other things. Um and how much time I

964
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,240
have I have in the last few minutes I'll

965
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,560
talk about some of the work we're doing

966
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,320
in agriculture. uh in agriculture you

967
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,960
know there's a lot of uh agrochemicals

968
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,760
that are sprayed for crop protection and

969
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,760
um this is a big challenge because

970
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,520
farmers are sort of you know some of the

971
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,119
most entrepreneurial people I've met

972
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,079
they want to try everything to make

973
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,480
things work uh and one of the issues is

974
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,000
crop protection is so important uh

975
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,520
otherwise you know you have significant

976
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,160
yield losses and so on and uh um you

977
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,599
know this is uh uh amount of pesticides

978
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,839
that are that are sprayed per year um

979
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,079
you know over a billion drops are

980
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:55,200
sprayed in an acre but we don't know

981
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,920
where all these drops are going. Uh we

982
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,240
uh and so spraying is kind of blind and

983
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,839
we you know we spray and pray that

984
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,680
things happen and your crops are

985
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,920
protected. So as a result there's a lot

986
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,320
of overspraying and one of the issues is

987
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,640
actually a lot of uh leaves tend to be

988
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,880
mildly or mostly hydrophobic and you end

989
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,960
up with lot of drops actually coming off

990
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,280
and leading to uh significant

991
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,640
agricultural runoff. And here what you

992
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,119
see is um a result of that leading to uh

993
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,160
contamination drift um you know ending

994
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,839
up in air in our soils uh and also at

995
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,960
the same time this is a huge market

996
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:34,400
right so uh we've kind of tried to

997
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,480
understand why this is the case and uh

998
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,960
this is looking at dynamics of drops

999
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,280
impinging these kind of surfaces and how

1000
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,280
can you get them to stick better so you

1001
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,359
can significantly cut this uh down

1002
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,760
because if inefficiency is happening

1003
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,400
because drops are bouncing off of

1004
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,040
surfaces though they add aduants or

1005
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,640
surfactants to these things and the and

1006
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,400
the important thing is it's in this

1007
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,480
contact time. So the time it takes for

1008
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,200
surfactants to diffuse to the interface

1009
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,760
is way larger than the uh impact time

1010
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,280
scales. So uh long story short is we

1011
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,480
came up with many different techniques

1012
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,680
and one of them here was uh using uh you

1013
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,560
know very thin nanoscopic cloaks that uh

1014
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,599
can be then deployed onto these droplets

1015
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,680
that allow immediate uh arrest and

1016
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,920
striction. And these are all essentially

1017
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,560
plant derived oils and we have uh other

1018
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,880
things that we can use and what we have

1019
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,560
seen is a significant reduction in the

1020
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,800
amount of pesticide use uh and um uh and

1021
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,720
so on. So we went to the farms we tried

1022
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,319
it tried this out to take this out and

1023
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,160
we actually formed a company called Axen

1024
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:40,000
to commercialize this. When we went to

1025
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,680
the farms you know farmers have to deal

1026
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,880
with so many things. This is a boom

1027
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,200
sprayer. There is all kinds of uh you

1028
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,560
know parameters spray height you know

1029
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,720
droplet size uh etc etc that these

1030
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,599
people have to keep track of as this is

1031
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,319
happening. So the farmers had asked okay

1032
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,839
this is all great we want to use it how

1033
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:01,599
what do I know about my current

1034
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,200
coverage? how much of coverage am I

1035
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,599
getting because they all know coverage

1036
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,240
is a king in terms of crop protection

1037
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,240
and uh so no one has measured this no

1038
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,880
one knows where these drops are going so

1039
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,720
we actually came up with a an approach

1040
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:20,079
where uh we have a uh we we devised a

1041
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:24,079
tool uh which is I know can can someone

1042
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,920
click that u can you click the top thing

1043
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,000
so we devised a tool where you can do a

1044
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,240
bolt-on retrofit and actually in line

1045
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,920
when the farmer is spraying we can find

1046
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,280
out where these drops are landing, how

1047
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,800
many drops are there, and how much

1048
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,880
coverage they're getting. So, if they're

1049
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,400
getting too fast, you can see that their

1050
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,319
coverage is obviously dropping, if

1051
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,800
they're going too slow, and they can

1052
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,560
actually change uh what they what

1053
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,160
chemicals they're using. And we have a

1054
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,280
kind of a heat map of where they're

1055
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,599
doing sprays better and not. And the the

1056
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,520
amazing thing here is to give you a

1057
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,000
billion dollars back to farming in a

1058
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,560
year, all you need to do is 6% savings

1059
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,640
in these agrochemicals. And today we

1060
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,800
have shown that this is deployed now in

1061
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,800
a million acres and we have shown that

1062
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,240
we can do 30 to 50% savings. So uh we

1063
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,720
are hoping that this will fundamentally

1064
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,880
change spraying and can really deliver

1065
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,000
value to uh to the customer uh to the to

1066
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:19,000
the farmer. Um that's that's all I have.

1067
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Thanks.

1068
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:26,880
[Applause]

1069
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,640
I would like now to invite the speakers

1070
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,720
to come to the podium so that we can

1071
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,480
have the panel discussion at the end. So

1072
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,040
first of all, thank you very much to

1073
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:38,240
Kria, Desire and Michael for their great

1074
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,480
talks. I think they were extremely

1075
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,240
uh instructive and we all learn a lot.

1076
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,000
I' I've been told that every time you go

1077
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,760
to a talk at MIT, you need to learn

1078
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,040
something

1079
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,960
and I feel like I learned so much.

1080
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,640
So um you clearly showed us different

1081
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,400
type of innovation when it comes to

1082
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,880
having impact on climate at different

1083
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,359
level right starting from the very basic

1084
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,280
science and how to design new materials

1085
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,640
to uh valorize waste up to having a

1086
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,760
system level approach where you're

1087
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,920
really thinking of how to uh modify

1088
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,440
industries that are well entrenched in

1089
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,119
our life and how we can design new

1090
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,160
materials to be able to solve them and

1091
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,240
how to retrofit environmental princ

1092
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,319
principles in the design of our

1093
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,280
innovation. And then of course with KIPA

1094
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:27,040
we saw a technology among the others

1095
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,000
technologies that start from the lab and

1096
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,359
then they go out and have impact uh in

1097
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,880
in the in the real life and in the

1098
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,200
environment.

1099
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,880
And so the first question uh that I have

1100
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,960
to you that I would like to ask you is

1101
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,720
when you when you at the end of the day

1102
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,960
for us always starts with a student or a

1103
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,079
postoc in a lab right and an idea that

1104
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:52,000
has to be developed. So when you think

1105
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:54,079
about solving a problem for climate, how

1106
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,839
do you pick the technology? Like you

1107
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,720
start from the solution that you find in

1108
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:01,119
the lab and then you go from the problem

1109
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,680
or you try to do vice versa or you

1110
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,680
integrate both

1111
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,880
>> me first. Uh

1112
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:13,280
I think both approaches uh we're at an

1113
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,240
institute of technology and so I think

1114
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,119
you can do both both approaches. I think

1115
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,960
um we're we're constantly looking in out

1116
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,280
for for solutions and then I learned

1117
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,359
from my colleagues uh more more depth

1118
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,240
about these problems. You have to do a

1119
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:31,359
lot of homework to really understand the

1120
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:34,319
uh climate challenges problems the the

1121
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:36,640
scale I learned I learned a lot actually

1122
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,240
even just from listening to to my co to

1123
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,599
my colleagues here. So I hope so I'm

1124
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,920
gonna punt I'm gonna say both you do

1125
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,800
both.

1126
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:48,319
>> Any other input? Yeah, I I think that um

1127
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,560
for me lately at least I you know I

1128
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,560
started out in in my career as a as a

1129
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,200
geochemist and oceanographer really

1130
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,440
tracking molecules and worrying very

1131
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:00,400
much about what the impact of that would

1132
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,160
ultimately be. Um and so lately my

1133
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,800
approach is definitely to kind of look

1134
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,200
at global scale materials fluxes and say

1135
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,599
what can somebody studying nanocale

1136
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,240
processes really start to contribute in

1137
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:15,680
this space and a way that it it ends up

1138
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,280
impacting that that largecale operation

1139
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,599
and then thinking about how you actually

1140
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,599
get that from the lab out into the

1141
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,599
economy. But um the students are are

1142
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,800
definitely a primary area of focus. What

1143
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,119
are they going to like? What is their

1144
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,240
ambition? Uh what are their interests?

1145
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,880
um because you always want to make sure

1146
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,599
that's well aligned.

1147
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,319
>> I'll just add to this that um I think

1148
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,119
the the key point for me is you know

1149
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,960
ultimately to have that impact uh what's

1150
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,680
sort of the business case here and what

1151
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,880
is the what is what how how do things

1152
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:49,040
scale right and as a result sometimes

1153
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,920
you may have a great idea which can work

1154
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,000
in a small you know coupon sample that

1155
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,200
may not scale because of various

1156
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,560
constraints. So what are those

1157
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,560
constraints? How do you then

1158
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,560
debottleneck them? Is it a technology

1159
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,560
issue or is it a supply chain issue or

1160
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,359
what is it? And then once you know that

1161
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:08,000
then you can create a really great uh

1162
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:10,960
great project to to address those. So

1163
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,359
it's the quest for you know how do

1164
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,680
things get deployed and then what is the

1165
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,720
science that one needs to do to to get

1166
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,520
there.

1167
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,160
>> Awesome. And then when it comes to take

1168
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,560
a technology and try to transition out

1169
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:28,560
of the lab, what is really required is

1170
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:32,720
to have an ecosystem that help you um

1171
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:34,480
and supports the PI in uh managing IP,

1172
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,800
managing the conflict of interest,

1173
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,560
managing innovation, managing the

1174
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:43,040
policies, uh getting the funds. Um and

1175
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:46,319
so I think that to some extent the the

1176
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:49,280
MIT nano is a good community to start

1177
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,880
thinking about um not only the

1178
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,240
preparation, the synthesis and the

1179
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,319
preparation, the characterization of the

1180
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,119
materials, but also to build a community

1181
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:59,680
within MIT that allows us to think

1182
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,680
carefully and critically how to spin out

1183
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,319
the technology. At the same time though,

1184
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,960
the three of you from your talks have

1185
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:09,760
interacted with either governments or

1186
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,400
with with venture capitalist with the

1187
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:14,960
startup environments and and so you may

1188
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,920
have experienced challenging challenges

1189
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,440
in taking a technology working with

1190
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:24,400
governments and working with um uh with

1191
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,319
with the ecosystem to try to take it out

1192
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,599
of the lab and so what are your

1193
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:31,359
experiences and how do you think it I

1194
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,040
don't think there's a there's a major

1195
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,559
recipe for success particularly in

1196
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,640
climate tech but what do you think are

1197
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,240
the challenges that you that you

1198
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,839
experience and how you think a solution

1199
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,440
can be find to some of the challenges

1200
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,160
>> this is a tough question I know so I

1201
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,760
want to give you some

1202
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:52,400
>> it's the perfect question for the two of

1203
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:55,359
you actually it's a tough tough question

1204
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:58,000
>> I could start if it's you

1205
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:59,520
maybe kipa has many more startups than I

1206
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,079
do I only have been through this twice

1207
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:08,960
advice. Um but I think there are a few

1208
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:13,760
uh you know failures in the way that the

1209
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:18,000
academic to startup path is um ironed.

1210
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:20,640
MIT is by far uh in a way the best at it

1211
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,599
and I've seen other models. We we try to

1212
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:28,079
remove as many barriers as possible and

1213
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:30,720
yet they still exist. And a few that I I

1214
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,440
guess I would highlight would be um the

1215
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,319
mismatch of of time scale and

1216
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:39,359
expectation in tough tech particularly.

1217
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:41,200
So climate technologies um are hard,

1218
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:44,480
right? We're not talking about using

1219
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:47,440
software to program an app um to sell

1220
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,760
dating or love or food services online

1221
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,319
like we know those will sell themselves.

1222
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:54,400
We're talking about really thin margin

1223
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:56,880
industries that the whole world relies

1224
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,800
on that are the basis of our economy and

1225
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,440
then we have to make the technology work

1226
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,920
on top of that which is often very

1227
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,040
difficult um as you know this 18 order

1228
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,119
of magnitude scaling is is no small feat

1229
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:12,160
uh literally and figuratively and so

1230
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:15,520
that I think um traditional venture

1231
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:18,960
capitalists catalytic investors um

1232
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:22,160
financial strategist strategic investors

1233
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,800
are are are typically not um really

1234
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,720
aware of the time scale and that can

1235
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,720
lead to perceived failures that actually

1236
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,480
criticize the entire industry or the

1237
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,400
entire idea. So I'll I'll use algo

1238
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,119
bofuel maybe as an example. There are

1239
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,480
many um so I think that the time scale

1240
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,720
adjustment is really critically

1241
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,880
important. Um nth cycle is a technology

1242
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,280
that uh came out of the carbon

1243
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,079
nanocience that I did here at MIT as a

1244
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,920
as a graduate student. It's now um com

1245
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,240
we opened the first domestic cobalt and

1246
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,880
nickel supply facility this year in

1247
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,720
Ohio. Um that was an incredibly proud

1248
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,000
moment. It's still incredibly

1249
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:00,079
challenging to to have the struggle of

1250
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,720
working with mining companies versus

1251
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:05,119
battery companies versus um different

1252
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,800
types of of investors and and managing

1253
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:09,440
all of those expectations and the

1254
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,960
timelines um and and they're just not uh

1255
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,800
harmonized and that's really what

1256
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,400
creates the lag and it's a luxury we

1257
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,880
don't have. I think the second thing

1258
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,280
that's a real challenge is um managing

1259
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,760
conflict of interest. I'm kind of

1260
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,839
naively, you know, optimistic that we're

1261
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,319
all in this for the right reasons and we

1262
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:28,880
want to see our technologies have the

1263
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:30,319
impact on the world. Um not everybody is

1264
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,559
like that, right? So we have to have

1265
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,839
conflict of interest rules. Of course,

1266
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:35,599
some of them are structured in a way

1267
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,960
that once you spin out a company, you're

1268
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,040
no longer allowed to work on that

1269
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,280
technology. That doesn't make a lot of

1270
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:43,599
sense um to take somebody who spent a

1271
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,520
decade or their entire life thinking

1272
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:47,040
about a problem really deeply and say

1273
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,119
and now you're no longer allowed to work

1274
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,200
on that in this capacity. You know, we

1275
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,839
bring a lot to the table as professors.

1276
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,480
We're able to mobilize, you know, uh

1277
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:58,000
scores of of individuals, sometimes many

1278
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,400
more than that and often many more than

1279
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,480
that. Um we shouldn't be eliminated from

1280
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,200
doing that because we had an idea that

1281
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,920
we wanted to see be not just the paper

1282
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:11,920
but actually the product.

1283
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:14,559
Oh great those are good points

1284
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:18,640
just to add to what the said uh I think

1285
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:20,720
in my journey I found um

1286
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,119
so first step was uh knowing your

1287
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,599
customer what is where are you going and

1288
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:28,160
most of the times you may start with ah

1289
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:31,200
that's my problem I'm solving and you

1290
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:33,359
find yourself at a point where maybe

1291
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,720
that's not what is needed and you have

1292
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:39,200
to then pivot or adjust and or you you

1293
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,680
uh for example on the topic that I just

1294
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,920
showed you, we had a solution for

1295
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,400
reducing agricultural sprays, but then

1296
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,640
the farmer wanted to know how much is

1297
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:51,359
actually on their leaves. So if we

1298
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,119
didn't listen to that, we wouldn't be we

1299
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,960
wouldn't be in a place where we are

1300
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,559
today because knowing that and taking

1301
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,400
that as an opportunity, we came up with

1302
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,800
a tool that tells them now how

1303
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,559
inefficient they are and then we can,

1304
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,400
you know, come up with ways to then

1305
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:07,280
deploy what we have what we what we have

1306
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,880
invented. And the other thing that also

1307
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,640
also uh becomes useful is um you know

1308
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,400
when I did my first startup I had a

1309
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,880
proof of product which was a ketchup

1310
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,280
bottle and people said oh this is great

1311
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,599
uh I can see how this could be used and

1312
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,920
then we went to the next and then you

1313
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,440
know we had to scale from there well it

1314
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,680
worked there and we we showed how we

1315
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,440
could do it but scaling to making

1316
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,200
hundreds of bottles per minute I did not

1317
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:35,200
even think of that. So it's huge

1318
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:37,520
manufacturing challenges uh there. So

1319
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,119
the next thing next company I did we

1320
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,119
started thinking about scale from the

1321
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:44,640
get-go right doing that along with the

1322
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:47,119
science and then you can see we then you

1323
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,280
deploy it we deployed it here and what

1324
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:51,680
that does is as you keep doing that you

1325
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,480
can reduce the risk for investors and

1326
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:58,079
these are all very capital intensive uh

1327
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:00,559
markets. So how can you um how can you

1328
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:03,119
get there fast and how can you reduce

1329
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,960
the overall capex and opex as you go

1330
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,200
through this journey has been an

1331
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:09,280
important learning and as you said the

1332
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,680
capital availability is not you know

1333
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,920
infinite right so everyone has their own

1334
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,599
liquidity timelines and so on so you

1335
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,000
need to have a return on investment so

1336
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:20,160
how quickly could you start making money

1337
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,079
on on the things is is very very

1338
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:24,160
important you can't just say okay I'm

1339
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,920
going to do this for another 10 years in

1340
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,839
a startup because then the startup won't

1341
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,640
exist or the markets would have changed

1342
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:32,319
or rules would have changed. Uh and so

1343
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,960
keeping all that in mind and quickly

1344
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:37,520
getting to revenue is is key to making

1345
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,359
this happen.

1346
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,119
And a question that I have uh for

1347
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,040
Michael and if somebody wants to submit

1348
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,880
questions you can always use the QR code

1349
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,359
over there in case but although we are

1350
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:50,800
running out of time but you Michael have

1351
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:54,160
worked on carbon nanot tubes for um um

1352
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:56,640
since I I I follow your research

1353
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,800
and I think the the trajectory that I

1354
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,559
saw for for the use of carbon nanot

1355
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,079
tubes which are have been extremely

1356
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:04,720
powerful like as a as an example of

1357
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,559
nanotechnology has been that many people

1358
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,319
have seen the potential but then when it

1359
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,160
came to adoption

1360
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:13,280
There was some skepticis because there

1361
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,880
were many um some concern about safety

1362
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,960
for example and although the community

1363
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,880
fought back and and they presented cases

1364
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,559
I think when it comes to use them in

1365
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:25,040
plant you develop a very clever way to

1366
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:29,040
justify the use of carbon nanot tubes

1367
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:32,880
through the the plant sentinel model. So

1368
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:35,200
um do you think that the question that I

1369
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:37,119
have is how do you come up with the idea

1370
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,760
of the plan sending

1371
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:43,119
>> to that? Um well maybe maybe it's a

1372
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,960
reminder maybe it's it's a reminder that

1373
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:47,359
uh the solutions to the problems we

1374
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,920
heard about today may may come from

1375
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,960
inventions that that don't exist yet

1376
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,240
actually that we're still at an

1377
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:56,720
institute of te of technology and we we

1378
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,319
can we can still innovate and and pull

1379
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,319
pull pull things out. I mean I think my

1380
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,079
I I I learn a lot from my colleagues

1381
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:04,400
with respect to innovation. These are

1382
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:07,440
some of the uh the most c creative

1383
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,280
people here we have at at MIT. I think I

1384
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,160
would like to think we inspire each

1385
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:14,400
other. And uh I'll make a a comment

1386
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,119
about about the the previous big not to

1387
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,359
bring it down a notch but I have uh my

1388
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,440
lab we have more experience I think in

1389
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:23,200
licensing tech technology. We don't

1390
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,040
think about that that that as well. you

1391
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,240
can do a startup or somebody can come

1392
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:30,480
and license te technology and I I've

1393
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,839
always found that also to be an awkward

1394
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,079
process that there's you're in this

1395
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:35,839
liinal space just because someone else

1396
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,119
now has the right to your patent it

1397
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:39,440
doesn't mean all of that engineering

1398
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,680
knowhow just magically transfers we have

1399
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,680
to rely on our students sometimes people

1400
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,440
that that have already gone and and and

1401
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,440
it is awkward and there's conf conflict

1402
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,160
of interest and I found that that

1403
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,400
process could be streamlined a bit a bit

1404
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,839
better some sometimes a firm will uh

1405
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,359
hire you and your students as

1406
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:58,000
consultants for a little bit of time

1407
00:56:55,359 --> 00:57:00,559
while you go and set up shop in their in

1408
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,400
their facility. I often think maybe like

1409
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,119
my colleagues sometimes a startup would

1410
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,960
have been better a better vehicle and so

1411
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,640
if there are people out from Sloan or

1412
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,119
people that think on the on the policy

1413
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,960
side uh we definitely need attention to

1414
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,000
to that problem. I'm sorry that was a

1415
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,400
little more into the

1416
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,400
>> No, but that I think that's part of what

1417
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,599
we need to do as a body of faculty when

1418
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,160
it comes to particularly when it comes

1419
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,079
to climate technology. It will require

1420
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,920
new rules of engagement to be able to

1421
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:29,040
bring these technologies out. The usual

1422
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:32,160
model that we see doesn't work for us.

1423
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,920
And so as the innovation enterprise and

1424
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,359
the research enterprise of MIT will

1425
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,559
change in the coming years, I think that

1426
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:40,400
our voice has to be more and more heard

1427
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,559
from the whole ecosystem of innovation

1428
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,000
when it comes to what it takes and what

1429
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,880
are the challenges and the opportunities

1430
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,480
to take this deep tech outside the lab.

1431
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,880
Thank you very much. I think our time is

1432
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:54,979
up.

1433
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:54,979
[Applause]
