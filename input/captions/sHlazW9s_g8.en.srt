1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,359
okay today we are going to continue our

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,520
discussion of producer Theory remember

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,359
to set the stage I said producer theory

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,240
is like consumer Theory with one extra

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,640
step with consumer Theory I gave you a

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,960
budget constraint I gave you preferences

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,920
you could solve for what consumers were

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,399
going to do you were done

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,960
with producer Theory I can't do that

10
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,200
with producer Theory I give you a

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,399
production function which is like

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,000
utility function I give you input prices

13
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,000
which are like the prices consumers face

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,079
for pizza and cookies but there's no

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,680
income in some sense the income is

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,079
determined by the firm's production

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,800
decision firms get to choose how much

18
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,000
they want to produce so instead of one t

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,320
one relevant tangency between isoquant

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,320
and an isoc cost we end up with many

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,199
relevant tangencies which creates our

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,400
supply curve if you remember the supply

23
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:12,119
curve is the firm's marginal cost curve

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,920
above the point where it might shut down

25
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,439
okay so we did as we said we developed a

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,680
supply curve but that only tells

27
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,960
us uh so Bas supply curve tells us at

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,119
any price how much a firm wants to

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,400
produce we match that with the demand

30
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,320
curve and we get equilibrium we'll dive

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,079
back into that next lecture but today I

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:35,600
want to talk about an important

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,720
feature of the comp competitive

34
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,880
assumption remember to nail down the

35
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,840
supply curve we drew that supply curve

36
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,280
only for a particular Market assumption

37
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,280
remember with Supply Theory what's going

38
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,360
to drive the outcome is going to be the

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,680
Assumption of how we assume firms

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,200
compete we are now working within a

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,680
particular assumption on competition

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,840
which is the extreme Assumption of

43
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,200
perfect

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,520
competition okay where basically

45
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,799
consumers are totally indifferent and

46
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,560
fully

47
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,680
informed and therefore each firm faces a

48
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,000
perfectly elastic demand curve the

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,640
market demand isn't elastic necessarily

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,440
but the each firm face a perfect elastic

51
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,800
demand curve okay now La we're going to

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,200
now extend what we did last time from

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,480
the short run to the long

54
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,959
run in the long run we developed a short

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,519
run supply curve in the long run we're

56
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,480
gonna add one

57
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,879
wrinkle okay one basically extra

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,440
assumption to perfect competition so

59
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,200
talk about perfect competition in the

60
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,400
long

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,360
run we're going to add one extra

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:44,080
assumption for the long run which is

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,080
we're going to assume free entry and

64
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,959
exit that is in addition to the

65
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,640
assumptions we made last time of full

66
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,280
information and identical Goods we're

67
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,360
going to add one more assumption which

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,560
is free entry and exit that firms in the

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,120
long run are free to come and

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,680
go that assumption which seems pretty

71
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,640
harmless okay firms seem pretty free to

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,440
come and go as they like okay will

73
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,599
actually lead to an important

74
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,959
conclusion what we'll find is in the

75
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,480
long run when do firms enter firms enter

76
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,959
when there's a profit to be made when

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,080
the firms exit remember because there's

78
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,159
no shutdown in the long run it's just

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
about whether profits are greater than

80
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,480
zero or not so when the firms enter if

81
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,159
pro profits are zero greater than zero

82
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,280
when the firms exit if profits are less

83
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,799
than zero what does that mean in the

84
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,760
long run profits are always

85
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,640
zero so we're going to show you how in

86
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,519
Long Run perfect competition delivers

87
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,080
the Stark implication that long run

88
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,080
profits in the market are zero not short

89
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,879
run short run you can make money but in

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,080
the long run if you're ever making money

91
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,239
more firms are going to enter until

92
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,560
profits are driven to zero okay so to

93
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,360
see this I want to go to a particularly

94
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,840
old example relevant for my lifetime not

95
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,840
yours which is the market for personal

96
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,760
computers Circa

97
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,239
1990 okay the mark so and I DW this now

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,480
this is the first of many times in this

99
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,280
class we're going to do sort of go back

100
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,680
and forth in side by-side diagrams so

101
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,400
figure 8.1 I'm going to go through

102
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,199
slowly but please if it's not clear ask

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,320
me questions okay now we are going to

104
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,799
look at the market for personal

105
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,680
computers this is just when personal

106
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,000
computers were starting to take off

107
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,800
there are only a few firms there was

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,639
Dell Gateway you probably even heard of

109
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,360
them they were a big personal computer

110
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,440
firm back in the day there were a few

111
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,280
firms firms that produce PCS but it was

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,120
a pretty New Market in

113
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,199
1990 okay pretty New Market okay and

114
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,520
what we're going to assume is we're

115
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,639
going to assume this is a perfectly

116
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,800
competitive

117
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,400
market and we'll assume that that all

118
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,160
the producers are identical that any new

119
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,240
pc company is identical the ones that

120
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,039
came before it you can already see why

121
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,880
these are silly assumptions and we'll

122
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,000
talk about that later but that's how per

123
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,960
that's the kind of assumption we make in

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,560
perfect

125
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:04,840
competition okay now so what you have is

126
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,680
in the left hand side of figure

127
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,759
81 you have a

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,280
firm's production decision you have

129
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,600
their marginal cost curves so this is

130
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,199
say the firm is Dell okay one of several

131
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,600
firms that producing PCS in this market

132
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,160
you have their marginal cost curve which

133
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,000
is upward sloping okay you have their

134
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,440
average cost curve which is curved which

135
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,720
is a which is a parabola because

136
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,840
basically they first pay off their fixed

137
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,720
costs and then they have Rising marginal

138
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,319
cost remember the marginal cost curve

139
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,360
intersects the average cost curve at the

140
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,680
minimum of average

141
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,840
cost so that's the firm's that's the

142
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,919
firm's production decision now I want

143
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,440
you to carry that over so where's the

144
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,360
firm could produce in the short run

145
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,360
they'll produce where the market price

146
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,080
little

147
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,440
P1 equals their marginal cost so once

148
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,639
again focusing on the left hand side of

149
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,160
figure 81 The Firm will choose to

150
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:05,440
produce at the point little

151
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,520
q1 they will make a profit because

152
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,960
marginal cost is above because they'll

153
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,759
make a profit because marginal cost is

154
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,479
above average cost at that point they'll

155
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,440
make a profit of the entire lightly

156
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:19,560
dotted area called Pi

157
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,919
1 okay questions about that this is the

158
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,639
firm's production decision okay they

159
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,039
will choose price equal marginal cost

160
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,800
which happens at Point little q1 that

161
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,000
will deliver profits which is the

162
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,120
difference between price and average

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,639
cost

164
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,199
times the number of units produced and

165
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,599
that'll be the lightly dotted rectangle

166
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,520
Pi

167
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:40,800
1 now if we take that over to the market

168
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:43,800
with only one firm in the market they

169
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,800
will then have some supply curve

170
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,160
S1 in the market that supply curve if

171
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,880
the price is little

172
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,919
P1 and the supply curve is S1 then the

173
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,120
mark produce big

174
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,080
q1 okay so basically there's a big q1 is

175
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,479
a quantity produced in the

176
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,800
market okay but now flipping back to the

177
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,759
left hand side of the diagram what's

178
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,639
happened there's lots of

179
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,039
profit what does lots of profit mean

180
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,280
with free entry and exit that means more

181
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:21,080
firms will enter the

182
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,720
market as more firms enter what happens

183
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,840
to supply curve we learned this last

184
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,280
time as more firms enter the supply

185
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,000
curve flattens because as more identical

186
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,120
firms the supply supply curve gets

187
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,440
flatter it's just from S1 to

188
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,759
S2 so the supply curve flattens at a

189
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,800
flatter supply

190
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,720
curve at a flatter supply curve now um

191
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,879
you're going to get uh at a flatter

192
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,639
supply curve you will now get that

193
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:53,639
they'll be more produced at a lower

194
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:56,319
price so you'll get Q2 big Q2 but the

195
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,759
price will fall to to

196
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,199
P2 what happens when the price Falls to

197
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:05,599
P2 will now go back to the left hand

198
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,759
side when the price is P2 D now only

199
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,039
produces little

200
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,319
Q2 because the they produce where price

201
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:14,879
equals marginal cost they produce little

202
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,840
Q2 and that leads to a much smaller

203
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,039
profit Pi 2 so once again let me go

204
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,240
through the math they choose originally

205
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:25,120
little q1 at P1 that you shift to the

206
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:29,080
right creates a supply you've got a

207
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,720
supply curve that yields profits of Pi 1

208
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,399
due to those profits more firms enter

209
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,120
the supply curve flattens as Supply

210
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,880
curves flattens the price Falls shifting

211
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,760
back to the left that delivers a lower

212
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,519
profit note that little Q2 is to the

213
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,440
left of little q1 but big Q2 is to the

214
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,800
right of big q1 why is

215
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,360
that yeah more firms remember because

216
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,120
little Q is what Dell's producing big Q

217
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,800
is what the Market's

218
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,560
producing well but there's still profits

219
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,480
so what's going to happen more firms are

220
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,120
going to enter

221
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,519
and firms are going to enter until

222
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,360
profits are zero because as long as

223
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,640
those profits are positive firms can

224
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,560
enter so we've shown how entry drives

225
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,200
profits down but there's still profits

226
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,240
being made Pi too so some other company

227
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,040
will say hey this is still a good

228
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,399
business to be and they'll enter and

229
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,399
they'll enter until profits go to

230
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,760
zero because if profits are greater than

231
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:29,800
zero there's incentive to enter so firms

232
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:33,000
will enter until profits go to zero

233
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,880
now let's imagine a different

234
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,920
Market the market for mainframe

235
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,480
computers you guys don't even know that

236
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,640
term when I graduated MIT in 1987 our

237
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,600
graduation speaker was was uh Kenneth

238
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,880
Dell Ken I'm sorry Ken olssen Ken Olsen

239
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,000
who founded deck which was the big main

240
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,560
he was it was an MIT base he was an MIT

241
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,040
guy started this company called deck

242
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,240
they were dominant huge companies they

243
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,800
made these huge mainframe computers and

244
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,040
he gave this speech in

245
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,360
1987 about my graduation so first lesson

246
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,800
of graduation speeches if any of you

247
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,399
should ever give them I haven't given

248
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,440
one but if every should the position is

249
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,000
you don't spend the whole speech just

250
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,839
talking about how wonderful you are well

251
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,399
that's what he did spent those spee how

252
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,040
wonderful he was how deck was incredible

253
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,360
how awesome they were five years later

254
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,560
they're basically out of business why

255
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,040
because they got wiped out by PCS

256
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,320
because people went on maybe 10 years

257
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,000
later they're essentially out of

258
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,279
business okay because they got wiped out

259
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,040
by PCS okay well so let's look at the

260
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,560
market for mainframe computers and let's

261
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,839
look at a big company that produc frame

262
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,640
computers

263
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,120
IBM okay so mainframe computers they

264
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,360
were just big they're what we call

265
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,800
servers today but you basically we sort

266
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,639
of gone to transition almost back to

267
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,480
that model but we sort of went to a

268
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:44,839
decentralized PC model now we're back to

269
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,399
sort of a model where there's PC is just

270
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,120
a node onto some onto the cloud think in

271
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,200
that area you had a you had a you had a

272
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,440
terminal it wasn't a standalone machine

273
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,680
it was a terminal onto a Mainframe okay

274
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,920
so it's sort of a different version of

275
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,880
what we have today so IBM was making

276
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,720
those IBM was poo pooing PC just as much

277
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:07,760
as deck was and they were originally at

278
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:11,240
S1 there's a supply curve S1 with a

279
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,480
price q1 with a quantity big q1 now what

280
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,160
happened was people stopped wanting

281
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,639
mainframes so they were losing

282
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,120
money okay IBM had invested big in

283
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:23,279
mainframes they didn't believe the PC

284
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,519
was going to work and they were losing

285
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,120
money because people didn't want main

286
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,399
frames anymore so at their original

287
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,160
supply curve S1 which involved IBM and

288
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,200
deck and all these

289
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,560
companies there's money being lost so if

290
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,720
we go to IBM's case so basically S1 was

291
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:44,079
the market supply curve S1 intersected

292
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:47,639
demand at Big q1 at a price of P1 if you

293
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:50,200
take that over to IBM's curve P1

294
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,040
intersect the marginal cost curve at a

295
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,880
point where they produce q1 little q1 on

296
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,959
the leftand side of figure A2 so I've

297
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,240
now moved to the left hand side of

298
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:01,440
figure A2 I've been producing little q1

299
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,839
at little q1 their profits they're

300
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,800
negative because marginal cost is below

301
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,760
average cost they're losing money now

302
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,200
there's still above the shutdown Point

303
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,959
look look they they haven't reached the

304
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,480
bottom of their marginal cost curve if

305
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:16,320
the price fell far enough they'd shut

306
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,760
down but it hasn't they're still

307
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,800
producing they're just losing money

308
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,160
because they still they're still because

309
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,320
basically remember last time as long as

310
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,000
their variable costs are below the price

311
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,040
they still want to produce so in this

312
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,800
case they're still producing the

313
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,040
variable cost still below theice price

314
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,720
they're just losing money what happens

315
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:39,680
when you lose money firms exit like deck

316
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,279
firms exit that that that steepens the

317
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,800
supply curve just like firms entering

318
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,639
flatten supply curve firms exit that

319
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,360
steepens the supply curve okay you

320
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,639
steepen the supply curve that raises the

321
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,760
price and at this point I've drawn it

322
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,199
raised the price to P2 where IBM is

323
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,000
basically making zero profits so the way

324
00:12:55,199 --> 00:13:01,399
I've drawn it okay we've gone from q1 to

325
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,800
Q2 that's raised the price to P2 at P2

326
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,760
price equals marginal cost equals

327
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,720
average cost and profits are

328
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:12,440
zero this is the lesson that we derive

329
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,440
which is entry will happen till profits

330
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:18,079
are zero and exit will happen to profits

331
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,600
are zero so what does that mean profits

332
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:24,000
are zero in the long run okay so what

333
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,920
that means is that the long run go to

334
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,760
figure

335
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:38,040
83 okay the long run supply curve is

336
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:42,199
flat each firm will be pushed to produce

337
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,360
to the point where price equals minimum

338
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:46,880
average

339
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,279
cost each firm will be pushed to produce

340
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,120
to the point where marginal cost equals

341
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,959
average cost so basically entry and exit

342
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,240
will drive profits to

343
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:59,959
zero we know that profits are only zero

344
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,320
when marginal cost equals average cost

345
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,800
if marginal cost doesn't equal average

346
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,199
cost as profits or losses so profits go

347
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,720
to zero profits margin cost equals

348
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:10,600
average cost and we know that only

349
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,880
happens at minimum average cost that's

350
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,199
the point where marginal cost equals

351
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,800
average cost there's your little proof

352
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:18,399
okay basically profits go to zero which

353
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,959
means marginal costs have to equal

354
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,000
average costs which only happens at

355
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:25,240
minimum average cost so in the long run

356
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
every firm produces at minimum average

357
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,519
cost that is every firm produces at

358
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,160
maximum efficiency

359
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,480
they minimize their cost so they

360
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,120
maximize their

361
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,120
efficiency so the long run supply curve

362
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,440
is flat at the minimum average cost

363
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,720
remember we assume firms are identical

364
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,920
so every firm is identical minimum

365
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,720
average cost okay so the long run supply

366
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,079
curve with perfect

367
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,800
competition with identical

368
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:54,880
firms with free entry and exit the long

369
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,240
run supply curve will be at the firm's

370
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,240
minimum average cost and profits will be

371
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,240
zero

372
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,720
okay questions about

373
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:15,000
that now you might say to me um John uh

374
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:18,160
that seems a little bit odd because um

375
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,720
profits aren't zero Apple makes ungodly

376
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,240
amounts of money tons of companies make

377
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,839
ungodly amounts of money so you've

378
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,360
really kind of I I I you know I I I

379
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,600
bought your pizza cookies thing but this

380
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,319
is getting ridiculous I can't buy a

381
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,040
model where companies don't make profits

382
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:34,279
there wouldn't be a stock market you

383
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,000
know they're basically what's going on

384
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,480
well two things are going on the first

385
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,720
thing going on the easiest an remember

386
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,880
the companies can still make profits in

387
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,759
the short

388
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,560
run okay so still short run profits but

389
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,440
you know you look at many companies

390
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,759
General Motors has made profits for

391
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,000
decades and decades and decades they'

392
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,800
blipped up and down but it's not like

393
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,959
they only make profits in the short run

394
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,920
there are plenty of companies that

395
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,160
around a long time making

396
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,120
profits so it can't just be that they're

397
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,360
around because they make profits in the

398
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,519
short run so basically what's going on

399
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,000
what's going on is that there's not free

400
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,279
entry and

401
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,800
exit Okay well no I'm sorry let me back

402
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,160
up that was too extreme what's going on

403
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,120
is there's a number of complications to

404
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,440
this simple model and we got to Dive

405
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,399
Right into them because this is really

406
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,800
sort of an unrealistic prediction it's a

407
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,319
good extreme it's a good teaching

408
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,800
example you will come back to it in

409
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:24,360
problem sets and exams to remember that

410
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,199
are all the assumptions of perfect

411
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,160
competition Long Run profits are

412
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:33,360
zero but in reality they're not so let's

413
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,440
talk about why there's really three

414
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,920
reasons why long run profits might not

415
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,920
be zero the first is limited

416
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:47,079
entry I assumed the profits of the PC

417
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,399
industry got driven to Zero by entry but

418
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:51,279
that's not true because in particular

419
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,000
there exist in the world things we call

420
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,000
barriers to

421
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,720
entry there are costs which are barriers

422
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:04,480
to entry in particular the ultimate

423
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,480
barriers to entry is sunk

424
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,559
costs because once someone's in the

425
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
market hav paid the sunk costs if you're

426
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:16,720
looking at entering okay think about a

427
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,880
doct you be a doctor if you make doctors

428
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,120
an economic decision you want to go look

429
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,839
at how much money you'll make compared

430
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,240
to the cost you'll sink into med

431
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,720
school well if profits are sufficiently

432
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,480
clo being a doctor aren't very big

433
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,320
you're not going to sink 300 Grand into

434
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,799
med school you're gonna say forget it so

435
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,240
as long as profits aren't too big you

436
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:38,600
won't go become a doctor so profits

437
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,919
don't profits can't be enormous but they

438
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,880
can be driven not all the way to zero

439
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:44,360
they're driven to the point where unless

440
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,720
you can pay off your sun cost you don't

441
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,679
want to do it okay so basically entry

442
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,120
will happen not freely but entry will

443
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,960
happen only if you can make enough money

444
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,919
eventually to pay off your sun costs

445
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,280
orse you won't you won't do it there's

446
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,520
lots of these barriers to entry

447
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,280
that are basically exist in the world

448
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,039
with Pharmaceuticals it's

449
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,280
patents even in the little market that I

450
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:09,720
described our perfectly competitive

451
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,919
example Market outside the Eiffel Tower

452
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,559
maybe if you try to set up another

453
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,679
blanket someone will come beat you up

454
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,720
okay and you've got to decide is it

455
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:17,919
worth the punches I take to make the

456
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,320
money and if the answer is profits are

457
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,960
truly zero you won't take the punches

458
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,360
you just won't set up your blanket okay

459
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,880
there's basically lots of barriers to

460
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,440
entry in the real world if there's

461
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,440
barriers to entry

462
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,799
then firms will not enter till that

463
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,000
point the profit goes to zero they'll

464
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:39,960
stop at a point profit they're still

465
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,440
positive okay so that's one example of

466
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,039
why you might end up with positive

467
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,280
profits in the long

468
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,799
run the second example is a little more

469
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,240
complicated but important which is firms

470
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,240
are not

471
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:59,159
identical and in

472
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:01,000
particular firms May differ at what

473
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,320
their minimum average cost

474
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,520
is and if firms differ what their

475
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,799
minimum average cost is you can end up

476
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,400
with the lowest average cost firms

477
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,520
making

478
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,760
money okay so basically you can enter

479
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,520
you can end up with the lowest average

480
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,919
cost firms making

481
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,440
money okay so to see this let's look at

482
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,960
figure 84 which is sort of confusing but

483
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,320
it gives sort of an example if there's

484
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,679
time in section we'll do sort of a more

485
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,679
complicated example but this is sort of

486
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,840
a simple

487
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,120
example this is an old example some a

488
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,600
real empirical study that was done a

489
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,000
long time ago of the marginal cost of

490
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,400
producing cotton in different countries

491
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,320
so here we're just assuming flat

492
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,720
marginal cost curves okay we're ignoring

493
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,080
just assume not output slow just assume

494
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,360
it's just a it's just a constant

495
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,640
marginal cost a flat supply curve a

496
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,480
constant marginal cost of producing

497
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,919
cotton you might say well in that case

498
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,760
obviously with free entry profits are

499
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,080
zero but in fact it turns out that cost

500
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,799
is different in different places it only

501
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,360
cost 71 cents a

502
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,000
kilogram to produce cotton Pakistan

503
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,080
because I mean I'm sure that's changed

504
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,360
now but Labor's cheap things like that

505
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,120
there's it's good good growing

506
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,039
conditions for

507
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,320
cotton

508
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:12,880
Argentina their lowest cost they can

509
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,240
produce cotton their minimum average

510
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,840
cost is a dollar eight Australia is a15

511
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,200
all the way up to the United States

512
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,840
where it's a$1 56 to produce a kilogram

513
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,400
of cotton okay so just assume in this

514
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,760
case bear with me think of margin class

515
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,280
is just one number it's a constant

516
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,880
number okay and that marginal cost is

517
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:38,039
higher in the US than it is

518
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:42,280
in Pakistan now what happens in this

519
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:44,880
market if the demand for cotton is 1

520
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,880
billion kilograms per year who makes the

521
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,880
cotton how much profit did they

522
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,200
make and what's the price let's say

523
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,640
demand is 1 billion kilograms per year

524
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:58,919
what happens who makes the cotton what's

525
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,919
the price and how much profits they make

526
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:08,840
anyone you got this you know the answer

527
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,640
yeah Pakistan makes it at what

528
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,320
price they make it at 71 cents and

529
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,320
therefore what's their

530
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,760
profit zero right price equals marginal

531
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,000
cost equals average cost if marginal

532
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,320
cost is flat average cost is flat so

533
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,520
price equals Marg cost equals average

534
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,039
cost so in a world that's the example we

535
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,000
just did in a world the perfect

536
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,000
competition profits are zero

537
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,559
yeah well basically that's a great

538
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,919
question because presumably within

539
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,919
Pakistan there's multiple companies

540
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,200
competing and if one company tried to

541
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,799
sell for higher than 71 the other would

542
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,159
come in and sell for 71 okay it's weird

543
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,760
to think of a country level supply curve

544
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:55,520
but that's s the logic but now let's say

545
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,760
the demand curve is such that there's

546
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:03,080
five billion kilograms demanded

547
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,919
if demand is five billion what is the

548
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,159
market

549
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:10,880
price if the demand for cotton is five

550
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,520
billion what's the market

551
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,440
price

552
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,919
yeah right this is a supply curve this

553
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,400
Red Line supply curve demand equal

554
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,840
Supply at

555
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,600
156 so what are profits in the US at

556
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,360
that

557
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:29,720
price what are profits in

558
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,240
Pakistan 85 cents

559
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,120
so in a

560
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,279
world where there are where to meet

561
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,440
demand you need to draw on less

562
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:39,279
efficient firms the more efficient firms

563
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,960
can make

564
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,840
money okay this is a confusing Point

565
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,240
let's go back and remember what drove

566
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,440
the last example I'm saying was the

567
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,039
assumption that all firms were identical

568
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,760
that led to this flat Supply cover at

569
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:53,279
long range average cost but in fact when

570
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,799
firms aren't identical as some are more

571
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,520
efficient than others the more efficient

572
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:59,080
firms can still make money even in the

573
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,919
long run

574
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,720
as long as demand exceeds their marginal

575
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:06,080
as long as demand exceeds their part of

576
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,520
the supply curve they can still make

577
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,600
money okay so another reason why there

578
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,400
could be profits in the long run is

579
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,159
because particularly efficient firms can

580
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:19,120
make profits if demand is sufficiently

581
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,120
high okay questions about that

582
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,840
yeah

583
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,240
yeah oh Pakistan well the point is

584
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,279
Pakistan will make more but think of

585
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,799
Pakistan's supply curve as such it's a

586
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,919
great question think of Pakistan's

587
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:38,760
supply curve as such that after they've

588
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,120
made 1.7 million kilograms of cotton

589
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,960
their cost just goes through the roof so

590
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,240
that's sort of the way we think about it

591
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,000
but you're right they could make more

592
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,000
and make even more

593
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:54,520
profits all right okay so that's a

594
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,799
second reason why you could end up with

595
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,880
long run profits the third reason is

596
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,440
quite different

597
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,159
the third reason hint it's something

598
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,520
we'll start talking about in a few

599
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,520
lectures which is that input

600
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:17,400
prices may depend on

601
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,400
quantity or or they do input prices

602
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:24,039
depend on

603
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,399
quantity that is as you produce more the

604
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:29,240
cost of buying inputs could

605
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:31,320
rise okay so to see this I'm now going

606
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,000
to skip ahead something we'll talk about

607
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,679
much more in a few lectures which is

608
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,120
let's look at the market for labor

609
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,760
remember so far in this class we've

610
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,880
taken labor the wage of Labor as just

611
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,760
given from God but now we're going to

612
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,760
talk about where that comes from it

613
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,000
comes from the market for labor so let's

614
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,600
go to

615
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,960
figure uh

616
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,120
85 figure 85 is the kind of figure we're

617
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,520
to start working with in a few lectures

618
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,799
it's the classic Supply demand figure

619
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:03,520
quantity on the x- axis price on the y-

620
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,679
AIS the difference is the quantity is

621
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,159
not the number of cookies it's the hours

622
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,640
of work or number of workers and the

623
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,399
price is not the price of a cookie it's

624
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:16,799
the wage the wage is the price of Labor

625
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:18,760
so this is a demand and supply curve for

626
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,840
workers why not you can draw demand

627
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:25,120
supply for anything so like any demand

628
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,360
supply curve we have a demand for

629
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,360
workers the demand for workers is that

630
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,320
downward

631
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,520
sloping okay why is the demand for

632
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,480
workers downward

633
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:41,080
sloping okay it's downward sloping

634
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,559
because as the price of Labor goes up

635
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,080
firms want less of

636
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,320
it right we've know this if you go back

637
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,520
to your underlying production theory if

638
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,080
you solve for optimal those isoquants

639
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,480
and isocost we know is the isocost shift

640
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,640
that's going to change your production

641
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,039
mix you're going to end up wanting as

642
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,720
the ice as labor gets more expensive you

643
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:02,360
want fewer

644
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,480
workers okay so therefore as the price

645
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,760
of Labor goes up they want fewer workers

646
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,360
that's why the demand is downward

647
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,200
sloping why is the supply upward sloping

648
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,799
can anyone tell me why is supply of

649
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,799
labor upward

650
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,600
sloping

651
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,799
yeah exactly the assumption is and I'll

652
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,880
teach you a few lectures it's only an

653
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,240
assumption I like the the celebration

654
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,000
there that's good good good good answer

655
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,640
um I the it's only it's only an uh an

656
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,840
assumption but the Assumption we're

657
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,279
making here is as there's more wages

658
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,640
more people want to work as wages go up

659
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,360
people want to work harder more people

660
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,679
want to work there want to work harder

661
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,520
supply curve slopes up and you end up in

662
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,200
some

663
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:50,080
equilibrium L1

664
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,840
W1 now imagine that people suddenly want

665
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,960
more of a

666
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,360
good well if they want more of a good

667
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,320
and that's in some other diagram that's

668
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,640
not in this diagram it's the labor

669
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,080
market diagram there some other diagram

670
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,159
people want more of a good good if

671
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,760
people want more of a good you need to

672
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:05,000
hire more

673
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,480
workers how do we represent that here

674
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,039
well that means there's an increase in

675
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,080
demand for

676
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:12,760
workers that means there's a shift

677
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,440
outward in the demand curve to D of

678
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,480
Q2 okay once again people want more

679
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,799
rivets or whatever we're producing to

680
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,720
produce more rivets you need more

681
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,000
workers that's a shift outward in the

682
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,720
demand for workers what does that do

683
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,480
well that increase the number of workers

684
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,960
but it also raises the wage the price of

685
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,840
Labor

686
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,919
with an upward sloping supply curve

687
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,240
you're going to find that if you want

688
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,279
more workers you're going to have to pay

689
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,600
more to get them right so think of the

690
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,640
firm's decision I want to make more

691
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,919
rivets I need more workers well I'm in

692
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,519
equilibrium my current level of workers

693
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,000
they are are happy at the wage I'm

694
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,200
offering I'm getting the right number of

695
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,240
workers if I want more workers I'm have

696
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,600
to raise the

697
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,559
wage well if I raise the wage that feeds

698
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:58,440
back to my marginal costs and that leads

699
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,440
to something like figure 86

700
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,159
okay so basically when I was producing

701
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,159
before I was at

702
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:09,000
MC1 and

703
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,919
ac1 now I want to produce more and I was

704
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,159
producing at little q1 at Price P1 I

705
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,559
want to produce more I produce little Q2

706
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,120
well for this little Q2 I've got to

707
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:22,360
raise the wage if I raise the wage that

708
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,240
raises my marginal average costs so I

709
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:29,720
shift to the new mc2 and

710
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:32,679
ac2 and my costs are higher

711
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,919
so now you actually see an upward

712
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:38,440
sloping supply

713
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:41,399
curve that as the wage goes

714
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,320
up costs go as as you I'm sorry as you

715
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:47,480
produce more your costs go

716
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,279
up because you have to pay more for your

717
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,519
inputs so what happens is my my marginal

718
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:56,159
cost shes from MC1 to mc2 so I have to

719
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,080
sell at a higher price to break even to

720
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,039
get to that point where margin cost

721
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,039
equals average cost that that efficient

722
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:05,799
point at E2 I've got to charge a higher

723
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,640
price so now you see an upward sloping

724
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:10,600
supply curve so this is a perfectly

725
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,799
competitive market notice firms are

726
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:16,279
making zero

727
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,559
profits okay in both E1 and E2 the firms

728
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:20,880
making zero little E1 and little E2

729
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,360
profits are zero how do we know because

730
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,679
marginal cost is equal to minimum

731
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,399
average

732
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,679
cost yet even though they making zero

733
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,480
profits when you want more Goods the

734
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,519
price has to rise and that's because

735
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,799
they have to hire more workers and

736
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:38,679
that's the key distinction between cases

737
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:42,120
one and two in case three in case one

738
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:44,559
and two barriers to entry or firms not

739
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,039
identical leads to Long Run profits

740
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,039
greater than

741
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,519
zero but in case three long run profits

742
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,519
are still

743
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,200
zero it's important distinction in case

744
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,399
three long profit are still zirm firms

745
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,000
are still producing at their minimum

746
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:04,840
average cost every firm is it's just the

747
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,399
supply curves upward sloping so I I I

748
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,120
said this a comp this is a complication

749
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,679
which doesn't explain law that's why I

750
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,679
backed off and said there's long run

751
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,159
profits there's still not long run

752
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,559
profits but there is a long run upward

753
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,919
sloping supply curve so what I concluded

754
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,360
a few minutes ago is a long run flat

755
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,760
supply curve meant Zero

756
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,600
profits here we're actually in a long

757
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,440
run upward sloping supply curve in zero

758
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:32,559
profits why because we have to pay more

759
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,480
for labor as we produce more so a long

760
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,600
in the long run now this once again

761
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,440
still unrealistic because we know

762
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,240
profits aren't zero in the long run it's

763
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,200
just showing you can't assume as someone

764
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,679
might ask you to in a problem assume

765
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,080
that because as long one Supply curves

766
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,240
upward sloping there's profits to be

767
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,240
made that's not necessarily true here's

768
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,960
a case where there's no profits in these

769
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,840
cases the long one Supply curves upward

770
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,559
sloping and there are profits being

771
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,200
made okay that's a lot that's confusing

772
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,840
let me pause pause for questions about

773
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,840
any of that any of that

774
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,840
stuff

775
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:17,360
yeah I right now I'm just uh the Lark

776
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,679
supply curve is upward sloping by

777
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,000
assumption I'm talking about creating

778
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:25,840
upward sloping in figure 86 so comp

779
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,039
piure figure 86 to figure um

780
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,399
83 okay okay in figure Figure 8 three

781
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,600
you see that every firm produced their

782
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,200
minimum average cost you I could have

783
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,639
drawn a whole bunch of firms here they'd

784
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,200
all be at that same price or a whole

785
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:39,440
bunch of quantities say all the same

786
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,000
price now what I'm saying in figure 86

787
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,840
is no as the quantity goes up you got to

788
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,799
pay you get a higher price even though

789
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,240
profits are still zero okay good

790
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,240
question

791
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,480
yeah uh once again we don't have income

792
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,279
substitution effects here because it's

793
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,799
not um it's not the income substitution

794
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,559
effects come from sort of cons come from

795
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,919
underlying consumer preferences these

796
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,639
are firm decisions so we're not getting

797
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,159
income and substitution effects the way

798
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:09,360
you care about one two verse three is

799
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:10,760
ask are there long run profits so if you

800
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,840
if you want to ask which is the right

801
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,279
case this's an easy test are profits

802
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,440
zero in the long run profit zero in the

803
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,159
long run then either our base case is

804
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,639
true or this so we have four total cases

805
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:24,000
we have our base case and then we have

806
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:25,200
these three complications both the base

807
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,039
case and this third complication

808
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,760
delivers one prediction which long

809
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,600
profits of zero these two deliver a

810
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,639
different prediction which long and

811
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,559
profits are greater than zero now

812
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:34,639
differentiating between each of those

813
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,600
pairs of cases that'll involve

814
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:37,639
additional

815
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,159
testing okay so for example

816
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:41,000
differentiating between the base case

817
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:42,880
and this case you differentiate

818
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,960
empirically by asking do wages rise as

819
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,080
quantity

820
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,639
Rises differ in these cases you

821
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,880
differentiate by asking will our firms

822
00:32:47,639 --> 00:32:56,480
identical or are there some costs Etc

823
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,480
okay good question other questions yeah

824
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,960
that's an awesome Point Apple's Apple's

825
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,639
$8 millionar $8 billion dollar per

826
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,960
quarter profits not bad uh are

827
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:20,960
accounting profits what are economic

828
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,399
profits that's a great question and that

829
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,480
is much much harder uh now to be fair at

830
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:27,799
one level it's harder let's it's not

831
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,279
like accounting profits are easy because

832
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:31,679
Apple gets to make up their

833
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,840
numbers okay so let me give you a simple

834
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,519
example of what Apple does um Apple by

835
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,480
the way makes $18 billion in reported

836
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,919
profits uh to their stockholders to the

837
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,760
US government they report profits of

838
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:48,000
zero they report $8 billion to their

839
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,320
stakeholders but to the tax authorities

840
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,600
to whom they pay taxes they report

841
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:55,440
profits of zero essentially why well

842
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,519
because they play a game where they

843
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,919
pretend they have a company in Ireland

844
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,639
with two

845
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:05,120
employees they CLA but Ireland has low

846
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:07,320
taxes they claim that all their profits

847
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,679
are earned in Ireland how can they do

848
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,440
that only two employees they claim that

849
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,960
their profits come from intellectual

850
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,960
property intellectual property is housed

851
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,040
in Ireland with those two

852
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,079
employees okay so accounting profits are

853
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,200
not necessarily right either you know

854
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:23,599
accounting profits are not so clean but

855
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,879
economic profits would be very very hard

856
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,040
economic profits economic cost is also

857
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:29,919
very hard to measure there is measuring

858
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:32,000
firm profits and that's why in some

859
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,079
sense many of us would say well look

860
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,639
there's an easy answer to economic

861
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:36,639
problem there's tax firms that make all

862
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,599
the profits the problem is what are

863
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,440
profits and it's very hard to measure

864
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:44,399
both economically and for accounting

865
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,399
reasons great question other

866
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,159
questions yeah in the figure 85 where

867
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,320
there's like you talked about how the

868
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:56,040
demand cve shift or the cost of the

869
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,280
wages shift based on the demand cve

870
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,680
shift which is in relation to the market

871
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:04,440
demand but then does the supply curve

872
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,680
ever shift adjust for the increased cost

873
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,359
well no but the supply curve is

874
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,520
determined that's a good question supply

875
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,280
curve is determined by the workers's

876
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,520
preference for how they want to work

877
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,200
nothing's changed that it's just it's

878
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,320
just the supply curve is just how much

879
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,960
more do I want to work when the wage

880
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,160
goes up and that's just fixed that could

881
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,480
change and we'll talk about that in a

882
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,800
few lectures in fact we'll tell you a

883
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,079
few lectures why it might not even slope

884
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,119
up it might slope down and that's good

885
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:27,200
about then the our big income and

886
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,640
substitution effects fan here will have

887
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,000
uh we'll have some to talk about uh

888
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,320
question like assumtion of like comp

889
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,560
also workers that mean the long run all

890
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,040
workers make no profit wonderful

891
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,280
wonderful point and we will come back to

892
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,720
that as well when we talk about well do

893
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,880
a whole lecture on how workers make

894
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,720
their decision how to work and we'll

895
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,960
come to that point okay great questions

896
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,800
all right well let's follow up on the

897
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,119
Apple

898
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,839
discussion to talk

899
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,359
about something that once again let's

900
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:00,720
let's let's interject the real world

901
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:03,880
here for one second and

902
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,720
ask do firms actually maximize

903
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,960
profits we assume that we assume fors

904
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,319
maximized profit there's no reason not

905
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,240
to or the logic is pretty impeccable but

906
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:13,720
in fact we see a lot of things that

907
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,520
don't look like firms are maximizing

908
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,119
profits so for example uh in

909
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,040
2010

910
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,680
Amgen lost 3% of their market value in

911
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:28,400
7% over the past five years yet their

912
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:32,480
CEO made $21 million

913
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,119
in 2008 the CEO of abomi and Fitch who

914
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,640
stock V had dropped

915
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:41,280
71% was paid $72 million that's a lot of

916
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,480
money based off ABS good ABS right and

917
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,440
then finally here's um then we have the

918
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,200
case of Leo apecer who was CEO of hulet

919
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,280
Packard for 11 months and it was so

920
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,520
disastrous they F fired him after 11

921
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:58,359
months and he made $13

922
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:00,119
million okay so the question is

923
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:02,280
if firms really maximize profits how can

924
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,599
be paying all these outrageous amounts

925
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,359
of money to employees that don't

926
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,880
necessarily seem to be doing such a good

927
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:12,000
job and there's two answers to that one

928
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,760
answer is well look we don't one answer

929
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
is the opportunity cost we don't know

930
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,200
what would happened if those CEOs hadn't

931
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,720
been in place maybe they would have lost

932
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,359
120% of their value maybe they would

933
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:26,280
have done even worse maybe these highly

934
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:29,800
paid CEOs are worth it look a great

935
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,040
example is Michael Jordan Michael Jordan

936
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,920
there was an academic study which

937
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,160
measured the value of Michael Jordan

938
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,040
Michael Jordan was the highest paid

939
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,079
player in basketball at 1 Point $32

940
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,160
million a year someone did a study based

941
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:43,880
on the ad revenues that are generated by

942
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,720
increased viewership when Michael Jordan

943
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,800
was on TV and based that he was worth a

944
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,960
hundred million a year so he was

945
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,400
actually underpaid at 32

946
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,359
million okay so basically the point is

947
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,079
just because someone's paid a lot

948
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,640
doesn't mean they're not worth it okay

949
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,560
we can't just look at some some page and

950
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,400
say they're not worth it that's one uh

951
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,760
explanation however that one doesn't

952
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,720
seem to work and the way it noce the

953
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,960
work is a super clever test that was

954
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,920
done by Professor Sloan at Shore and a

955
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,839
now a new professor um in the computer

956
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,839
science department sen mull Nathan they

957
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:22,000
did a very cool test they said um uh

958
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:24,520
actually Mel and Mar betron to Chicago

959
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,000
what they said is look let's look at

960
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,640
what happens to how much CEOs of oil

961
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,839
companies get paid when the price of oil

962
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,720
goes up when the price of oils goes up

963
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:37,760
oil company profits go up but it's not

964
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,760
due to anything a CEO did the price of

965
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,760
oil is determined by a World Market no

966
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,960
one CEO can have any influence on the

967
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,880
price of

968
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,520
oil so if the profits go up because the

969
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,880
price of oil goes up CEOs shouldn't be

970
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,079
rewarded for that they did nothing and

971
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,280
yet they find that when Pro oil prices

972
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,040
go up CEOs get massive raises in oil

973
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,920
companies that can't be that they're

974
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,000
doing a particularly good job that's got

975
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,960
to be something else okay so what's the

976
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,280
something else the something else is to

977
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,160
recognize that firms are not just some

978
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:12,119
blackbox little little Q function or F

979
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,839
function firms are actually a

980
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:16,839
complicated set of what we call agency

981
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,160
relationships a complicated set of

982
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,960
agency

983
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,760
relationships what do we mean by that we

984
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,119
mean that when you think of the firm in

985
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,800
this course we're thinking about

986
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:36,000
something like someone working for

987
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,359
themselves or pair of Partners where the

988
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,640
workers are the

989
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,520
owners but most firms most of the goods

990
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,240
in America not most firms most of the

991
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:48,400
goods in America are produced by giant

992
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,440
corporations and the key Hallmark of a

993
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,680
corporation is the

994
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,440
separation of ownership from

995
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,800
control corporations are owned by

996
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:02,560
disembodied set of stockholders but the

997
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,760
decisions are made by employees managers

998
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,359
who work at those

999
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,240
firms and that separation of ownership

1000
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,839
and

1001
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:15,160
control leads to a fundamental challenge

1002
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:17,599
which for which uh uh my former

1003
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,400
colleague B Holstrom won the Nobel Prize

1004
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,000
was one7 won the Nobel Prize for

1005
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,800
documenting this fundamental tension

1006
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,839
understanding it which is when you have

1007
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,760
the owners different from the

1008
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:30,000
managers the managers don't don't have

1009
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,640
necessarily the right incentives to do

1010
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
what's profit maximizing for the

1011
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,440
owners so here's the example I like to

1012
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,640
use okay imagine you're a corporate

1013
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,359
manager and this is a world you may be

1014
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,720
in someday but imagine you're a

1015
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,440
corporate manager at a pretty big but

1016
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,920
not massive company it's big enough that

1017
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,119
you don't yet have a private jet but all

1018
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,240
your buddies the bigger companies have

1019
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,560
private jets and they rag on you

1020
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,520
mercilessly like you ler you don't have

1021
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,960
a private jet You're Nobody da D D D D

1022
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,560
okay so you're like I need a private jet

1023
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,319
the problem is you've done the math and

1024
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,640
it's not economical of a private J you

1025
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:05,079
can fly you can fly first class anywhere

1026
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,040
you need to go for less than a cost set

1027
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,079
of private

1028
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:11,520
jet but you've noticed that if you

1029
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:14,480
change things a little bit so you flew

1030
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,319
only at the busiest times and only most

1031
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,440
expensive Airlines and you did the math

1032
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,839
then the cost of flying commercial would

1033
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,319
be more than the cost of private jet so

1034
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:24,480
you make a PowerPoint for your board you

1035
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:27,440
make a PowerPoint and you show the

1036
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,440
owners look we could save money by

1037
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,839
private jet now the owners could take

1038
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,640
the time to reverse engineer your

1039
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:34,160
calculations and figure out that you

1040
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,560
cook them a little bit but they're not

1041
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,839
going to they're a bunch of disembodied

1042
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,400
people owning tons of stocks they're not

1043
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,680
going to take the time so like yeah you

1044
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,560
make sense get a private jet and now you

1045
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,560
can hold your head up high with your

1046
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,680
buddies because you got your private jet

1047
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,040
that is not profit maximizing profit

1048
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,839
maximizing was to fly commercial but

1049
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:54,000
it's what made you happiest as the

1050
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:56,680
manager what makes the manager best off

1051
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,480
is not necessarily what makes the profit

1052
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,200
the highest

1053
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,400
and in that

1054
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,680
situation you can end up with profits

1055
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,520
not being

1056
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,119
maximized now it's firms recognize this

1057
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,480
and they set up something to deal with

1058
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,280
this they have something called a board

1059
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,720
of

1060
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:17,480
directors board of directors what the

1061
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,680
board of directors are it's a set of

1062
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,040
representative of the shareholders that

1063
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,319
keep an eye the idea is look you've got

1064
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,359
millions of shareholders in a company

1065
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,800
you got this manager so the million

1066
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:31,760
share company a set of 20ish people who

1067
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,319
keep an eye on the manager they should

1068
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,800
be doing the calculations they should be

1069
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:36,079
watching it to make sure the manager is

1070
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,520
serving their

1071
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,640
interest the problem is Boards of

1072
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,079
directors just don't do a good job

1073
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,720
they're L be why because the people on

1074
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:45,599
the board of directors is largely chosen

1075
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,599
by the

1076
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,720
managers and it's just their corporate

1077
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,040
buddies it's a lot of retired CEOs who

1078
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,079
liked having private jets and think you

1079
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,640
should have one

1080
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,040
too okay so board of directors doesn't

1081
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,200
end up doing necessarily what they

1082
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:01,640
should a great examp example was um

1083
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,520
Richard Grasso was a great American

1084
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,599
success story he went from working in

1085
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,319
the shipping department at the New York

1086
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,680
Stock Exchange to running the entire New

1087
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:11,720
York Stock

1088
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:14,359
Exchange great success story when he

1089
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:17,839
retired there was a lot of controversy

1090
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:21,359
because he got $187 million as a

1091
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:22,760
retirement package it's pretty good okay

1092
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,079
and there was a lot of press about

1093
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,440
that's outrageous and they went to the

1094
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:29,000
board director Bo director said we had

1095
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,520
no idea we were just told it was this

1096
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,440
retirement package with a bunch of

1097
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,319
options and stock pieces and stuff like

1098
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,599
that it looked pretty good to us we

1099
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,280
couldn't unpack it we no idea to have

1100
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,160
$187

1101
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,880
million okay because it's in the manager

1102
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,720
incentive it's his whole life's work to

1103
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,920
maximize his happiness the board of

1104
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,400
directors it's something they're doing

1105
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,160
part-time while they go play Golf the

1106
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,119
other times okay so at the end of the

1107
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,079
day the separation of ownership and

1108
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:58,359
control is real and costly and it means

1109
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:02,000
that firms might not not be doing things

1110
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:03,319
to maximize profits and that's LED once

1111
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,480
again the whole point of this course is

1112
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:06,760
to sort of not solve all your problems

1113
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,400
economic problems but to peque your

1114
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,960
interest in the field this has led to a

1115
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,880
huge part of the field of what's called

1116
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,640
Corporate Finance which is how do you

1117
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:18,839
set up

1118
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:22,359
contracts to align the

1119
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:24,520
incentives of owners and employes this

1120
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:27,280
led for example to the birth to the

1121
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,119
revolution in stock options many many of

1122
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,920
you will know about stock options you're

1123
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,960
hopefully hoping to get them from your

1124
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,200
company you go to the idea is that when

1125
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,440
you get hired they'd only pay you in

1126
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,800
cash they give you some stock and what's

1127
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,119
the idea of stock options it's not

1128
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,200
actually stock what they do is they give

1129
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:45,680
you what's called an option which means

1130
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:49,319
that you have the right to buy the stock

1131
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,640
at today's price or at some strike price

1132
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,839
why is that valuable well it's valuable

1133
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,200
because the stock goes up then you can

1134
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:56,400
buy it at today's price and sell it at

1135
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,960
some future higher price so a stock

1136
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,720
option the idea is it's something which

1137
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,240
is worthless to you if the stock value

1138
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,559
goes down but valuable if the stock

1139
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,760
price goes up so let say you go to

1140
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:06,760
workday for a company where the stock

1141
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,680
value is 100 they say we're going to

1142
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,200
allow you to buy a th shares at 100 if

1143
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,599
the stock price goes up to 200 you buy

1144
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,920
those thousand shares for 100 and sell

1145
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,240
them for 200 you just made

1146
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,000
$100,000 and the idea is well that will

1147
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,839
give managers the

1148
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,200
incentive to raise the value of the

1149
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:27,960
company that will align the incentives

1150
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,319
and that's why they became so popular

1151
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,160
the problem is they've led to disasters

1152
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:35,640
and they've led to disasters because of

1153
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,960
the exact kind of accounting discussion

1154
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:41,119
I was having a few moments ago which is

1155
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,880
that managers can do actions which raise

1156
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,160
the short-term stock price but aren't

1157
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,400
necess in the long-term interest of

1158
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,880
profitability of the

1159
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:52,079
company okay and this the classic

1160
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,280
example of that was the company Enron

1161
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,319
which went bankrupt when you were young

1162
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,760
okay Enron basically a bunch of managers

1163
00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:01,720
a bunch of stock options what they did

1164
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:04,079
is essentially set up a Ponzi scheme

1165
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,119
where they had Enron sell its

1166
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,720
subsidiaries they had Enron sell an

1167
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:10,000
unnamed subsidary that was also owned by

1168
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,839
Enron a good and it looked like Enron

1169
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,839
was booking big sales but of course

1170
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,400
Enron was also booking the purchases but

1171
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:17,319
it was all the sum of the subsidiary and

1172
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,240
Enron stock price went through the roof

1173
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:21,640
and these guys got super rich and tried

1174
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,200
to run away from the company some did

1175
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,599
some got out but some didn't the company

1176
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,520
went it got exposed and the company went

1177
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:28,359
bankrupt and but you know I don't think

1178
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:32,200
any went to jail some of them got

1179
00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:33,720
penalized a lot okay so basically the

1180
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,319
problem with stock options is they work

1181
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:39,040
in theory in principle they can lead to

1182
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,559
even more bad behavior which you can end

1183
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,119
up with people trying to then go further

1184
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:46,079
to try to manipulate the stock price to

1185
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:49,000
maximize their income the point is that

1186
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,760
this is a very hard and fascinating

1187
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:55,040
Enterprise and there's always room for

1188
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,520
thinking creatively about how do

1189
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,720
you align the interest

1190
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,000
I even talked about the interest of the

1191
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,800
workers we're only talking about the

1192
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,520
interest of you know one rich guy versus

1193
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,559
another rich guy okay there's also the

1194
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,839
interest of the workers and how do we

1195
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:08,440
think about contracts that also bring in

1196
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:10,720
the interest of the workers is another

1197
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,359
interesting question it's a fascinating

1198
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,640
area and one which you can learn more

1199
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:15,839
about if if you study the field of of

1200
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:19,040
corporate finance and think more about

1201
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:23,040
those areas okay questions about

1202
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:25,119
that all right let's stop there um and

1203
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,880
uh go see our Kel's tomorrow night and

1204
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,880
I'll see you guys in class on Wednesday

1205
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,880
okay
