1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,711
In Mexico, I just have one sister. Here,

2
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,129
I have 30 sisters.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,049
Coming here

4
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:13,763
and found these amazing women, amazing sisters,

5
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:17,058
has been very critical in my journey.

6
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:22,063
It’s a privilege to be surrounded by such an amazing group of people.

7
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:24,899
I felt much more alone before coming here.

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,736
And then when I met my female cohort, I felt,

9
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,612
“oh, wow, I'm not alone.”

10
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:33,408
Everybody has their own battles to fight.

11
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,661
And, you know, and it's not easy to get to where they are.

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,622
Usually,

13
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,791
you don't have

14
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,252
that example

15
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,379
that it's easy to relate to.

16
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,926
So these networks of women
helping women are very important.

17
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:55,180
The women in our cohort, I think they are,

18
00:00:55,472 --> 00:01:00,435
in every dimension, unique and brilliant.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,603
They are brave.

20
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,729
Very diverse.

21
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,106
And I think that's what makes us powerful.

22
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,942
Has like a lot of effort.

23
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:12,405
Extra effort. Has to be comparing to men.

24
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,656
I'm sorry to say that.

25
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,450
Interviewer: “Oh no, I take no offense.”

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,159
Smart and

27
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,996
funny and amazing and has done
so much in her life

28
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:24,542
and in her career that I'm just in
awe of, of all of them.

29
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,087
Kind of hard to articulate
what words to use.

30
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,173
They each have their story
and such a diverse background.

31
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,718
that when you hear them, it just really moves you and inspires you.

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,762
I remember

33
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,765
them telling us, like,

34
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,227
you are going to learn so much from your peers.

35
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:47,440
More than from professors or other people.

36
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:50,110
I was like,

37
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,779
okay, but like

38
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,864
we are all kind of the same.

39
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,366
But after some time

40
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,868
I was admiring so much

41
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:03,873
my friends, I never imagined
that I would admire so much

42
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,209
my peers.

43
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:13,299
You get examples of incredible leaders who are very humane, like really good people.

44
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:17,345
You're going to have people that come from like a science background,

45
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:23,852
military background, social sciences or entrepreneur background,

46
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:29,774
but all of them are really committed
to doing things better.

47
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,278
I just saw how everybody is committed

48
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,406
with ambitions,

49
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:42,203
with their desires to make an impact in the world.

50
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:46,124
So that's very powerful. The vibe is different

51
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,542
when you consider that.

52
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,461
People told me that this is a very collaborative place.

53
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:55,133
I didn’t really believe at the beginning, to be honest because I always

54
00:02:55,133 --> 00:03:02,098
heard stories about those great MBA classes and schools where people are competing with each other.

55
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,268
At Sloan Fellows, it’s so different. It’s completely the opposite.

56
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,269
I love it.

57
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,899
There's a camaraderie of women
that are all strong women

58
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:16,154
who have really good careers and who want
to make a good impact in the world.

59
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,781
And we are working together as a group.

60
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:24,954
It's really important not just to have
them, but to have them for everything.

61
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,458
We have a logo that is “No Fellow Left Behind.”

62
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,920
And we do work with that.

63
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,217
We have an amazing woman in our program that graduated in economics

64
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:42,263
and she gave extra classes to help us with the exam.

65
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,641
You are safe to experiment anything.

66
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:48,394
You are safe to open up.

67
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,189
You are safe to say exactly how you feel.

68
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,358
We do cry sometimes.

69
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:57,779
And it’s impressive, like if one day you are down

70
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:05,495
there is a list of many names you can call just to come and help you and comfort you and hear you.

71
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,246
Many of us

72
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,458
come in to the program as
a blank sheet of paper.

73
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:14,587
That helped me to build the community of trust

74
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,509
so we can always rely on each other,
being able to share,

75
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,054
you know, what we are going through.

76
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,557
Either it's like the pressure from family.

77
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,978
“Why are you doing this?” Still when you're adapting to the new life.

78
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,899
Being a mid-career professional
a lot of the time means you have a spouse

79
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,733
and you have a family

80
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,988
and for woman, even in 2023
or 2024

81
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:45,868
for a woman to be the one
to take her family through this shift,

82
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,871
especially if they're not from the U.S.
and not from Boston,

83
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,292
and most of the program
isn't because we're super international.

84
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,087
Taking the family through that shift,
being a woman is still something

85
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,382
that is not very common and not

86
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,259
not a lot

87
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,262
of societies and not a lot of,
communities will accept that.

88
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,098
Everybody was very courageous

89
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:11,436
and has to be courageous for everyone
to actually pause their career.

90
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,855
Say no to the promotion.

91
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,983
For a woman to come here, for a mid-career
woman to come here,

92
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,737
there are so many hurdles
she had to go through in her life.

93
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:25,241
There was a moment of time
that people experienced doubts.

94
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,368
“Am I doing the right thing?”

95
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:31,539
You know, “would I be able
to continue my progression when I go back?”

96
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,752
“Would I be able to pivot to
to where I want to go?”

97
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,920
So we support each other by that.

98
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,173
We bounce ideas off each other.

99
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,969
One of the things that I've appreciated
the most was to hear,

100
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,265
to experience the

101
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:54,562
background, the culture, the perspective
of so many different people.

102
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,025
And that gives you a different awareness
about where you are,

103
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,151
about what you do.

104
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:04,072
We need to surround ourselves with people that our actually going to bring us

105
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,074
forward and not backwards.

106
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,369
So that was something I learned in the program.

107
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,622
As we share, we are learning.

108
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,791
We are learning from each other.

109
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:19,462
We are learning
from completely different experiences.

110
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:24,425
Very diverse industries,
very diverse type of lifestyles.

111
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,970
But at the same time
we share meaningful stories

112
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,722
of the way we see life.

113
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:34,936
Sometimes I think we we make up excuses
to have coffee together,

114
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,607
just to have those type of conversations
and laugh about ourselves.

115
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,275
I think about Victoria
and I think about Diana.

116
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,110
I think about Victoria
and I think about Diana.

117
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:46,447
When I look at them, you know,
they really inspire me to want to be

118
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,993
better and, you know, see life
like they see it from their point of view.

119
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,955
They motivate me
and they bring that youthfulness

120
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,958
type of energy out of me
when I'm around them.

121
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:02,422
And they have really just pushed me to
like, for example, today I went sailing.

122
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,840
I've never done sailing in my life.

123
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,841
So they both took me in.

124
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,927
They were like, Erika, you cannot be in
Boston and not do sailing.

125
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,972
I probably would have never done it
on my own just because,

126
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,640
hey, it's not a priority for me,

127
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,561
but, doing it with them
just brought so much more meaning to it.

128
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:21,566
we like us so much that you're
trying stuff different just because

129
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,404
we want to get closer or we want to...

130
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,865
we want to know better each other.

131
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,535
And you're doing stuff
that you are not going to do by yourself.

132
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,663
When you see your peers, alumni,

133
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,500
the people that came before you
and you see all the incredible

134
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,254
accomplishments that they've done,
it makes you feel very good about yourself.

135
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:47,216
Like, oh, I'm in, this is a nice club.

136
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:53,222
but also, it makes me think that this is a tool

137
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,183
that I can use to create impact.

138
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,477
Whenever you have the opportunity

139
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,149
to get to other networks, scopes

140
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,234
greater or bigger than the ones

141
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:10,156
that you have previously experience,
go for them because you don't know

142
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:14,327
how they are going to affect you,
but they will change you, for sure.
