00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,200
Hi everyone. I'm Sarah Remson, the CEO

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,360
and co-founder of Melody, and we help

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,599
companies understand how well their

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,880
agentic AI conversations are actually

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,480
going. I graduated from MIT in a program

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,800
called the integrated design and

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,320
management uh program, and I'm putting a

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,080
lot of my human center design background

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,720
and technical expertise into this

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,039
product. So, one of the things that you

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,040
may notice as you interact with a bunch

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,719
of different types of AI agents is that

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,239
you now have this new conversation

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,480
interface, which is really exciting

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,800
because it opens up totally new

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,239
opportunities for use cases and ways of

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,680
applying this so that you can do things

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,480
that you've never been able to do

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,480
before. But this also introduces a ton

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,039
of new challenges when it comes to

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,239
actually monitoring and understanding

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,360
the performance of those AI

23
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,920
conversations. Not just from a technical

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,640
standpoint of latency and cost and

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,399
tokens, but actually is this answer

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,080
relevant? Is this working for your

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,159
customer? And part of the challenge

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,720
there is that while these conversations

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,720
all seem like they are different, they

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,400
might actually be the same. And so it

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,320
can be really challenging to understand

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,400
this unstructured conversation data.

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,240
What are your users doing? Are they

34
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,479
having success? And so we see teams

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,400
reaching for data scientists and doing a

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,119
ton of manual analysis to just get that

37
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,439
picture. So this is the problem that

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,119
Melody solves automatically. We have our

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,280
own proprietary model that we run

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,040
inhouse and essentially for our

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,280
customers, we look at all of the

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,520
conversations that your customers or

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,439
your users are having with an assistant

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,840
that you have built. So, we're LLM

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,799
agnostic or AI agnostic. We just need

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,200
the transcripts and we analyze and

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,200
identify the places where conversations

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,799
are going really well and places where

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,320
conversations may not be going really

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,479
well. And we provide specific

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,000
recommendations for you about things

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,759
that you could do on your team to

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
actually improve those. So, we heard a

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,759
lot about source documentation as a key

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,280
part of a lot of AI systems today.

56
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,040
That's one of the first places that our

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,960
customers reach for. So we can

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,080
automatically identify for example like

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,080
you should update your source

60
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,239
documentation when your users from your

61
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,680
northeast region ask about billing

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,000
because those are the conversations that

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,680
are struggling the most. So, uh, and

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,400
like just one more thing on our on the

65
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,400
tech side of things. Um, my co-founder

66
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,920
used to lead AI at HubSpot and built

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,280
their conversation intelligence product.

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,120
And so, we're leveraging a lot of that

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,760
technical expertise in order to deliver

70
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,160
a solution that's very low cost, um,

71
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,080
very fast and has delivered a ton of

72
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,319
great results for our existing

73
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,519
customers. So, you know, the types of

74
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,280
things that we're seeing, we're working

75
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,599
with a bunch of publicly traded

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,840
companies. We're five times cheaper than

77
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,920
hiring a data scientist, 30 times faster

78
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,400
than doing manual analysis. Our

79
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,640
customers love us. And the specific use

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,120
cases that our customers are often

81
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,680
working on are things like an AI powered

82
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,599
product or feature, their own internal

83
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,400
work, like their own internal assistant

84
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,480
for knowledge management or for sales or

85
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,920
for customer success. And so we're able

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,840
to provide those metrics and um AI

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,360
identified issues to help them actually

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,239
improve those models and deliver on the

89
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,000
ROI that uh that they need to. So we um

90
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,360
are looking to connect with folks if

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
you're building any of these AI

92
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,720
assistants or AI agents inhouse. If

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
you're looking for a new type of

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,680
analytics tool um or if you're thinking

95
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,120
about expanding your offerings uh and

96
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,640
extending them, we're also looking for

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,959
partners. I should also add we're

98
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,720
industry agnostic. The key thing here is

99
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,920
that you are building these AI agents or

100
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:42,640
assistants in house. So thank you.

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,560
So do you take the uh ground truth from

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,040
customers to validate and also how do

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,959
you compare with tools like lang etc for

104
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,920
the validation? Yep. So tools like

105
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,599
Langmith are perfect for teams that

106
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,360
really care about the engineering

107
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,280
metrics again like latency and things

108
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,040
like that. So pretty much all of our

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,319
customers often choose a platform like

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,920
that first and then they realize that

111
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,920
they need Melody for those like product

112
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,920
and operations teams to actually report

113
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,239
ROI that's relative to the customers

114
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,480
like are the customers having success.

115
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,319
So we sit on top of a link or someone

116
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,040
else like that and then in terms of how

117
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,600
our tech actually works we um we look at

118
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,040
an initial sample of conversations. We

119
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,840
look at all of the ones that have

120
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,759
feedback from external users or internal

121
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,520
users and we use that to effectively

122
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,919
like calibrate our model according to

123
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,520
like what is good like what where a

124
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,600
conversation is successful and where a

125
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,960
conversation is not successful that we

126
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,080
can then extrapolate onto new

127
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,080
conversations and it's customized to

128
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,560
every user or sorry every customer and

129
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,560
every use case.
