1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,320
So we have to move on to our last

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,400
speaker in this session and that is way

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,280
who is assistant professor at the center

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,880
for genomic mechanisms of Massachusetts.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,199
Oh sorry genomic medicine of

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,600
Massachusetts general hospital and

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,199
Harvard medical school and associate

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,000
member of the Stanley Center for

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,400
Psychiatric Research Broad Institute of

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,720
Mid and Howard. Thank you very much for

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,160
the introduction and uh sorry I can't

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,480
can't be there due to co and um I'm

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,880
really grateful for the opportunity uh

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,879
to talk about our recent work that we

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,160
try to tackle some challenges when we

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,040
map genetic effects for highdimensional

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,000
molecular phenotypes at a single cell

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,559
resolution. So in this talk I'm going to

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,160
talk about uh EQL in the context of

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,559
single cell RNA sick and our work has um

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,840
can can be easily extended to other

22
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,920
molecular phenotypes. Um so uh

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,840
population scale single cell RNA

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,640
sequencing technology uh has helped us

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,439
uh to improve the EQL mapping by

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,320
connecting the uh genotypes to gene

27
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,240
expression at cell resolution. As you

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,720
can see, we can combine different cell

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,759
context to understand the genetic

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,320
regulation on gene expression at a

31
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,159
higher resolution. And then in the past

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,640
several years, there are more and more

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,880
single cell EQL studies have been

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,240
published. So as we can tell from this

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,680
plot, the y-axis axis shows the number

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,720
of individuals in each study and the uh

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,520
size of each dot uh reflects the average

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,880
number of cells per individual in those

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,960
studies. And the dot up here is the 1K1K

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,399
study published in 2022 and in which on

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,520
average 1,00 immune cells uh from each

42
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,159
of the 10,000 individuals have been sequ

43
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,680
RNA sequenced for the gene expression

44
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:07,280
and these cells um can be grouped to uh

45
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,319
14 different uh immune cell groups cell

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,920
types. Uh so as we see that the data

47
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,599
sizes are rapidly increasing and this

48
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,120
year we can see fingen has uh sequenced

49
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,959
uh one 10 million single nuclei from

50
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,840
more than 1100 uh blood donors and which

51
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:32,000
increases the uh number of cells per

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,959
donor by 10 times more and the um the

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,080
10k 10k study which is the next step of

54
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,879
1k1k and in their first phase

55
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,640
um published uh this year and they

56
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:48,080
sequenced 5 million PBMC's from uh close

57
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,840
to 2,000 donors which uh further

58
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,080
improves the number of donors by twice.

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,000
So as we can see that although this

60
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,800
large amount of single cell RNA

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,760
sequencing data are becoming available

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,280
and typically and we still need to

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,640
harmonize um and aggregate those cell

64
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,239
level read counts to donor level uh as

65
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,959
some metrics such as some mean or medium

66
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,239
across all cells per each donor. So we

67
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,720
can use existing EQL mapping tools uh

68
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,360
for the genetic mapping uh which leads

69
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,080
to several limitations and I'm listing

70
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,400
two of them here. The first one we uh

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,920
actually ignores the whole spectrum of

72
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,239
readouts from cells. Uh instead we just

73
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,360
use the single value and ignore the

74
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,000
share structure and uh variations across

75
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,560
cells. Uh this can lead to reduced the

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,400
power. And then second one we uh treat

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:50,000
all the cells um as identical repeats

78
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,920
and then we um just to simply ignore the

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
cell context and different cell

80
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,120
annotations and then lose the

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,159
opportunity to uh detect those genetic

82
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,920
regulations which can be heterogeneous

83
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,319
and we call dynamic EQL effects. So in

84
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,840
today's talk and I'm going to go through

85
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,799
two uh recent methods we have developed

86
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,200
to tackle those different uh limitations

87
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,320
and then I'm going to go uh also

88
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,560
introduce this really uh exciting study

89
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,160
conducted by Molina's group uh which

90
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,680
generates uh human ado edocide village

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,759
with different stimulation applied uh to

92
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,880
provide really fantastic opportunities

93
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,520
for us to uh ask which disease risk

94
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,880
relevant variants are linked to cell

95
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,240
state and stimulation or donor level uh

96
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,960
context EQL map EQL.

97
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,000
Um so there are several challenges when

98
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,560
we try to map EQTLs at single cell

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,600
resolution and the first one is we need

100
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,160
to uh directly model those read counts

101
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,199
from uh cell level. So we need to model

102
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,800
repeat and complex data structure and

103
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,280
then we cannot simply assume um they uh

104
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,000
follow normal distribution as we can uh

105
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,400
see that most of the genes their read

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,440
counts actually are quite scaled and

107
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,759
they are uh discrete read counts

108
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,160
and then as the data size are

109
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,960
continuously growing and we need a

110
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,600
really fast and scalable tools to be

111
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,639
able to analyze those uh single cell RNA

112
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,440
sick data and And the last one is um as

113
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,919
the number of donors have been increased

114
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,639
in these studies uh which allow us to

115
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,000
detect those rare and less frequent

116
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,320
genetic variations uh for EQL mapping

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,759
which have been largely underststudied

118
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,400
in previous studies and the uh single

119
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,720
variant test is underpowered for those

120
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,840
genetic variations. So we need to have

121
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,639
efficient approach to analyze them and

122
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,600
uh there are some pioneer work uh try to

123
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,680
detect eqls and also context dependent

124
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,000
eqls at a single cell on a sick data and

125
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,000
uh as we can see they have successfully

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,400
identify uh eqls u by directly modeling

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,800
read counts and while suffering from

128
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,280
different limitations and the shared

129
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,319
limitation they have is they are not

130
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,319
efficient enough. So usually um they

131
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,960
need some hierarchical approach to

132
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,680
conduct the analysis

133
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,479
and um so as we given those different

134
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,479
challenges I've described and there's no

135
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,919
scalable and efficient computational

136
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,240
tools uh exist to handle all of those

137
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,960
challenges simultaneously for us to

138
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,400
conduct EQTL mapping using single cell

139
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,720
RNA sick uh which motivates uh our work.

140
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,280
So if we take a another look at those

141
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,440
challenges, we realize that they

142
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,720
actually uh they're actually quite

143
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,600
similar to those we observed in in GIW

144
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,319
was for human disease and traits when we

145
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,120
analyze large scale bio banks and for

146
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,960
example in GW was we need to model uh

147
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,680
population substructure sample

148
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,400
relatedness between individuals and uh

149
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,639
we uh when we when the traits are not

150
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,800
continuous traits and we need to model

151
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,160
those binary phenotypes

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,199
uh countbased phenotypes and then as the

153
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,440
uh bio bank size keep growing and the

154
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,319
scalability and efficiency is also a

155
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,199
challenge for the G-W was tools and uh

156
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,080
for rare variations actually GW was

157
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,800
field has has grows really uh maturely

158
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,360
and we have investigated those uh rare

159
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,199
var r v r v r v r v r v r v r v r v r v

160
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,280
r v raration associations with human

161
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,680
disease and trace uh substantially. So

162
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,639
uh based on these similarities and uh

163
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,759
given that our previous work uh to

164
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,240
develop a suit of tools for tackling

165
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,400
similar challenges and testing common

166
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,800
and rare variations for human disease

167
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,599
and traits in large bio banks and we

168
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,520
decide to leverage this uh efficient and

169
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:05,039
scalable tool infrastructure and to uh

170
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,440
apply them to uh EQL mapping. So and

171
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,919
then we uh our first tool is called Sage

172
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,520
QTL and which is leveraging the Sage

173
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,240
GWAS tool uh to efficiently mapping EQLS

174
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,160
at a single cell resolution and as we

175
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,639
we're listing here it's a collaborating

176
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,599
work with Anna Kumer who is part of the

177
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,039
1K1K team and we're trying to use

178
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,319
efficient poismics model to model the uh

179
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,039
complex data structure uh and then we uh

180
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,959
leverage some uh approximation and

181
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,080
computation approaches to make it

182
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,080
scalable and then we uh try to use the

183
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,519
setbased test which has been commonly

184
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,080
used for uh human disease and traits and

185
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,480
to uh group rare variations based on

186
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,880
functional units and testing them uh

187
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,360
together. So for the sake of time I'm

188
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,560
not going to go to those math details of

189
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:00,000
our tool and we have used um three

190
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,880
representative cell types in 1k1k across

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,080
different uh cell type abundance levels

192
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,120
to show that sageql has well calibrated

193
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,160
false discovery rates. And then these

194
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,080
are the benchmark we have when we try to

195
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:20,959
analyze uh 1K1K data. As we can see to

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,920
analyze all 14 cell types and uh if we

197
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,680
we want analyze all 20,000 genes in each

198
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,800
cell type and you can uh you can use 200

199
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,080
CPUs and finish the work in one day. And

200
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,120
then um due to the reduce of the uh

201
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,040
overhead in reading genotypes and if you

202
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,600
want to uh do the trans eql mapping for

203
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,080
all genes and which means you uh conduct

204
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,440
a genome wise scan for 8 million genetic

205
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,560
markers for each of the 20,000 genes and

206
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,360
uh an extra hundreds of CPU hours is

207
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,080
needed and I think the computation cost

208
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,880
uh here uh is not a bottleneck and the

209
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:06,080
bottleneck here is how do we efficiently

210
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,640
store uh those um 20,000 time 14 uh G-W

211
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,760
was summary statistics

212
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,240
and then as expected we have observed by

213
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,920
directly modeling single cell read

214
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:22,079
counts and our tool can identify uh

215
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,880
about 48% more ees than the pseudo bulk

216
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,160
approach using tensor QTL so the

217
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,480
improvement is uh across all cell types

218
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,120
and we can also observe that number of E

219
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,560
genes increases as number of cells

220
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,279
increases with both methods.

221
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,560
And uh based on these vin diagrams of

222
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:46,079
the E genes identified by two methods

223
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,360
and we can see uh SQTR has successfully

224
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,399
identify those uh E genes that identify

225
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,880
by pseudobul approach with additional

226
00:10:52,399 --> 00:11:00,399
ees identified. Um so uh for example in

227
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:04,800
the monocytes and this is a locus um

228
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:07,839
from the G-W was for IBD and uh as we

229
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,120
can see when the top the locosis plot on

230
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,760
the top shows the results from sage QTL

231
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,480
and then the uh top the plot on the

232
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,519
bottom is from the tensor QTL. So we can

233
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,160
see uh by um conducting EQL at a single

234
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,519
cell resolution we can successfully

235
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,600
identify this uh this EQTL uh which has

236
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,000
been missed by the pseudo bug which

237
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,160
didn't really pass the significant

238
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,560
cutoff and then uh this EQL is actually

239
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,240
monocy specific and which is not

240
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,120
observed in other cell types

241
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,320
and uh so if we take a look at all the E

242
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,480
genes uh identified across 14 cell types

243
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:54,560
and we see that about uh 44% from the

244
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,880
unique E genes are specific to a single

245
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,680
cell type but note that this type of

246
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,640
analysis had this limitation it is it

247
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,519
can be confounded by power unbalance in

248
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,920
different cell types due to uh cell type

249
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,880
abundance

250
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,680
and uh further we have uh uh this

251
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,279
analysis was done by Anglicia from the

252
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:21,440
1K1K group And we try to uh

253
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:24,880
collocicalized our EQL with GWAS summary

254
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,440
statistics and show that uh sage QTL

255
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,160
identify additional immune disease

256
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,720
associated lowi that are immediated by

257
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,560
gene expression

258
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,680
and then uh this heat map pl heat map

259
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,880
and shows the trans eqrl regions that we

260
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,360
identified in the naive CD4 plus T-

261
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,160
cells and the uh vertical ical line

262
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,320
shows the location of the EQTL signals

263
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,279
and the horizontal line shows the genes

264
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,279
that we're we're testing and uh as an

265
00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:00,880
example we can see that uh by uh based

266
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:03,120
on the genome Y scan for uh EQ for the

267
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,440
gene expression and we see that for

268
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,880
these two genes the gene MRPL32

269
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,639
not only has a cis EQL identified but

270
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:19,040
also a trans EQL uh on chromosome 16

271
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:21,760
which is a cisql of another gene spns1.

272
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,040
So it seems these two genes are both

273
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,360
involved in mitochondrial pathways.

274
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,320
And then for rare variations uh we're

275
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,279
trying to group rare variants uh within

276
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,920
each genes and of course we can annotate

277
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,880
them at in different uh in different

278
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,240
ways based on functional units such as

279
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,880
epigenetic features uh pathways and then

280
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,560
we use different setbased tests to

281
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,839
account for uh different scenarios of uh

282
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,320
effect directions and the signal sparity

283
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,959
uh to improve our test power. And then

284
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,440
we identified uh over 5,500 E genes uh

285
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,920
with rare or less frequent variant

286
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,839
signals. And then after conditioning on

287
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:11,279
the nearby common EQLs, 21% of them

288
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:15,120
remain significant. So that means um

289
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:18,160
they can uh contain know independent EQL

290
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,639
signals u that are uh different from the

291
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,040
common EQLs.

292
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,440
And then uh Lingong Hu who is a very

293
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,279
talented uh associate computational

294
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:33,839
biologist abroad and conducted the more

295
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:36,240
uh analysis uh try to comb apply uh sql

296
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,040
in different data sets and one is

297
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,519
another PBMC uh data set and then the

298
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,519
other one is the retino data sets and

299
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,320
both of them have relatively smaller

300
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,120
sample size u which with around 100

301
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,800
donors but uh we have successfully seen

302
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,920
the um better performance of Sage QTL

303
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,480
over the pseudo bulk approach. And then

304
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,240
uh more recently uh we have successfully

305
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,199
applied sqdl to 10k 10k and finen which

306
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,920
are the two of the largest data sets

307
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:11,519
from the single cell RNA sick. So we

308
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,720
have made this uh tool an open-source R

309
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,920
package and people can apply and then

310
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,399
given the this this work that we show um

311
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,000
the better performance uh to detect

312
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,199
EQTLs when we model single uh single

313
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,920
cells um directly instead of pseudob

314
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,000
them and um we still see those

315
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,959
challenges because uh you know limited

316
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,320
overlap has been observed between GW was

317
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,519
loi and eqls There have uh different

318
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,680
there there have been different

319
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,199
hypothesis to explain this limited

320
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,920
overlap and one possibility is the um

321
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,480
context dependent EQL which means

322
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,759
probably uh the EQLs that are more

323
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,360
relevant to GW was or human disease uh

324
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,600
can only be observed in certain context.

325
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,639
uh for example uh the the cell level

326
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,000
context can include uh cell types and

327
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,399
cell uh transition differentiation and

328
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,959
different cell states

329
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,920
and uh again the pioneer work has uh

330
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,720
tried to uh identify those context

331
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,519
dependent EQLs and for example the

332
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,639
Nathan at all uh study has successfully

333
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:26,959
identified the dynamic T- cell state

334
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,120
dependence um uh EQLS uh that

335
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,160
the collocicalized with the disease

336
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,040
lossi and um and then again these

337
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,399
methods uh still suffer the efficiency

338
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,279
issue. So uh they usually require to uh

339
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,480
first scan the main effects eqls and

340
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:47,279
then uh only conduct try to conduct

341
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,880
context dependent eqls for those uh

342
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:53,360
significant main uh genotype eqls which

343
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,560
can make some signals that we can see

344
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,360
from the uh later slides. And so and

345
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,240
then given this this uh challenge and we

346
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,559
decide to extend our sage QTL framework

347
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,760
to uh detect those uh context

348
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:13,439
dependent eqls. We called it sageql

349
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,160
dynamic which is uh led by uh the

350
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,240
another talent um associate

351
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,640
computational biologist uh Cristiana

352
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,559
Louu and then uh together with Anna

353
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,240
Kumer. So um I'm going to uh go through

354
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,520
really quickly about the details.

355
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,080
Basically we try to model the uh context

356
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,600
dependent eqls at the interaction term

357
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,160
of genotype with the context while uh

358
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,880
accounting for the different gene

359
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,840
expression levels due to context uh

360
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,160
values uh through the fixed effects and

361
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,640
also random effects in our posom mix

362
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,039
model. And then we also try to combine

363
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,360
different uh uh context dependent

364
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:57,360
signals using a variance component based

365
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,280
test scat test to so uh some users if

366
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,480
they require and then then they can

367
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:06,080
reduce the testing burden. And then in

368
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,799
1K 1K B cells experiment and we uh try

369
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,280
to analyze two different B cell subtypes

370
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,000
and we include the donor level context

371
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,160
age and gender and cell level context

372
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,559
pseudo time which measure the cell

373
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,840
transition from B naive cells to B

374
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:25,360
memory cells and then uh the cell cycle

375
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,799
score which measure uh the cell cycle

376
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,720
stage of of of each cell and these are

377
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,559
uh different QQ plots from different

378
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,720
tests uh for uh G by different context

379
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,960
and then also the main G effects and

380
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,760
also the scat test which combined all

381
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,160
the effects together. So uh if we take a

382
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,960
look at the main effects and of course

383
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,240
as expected and we can see uh when we

384
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,880
analyze all uh the two different B cell

385
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,200
types together we're able to identify

386
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,039
more uh EQLS simply based on the main

387
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,240
effects

388
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,880
and uh if we take a look at the G by

389
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,160
cell cycle score and this is the E genes

390
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,679
we identified uh with uh that shows the

391
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,679
significant

392
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:16,320
uh cell cycle dependent EQLs and then on

393
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,440
the left we can see uh the alilic

394
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,720
effects actually changes um across

395
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,840
different sores and then as a checkup

396
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,080
and we uh plot the total read counts of

397
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,280
that gene to show that uh this

398
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,679
observation is not uh this this uh

399
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,320
context dependent eql is not uh

400
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,360
confounded by different gene expression

401
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,000
levels uh across s scores and appar

402
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,360
Apparently this gene is uh its function

403
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,799
has uh is really tightly related to uh

404
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:52,160
the S phase of the cell cycle u to

405
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:56,160
ensure accurate uh DNA replication. And

406
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,320
another check is the G by s pseudo time

407
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,760
uh which measures the transition from

408
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,520
naive B cells to memory B cells. And we

409
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:09,280
have seen that there are 25 uh E genes

410
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:12,480
when we test uh this context. And then

411
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:17,360
uh as you can see some of them are not

412
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:20,880
uh detect by uh if you by the main uh

413
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:24,240
genotype effects and uh as one example

414
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,720
the need one gene uh which is uh has a

415
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,360
really close function relationship with

416
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,679
the immunereated disease. As you can see

417
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,320
the p value for the main G effects is

418
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,960
not significant all but we see the uh

419
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,760
significant p values for the pseudo time

420
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,120
by G. And then if you take a closer look

421
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,760
and you can see that actually the EQL

422
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,640
effects has different uh uh effect

423
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,799
directions in two B cell subtypes. And

424
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,360
then when we combine them together and

425
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,240
only test the genotype effects and they

426
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,720
can be cancelled each other and only be

427
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,000
uh seen when we can when we uh test the

428
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,919
G by pseudo time dynamic EQL.

429
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,640
And then uh those E genes that

430
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,280
identified by both uh genotype and the G

431
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,520
by pseudo time tends to have the similar

432
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,960
uh consistent effect direction but a

433
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,440
different magnitude. So um and then I

434
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,080
want to emphasize that uh the you know

435
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,320
the 1K1K data set probably is not the

436
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,280
most ideal data set for us to look at

437
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,000
the dynamic EQLs and fortunately

438
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,200
Molina's group has conducted this study

439
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,720
that uh actually perfectly um matched

440
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,720
our goal which is uh uh let's check the

441
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,960
disease relevant relev risk relevant uh

442
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,240
variants that are linked to different

443
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:49,120
cell state and different uh context uh

444
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:53,360
uh specific um equity mapping. So um

445
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:56,320
this work has been done by uh E and uh

446
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,960
Hin uh from uh Molina's group. If you

447
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,000
want to know more details, please check

448
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,799
uh E's poster uh number 40 uh this

449
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,559
afternoon. And uh so basically our goal

450
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,120
is to uh discover genetic mechanism re

451
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,520
relevant to uh metabolic disease

452
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,000
development in the context of

453
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,840
environmental cues. So as we can see

454
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,000
there can be um different glucose levels

455
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:28,799
and then uh hypoxia and free fatty acid.

456
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:33,200
So uh it has uh selected 118 donors from

457
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:37,200
this cell gem bank and uh then uh apply

458
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,840
four different stimulations to uh the

459
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,960
adipose tissue derived messencho stem

460
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:46,000
cells and then after differentiation and

461
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,039
these cells can be uh differentiated to

462
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,679
two four different cell types and um I

463
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,960
would mention like to mention that this

464
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:59,120
edible side village um is approach is

465
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,840
really costefficient for us to study uh

466
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,080
stimulence dependent EQLs

467
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,600
uh because they can be uh sequenced

468
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,320
together and then uh demultiplex plexed

469
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:14,720
by some uh computational algorithm. So

470
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:17,280
in the end we have uh single nucleotide

471
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,559
uh RNA sequencing coupled with single

472
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,400
nucleotide at tech sequencing from over

473
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,880
uh 300,000

474
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,840
total nuclei

475
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,760
and uh then uh we can see that the four

476
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,720
in the four different cell types and we

477
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,000
can uh have different cell states and

478
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,600
then leverage different stimulations to

479
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,039
apply sageql dynamic and to check uh the

480
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,600
EQTLs from the main genotype and EQTLs

481
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,919
under different stimulations. And these

482
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,600
are our U preliminary results from the

483
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,720
adolesite population. And um this plot

484
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,000
shows the number of E genes we identify

485
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,960
from the main genotypes and also from

486
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,640
the uh different context dependent um

487
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:07,120
EQLs. And uh our main observation is

488
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,840
that uh compared to the sex and age

489
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,640
which are donor level context and our

490
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,720
stimulation dependent uh context

491
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:20,000
actually identify way more uh eqtls than

492
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,000
uh simply uh check the sex and age uh

493
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,480
status

494
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,080
and then uh after collocicalized with

495
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,039
the relevant chiwas and we uh have

496
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,240
successfully observed that the single

497
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:38,240
cell context EQTLs identified by Sage

498
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:41,520
QTL dynamic uh has uh is more uh way way

499
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:45,039
more enriched in in the G-W was losi uh

500
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,840
than the pseudo approach which we try to

501
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,760
uh aggregate cells from each different

502
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,520
simulation and different contexts

503
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,919
together and then test them at at a

504
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,720
donor level.

505
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,440
And uh also we want to mention that

506
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,240
chromatin accessibility QTLs actually

507
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,120
collocicalized with more uh GWA signals

508
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,360
than EQTLs and which is as expected

509
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,559
because there are way more uh genome

510
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,960
region has been checked in the uh CAQTL

511
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,279
mapping than the EQL mapping. And here's

512
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,400
an examp interesting example that shows

513
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:22,000
us the value of uh stimulus dependent

514
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,480
EQLs. So as we can see um when we this

515
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,240
is the GW was locus from the insulin

516
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,440
sensitivity index adjusted BMI and then

517
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,840
uh we if we only check the genotype only

518
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,960
in edible site and we didn't really

519
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,679
observed any EQL signals and then uh the

520
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,960
EQL signal is only observed when we

521
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,679
leverage the low glucose context. So

522
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,520
this EQL collocicalized with G-W was

523
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,480
locus and is low glucose uh dependent

524
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,559
and this gene apparently um has a close

525
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,400
relationship with the uh insulin

526
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,480
sensitivity and advocite

527
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,400
differentiation.

528
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,880
So uh in summary uh we are uh developing

529
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,880
tools and applying the tools and

530
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:11,840
collaborating with Molina's group to uh

531
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,200
uh further exam the context or

532
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,320
stimulation specific EQLs and hopefully

533
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,799
we can identify disease risk variants

534
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,360
that are regulate gene expression under

535
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:26,559
different uh uh environmental

536
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,440
stimulation and context that can be that

537
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,520
can be uh help further explain uh the

538
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,880
G-W was signals that we observed for

539
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,279
different disease end points

540
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,200
and uh I would like to thank all the

541

550
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,200
and ACBs uh for their hard work.

551
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:13,679
Thank you very much um for a very

552
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,120
interesting presentation. I think we

553
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,120
have time just for one question maybe

554
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,120
two

555
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,039
tunas from the University of Copenhagen.

556
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,440
Um yeah thank you for really really for

557
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:32,080
a super inspiring presentation. I was

558
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,919
wondering in terms of um power

559
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,400
calculations can you just give me some

560
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,799
intuition about the number of samples

561
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,320
needed to um do those particular

562
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,559
analyses in the tissues you were

563
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,760
discussing here?

564
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:49,760
>> Yes. So our lowest sample size we have

565
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:53,520
tried is the 80 uh is 90 uh sample 90

566
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:57,760
donors and then uh we uh I think we've

567
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:00,640
try tried tried our approach in uh 50

568
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,960
donors and we still see some improvement

569
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,399
uh but note that uh if we take a look at

570
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,720
a single cell read counts and um many

571
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:11,279
genes have really spar really high

572
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,640
sparity level and we have lots of zeros

573
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,679
in the in the in those vectors. So uh we

574
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:22,000
have have to apply a cutoff that we

575
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:24,880
require uh genes that are expressed in

576
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,440
at least 10% of the donors to conduct

577
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,240
EQR mapping. So I think that that that

578
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,480
standard has been commonly used uh in

579
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,360
our uh days uh single cell analysis uh

580
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,360
studies. Um so uh we need to keep in

581
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,080
keep in mind that uh when we decrease

582
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:47,559
the sample size and we might we might be

583
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,559
able to uh test fewer genes.

584
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,399
>> One last question.

585
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,080
No more questions. I just have one quick

586
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,240
question. So you also look at the the

587
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,720
direction of expression uh with respect

588
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,039
to the rare EQ tails. Can you say

589
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,600
something more general about that? Did

590
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,200
you mostly observe an increased or

591
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,279
decreased expression or how did they

592
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,880
affected the expression in the cell

593
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,960
types?

594
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,640
>> Yeah. Uh that's a great very interesting

595
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,799
question. So uh in our uh main study we

596
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,320
haven't really take a closer look at the

597
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:27,200
effects of the uh rare single rare

598
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,440
variance effects on uh gene expression.

599
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,159
And then uh we so there are different

600
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,919
types of tests we have conducted. Burden

601
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,640
test is simply combine uh the genotypes

602
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:41,679
of the rare variations and scat test

603
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,799
actually uh is more robust to different

604
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:48,080
uh variance uh directions in the testing

605
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,960
set and then later we have um checked

606
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,760
the single variance effect sizes and we

607
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,799
see uh if I remember it correctly most

608
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,919
of them have the decreased uh effect

609
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,840
size uh effects um so they're they tend

610
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,480
to decrease the gene expression

611
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,440
But we need to uh as as we know that

612
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,760
statistically uh the effect the effect

613
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,159
size estimation for rare variance is

614
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,880
quite challenging. So uh to be able to

615
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,840
have a you know solid conclusion we have

616
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,279
to uh make sure our single variant

617
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,799
effect size estimation uh is uh further

618
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,440
uh validated.

619
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:28,240
>> Okay. Thank you. Okay. So I think we

620
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,760
should end by giving applause to all the

621
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,080
three speakers in this session. Thank

622
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,080
you very much.
