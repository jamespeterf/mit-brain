00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,520
Hello. Hi. Hi there. Uh today I'm

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,919
introducing our uh startup Dexmate. So

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,000
we are a AI robotics company who solves

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,000
the physical AI problem. We have three

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,800
co-founders. Uh the CEO Chao is I'm MIT

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,480
SISO aluminina. The COO Chongyang is I'm

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,400
MIT

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,039
and Yuzi I'm the Dexmate CTO.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,599
So physical AI solve a very important

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,160
problems. So in all over the world there

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,239
are 3.2 2 billion people working to

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,399
perform physical labor worldwide and we

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,120
know that in US there are very

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,719
significant labor shortage over the past

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,160
few years. Digital AI like coding agent,

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,120
AI tutor and a lot of other digital

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,840
agent provide 10 times productivity in

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,480
the digital world and the next 10 years

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,600
must belong to the physical AI which can

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:00,440
perform the human labor and change the

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,440
world with 10 times transformations.

22
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,159
The transformation from automation to

23
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,159
physical AI is very low compared with

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,640
traditional automation solutions like

25
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,040
industrial robotics arms. For example,

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,439
if you have a sampling line, you you

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,680
want to change it change it with a with

28
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,840
a conveyor belt

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,320
arm in the traditional fashion, you need

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,280
to change all your all your assembly

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,320
like structure and deploy sensors,

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,119
computations and all at once with six

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,040
months. However, with our physical AI

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,759
solutions, you do not need to change

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,000
your warehouse or factories, you all the

36
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,960
sensors, all the computations powers,

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,439
all the batteries is owned by the robot

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,399
agent and they has the AI capabilities

39
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,960
to adapt to your environment which makes

40
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,439
very little environment modification or

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,159
even zero modification to your

42
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,920
factories.

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,479
In order to make this physical air

44
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,360
possible, we need to have a very strong

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,479
body. In Daxmate, we design and

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,440
manufacture Vea, a humanoid robot

47
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,400
without lag. Compared with traditional

48
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,440
robotic system like Aloha, we have 10 a

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,840
seven times stronger payload and we also

50
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,640
have dextrous manipulating capabilities.

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,120
Compared with the lagged human robot, we

52
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,599
can get three times faster locom motion

53
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,920
and five times longer operation time

54
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,879
than the lag robot.

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,040
We also cares about our user experience.

56
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,280
We make our robot easy to transportation

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,360
with affordable design. With all of

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,519
that, we we are in a painting

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,080
application of 10 and also ready for

60
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,959
mass production. Now,

61
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,760
here is our robot vea as you can see

62
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,800
here. So this is like a uh humanoid on

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,480
the view robot. It can perform a lot of

64
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,160
uh different operations like the view

65
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,160
motion and upper body manipulation.

66
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,200
Here we showcase some of our

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,200
collaboration with our partners in US.

68
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,360
So this is some typical task in

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,080
warehouse and industry. We have

70
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,040
partnered with one of the biggest uh uh

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,760
warehouse company in US

72
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,920
to perform some box flipping tasks and

73
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,400
box moving tasks

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,440
in the in the bottom. So there's like a

75
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,800
box flipping task where you need to make

76
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,680
sure that uh the top of the box is can

77
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,440
be scanned by Q scanner on the assembly

78
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,519
line.

79
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,159
On the upper right, we are also

80
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,159
collaborating with one of the biggest uh

81
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,120
car parts manufacturing company in

82
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:45,080
Europe to uh to perform the car part

83
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,080
placement task.

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So now we are also asking for more

85
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,879
pilots in manufacturing and logistic

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
industries. So we want to working on the

87
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:59,840
task like material handling, box moving,

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,920
part soldering, object uh object

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,159
picking. all this task with our

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,959
partners. So we target at manufacturing

91
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,599
and warehouse applications. So primarily

92
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,000
we focus on United State industry but we

93
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,200
can also do partnership with Europe and

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,840
Japan company. So if you are interested

95
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,720
maybe you can join our uh threeour room

96
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,479
or contact for our email.

97
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,479
Okay. Thank thank you.
