1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,880
awesome well it's great it's great to be

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,120
here thank you for having me uh my name

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,599
is Evan hos I'm co-founder and CEO of

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,679
Helix carbon and I co-founded this

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,600
company actually out of out of MIT like

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,080
like everyone else here and along with

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,119
my co-founders Ariel first who's a

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,800
professor uh in chemical engineering and

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,680
Dave Brown who who was a graduate

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,840
student with me um I was I was a

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,720
graduate student in mechanical

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,240
engineering and also in business and we

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,119
spun this out a lot a lot of the work we

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,879
were doing and sort of around materials

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,920
decarbonization and specifically how do

16
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:40,360
you use electrochemistry to produce

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,239
materials with no carbon impact and

18
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,079
within that we're we're focusing first

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,399
on the Iron and steel industry and this

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,039
is one that you know obviously has a

21
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,440
huge presence here in Japan uh but it

22
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,039
also has a presence globally in terms of

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,079
emissions you know it's roughly 7 to 10%

24
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,359
of global greenhouse gas emissions it's

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,199
a$2 trillion dollar industry and the

26
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,640
vast majority of those emissions come

27
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,799
from the very first step primary iron

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,560
making turning iron ore into metallic

29
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:09,240
iron and if you look at the way this

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,000
process works today those emissions come

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,600
from the fossil fuels that we use as a

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,520
feed stock so those fossil fuels usually

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,880
natural gas or coal are fed into a

34
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,560
reformer that that chemical those

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,680
compounds are converted into carbon

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,119
monoxide and hydrogen which each can

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,439
strip and oxygen off your iron oxide

38
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,520
your iron ore and is emitted as CO2 and

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,240
water

40
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,840
and it is really this CO2 that is the

41
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,439
source of those two gatons of emissions

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,960
globally and the challenge with

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,520
decarbonizing this is these plants these

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,920
furnaces there's about a trillion

45
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,640
dollars of them deployed globally and

46
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,000
many of them have Decades of operating

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,640
life left so how do you decarbonize an

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,159
industry without decarbonizing the

49
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,479
facilities that you already have you

50
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,000
have to develop a technology that is

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,880
compatible with the process that you're

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,159
using and so our answer was instead of

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,280
letting this CO2 get emitted let's

54
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,079
actually close this cycle let's take the

55
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,560
CO2 and water vapor that's being emitted

56
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,239
pull it into our proprietary

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,239
electrochemical cell and Co electroly

58
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,920
the CO2 back into carbon monoxide and

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,640
the water vapor back into hydrogen now

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,040
the the key here is this feed stock is

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,440
chemically identical to what you're

62
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,599
already getting from fossil fuels and so

63
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,280
it's a dropin solution A Drop In

64
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,560
chemical at existing iron making

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,800
facilities

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,760
and at the end of the day you get you

67
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,160
know the same identical sponge iron

68
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,400
product so in order to do this we had to

69
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,599
solve Three core technical challenge

70
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,640
which challenges which will really sort

71
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,840
of form the base of our business the

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,319
first was electrochemical stability so

73
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,480
there's a lot of CO2 conversion uh you

74
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,640
know a lot of CO2 conversion

75
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,200
electrolyzers out there the core

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,560
challenge that many of them share is

77
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,920
stability many of them will fail after

78
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,360
20 or 30 hours and we've been able to

79
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,400
demonstrate hundreds of hours of

80
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,200
continuously stable production

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,400
and that's key to some kind ofcial deoy

82
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,159
the second is if you want to do this

83
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,640
this of ccle that I just show you in an

84
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:12,720
Ecom way you have to be tolerant to

85
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,760
everything else that's that's in this in

86
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,040
this stream here and that includes

87
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,840
excess carbon monoxide hydrogen uh

88
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,080
methane nitrogen there there's so many

89
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,319
other compounds in there that in many

90
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,120
cases are toxic to today's CO2

91
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,400
conversion systems and so we had to

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,360
develop a system that is able to be

93
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,560
resilient to all of those and operate in

94
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,000
low concentrations of CO2 and then the

95
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,200
last one which is ironically the easiest

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,959
is just having a very tight control over

97
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,400
the ratio of hydrogen and carbon

98
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,519
monoxide that you're producing being

99
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,560
able to very reliably keep consistent

100
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,239
with that because that's what those

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,000
those furnaces are sensitive to is the

102
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,159
ratio of carbon monoxide and

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,959
hydrogen and so that's the cell that we

104
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:55,239
built it's a gaseous it's a gaseous

105
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,280
phase carbon dioxide conversion system

106
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,400
that pulls in flu gas whether it's from

107
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,400
an iron plant or or any other industrial

108
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,280
facility

109
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,640
and can coel the components of that flu

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,879
gas into the chemicals that those

111
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,560
facilities already use and so in the

112
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,360
Contex of iron obviously that's carbon

113
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,200
monoxide and hydrogen and we also make a

114
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,280
lot of oxygen as you might guess at the

115
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,000
anode and that's also something that has

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,639
a ton of value at at an industrial

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,800
facility and so we've already talked a

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,479
little bit about stability and and also

119
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,639
this the the the core piece of that is

120
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,080
not just stability of output of how much

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,120
you're producing but also stability

122
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,639
again in that ratio of hydrogen to

123
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,440
carbon monoxide and so we've shown that

124
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,400
we can actually produce a gas blend that

125
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,240
is exactly what you would get from

126
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,880
natural gas or even coal but with this

127
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,600
electrochemical closed loop

128
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,960
process and so as you might guess you

129
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,000
know that we're starting in Iron but

130
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,240
this is not a a technology that is

131
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,880
limited to just this industry you know

132
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,400
the ability to produce carbon monoxide

133
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,800
is a ubiquitous chemical feed stock and

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,240
has a lot of applications in things like

135
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,000
chemicals production for polymers

136
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,680
polycarbonates polyurethanes acetic acid

137
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,280
as well as a variety of metals like

138
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,199
copper for example that also go through

139
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,639
a similar kind of reduction process

140
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,520
we've also developed a catalyst that

141
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,199
uses the exact same cell that's a copper

142
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,440
based Catalyst for conversion of CO2 to

143
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,520
ethylene which we heard a little bit

144
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,280
about earlier and that cell is is

145
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,400
fundamentally the exact same system that

146
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,360
is all allows us to take dilute CO2 and

147
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,560
produce that chemical feed stock and so

148
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,039
the reason we're here in Japan is

149
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,479
because Japan is a leader in these

150
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,440
spaces we've already spoken to many of

151
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,400
you but both in steel and chemicals the

152
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,520
you know the many of the leading

153
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,560
companies are based here and we're

154
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,120
excited to partner with you so for us

155
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,479
where we are right now is looking for

156
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,000
some of those first deployments we have

157
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,440
a couple Pilots we're developing in the

158
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,240
United States but we're looking to

159
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,319
expand particularly with pilots in sort

160
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,400
of this uh one ton per day range as well

161
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,319
as joint development agreements and if

162
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,880
you're a buyer of green steel we'd love

163
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,759
to talk with you about how we can how we

164
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,639
can support that so with that thank you

165
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,199
for having me and uh hopefully come by

166
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,199
and chat with us later
