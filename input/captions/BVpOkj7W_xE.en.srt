1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,360
All right, welcome back to 61200. Hope

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,760
you all had a good spring break. Uh,

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,720
today and this week we continue our

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,199
segment on graph theory. Uh, going to do

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,840
more graphs. Today is undirected graphs

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,039
and next class will be directed graphs.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,119
Uh but remember an undirected graph or

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,719
the full mouthful is simple undirected

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,440
graph is what we defined a couple

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,559
lectures ago. Uh we have a set of

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,879
vertices V. We have a set of edges E

12
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,440
vertices can be anything but the edges

13
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,079
have to be pairs of vertices and those

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,399
vertices have to be distinct. So the set

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,239
of edges is always a subset of this.

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,199
This would be the maximum possible set

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,000
of edges. you have the set two two item

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:00,000
set uv for all vertices u and v where u

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,760
does not equal v. Okay. So uh today I'm

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
just going to remove omit these

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,280
adjectives and just say graph but

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,760
whenever I say graph today I really mean

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,320
simple undirected graph. Okay and we're

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,479
going to walk around in graphs today. Uh

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,400
so let's define a notion of walk.

26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,759
This is going to be similar to an

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,920
execution in uh state machines. Next

28
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,920
lecture will be even more like that. Uh

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,240
but for today uh a walk is a sequence of

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,040
vertices. I'm going to write that

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,240
sequence with arrows, but it's really

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:38,479
just a list.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,400
It's a finite sequence, let's say, uh

34
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:45,759
where

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,280
each consecutive uh vi to vi + one is an

36
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,680
edge

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,759
in the graph.

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,360
So this was like a valid transition in

39
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:59,040
the uh state machine world.

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,479
Uh so this is like I = 01

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,240
up to K minus one

42
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:11,160
is when that needs to apply. Uh so if

43
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,160
you have let me draw a graph here.

44
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,440
It's one of the first graphs I ever drew

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,239
in my life. still remember it for

46
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,640
reasons we will talk about in a moment.

47
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,440
Uh here's a graph with five vertices, a

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,620
bunch of edges, uh and let me get a

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,789
color.

50
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,789
[Applause]

51
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,280
So for example,

52
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,319
this is a path

53
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:48,239
which is uh sorry is a walk which I

54
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:57,040
would write A to B

55
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:58,400
to uh D to E to B back to D up to C.

56
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,959
That's writing it with commas. You can

57
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,319
also write it with arrows. Same thing.

58
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,480
Okay, so that's an example of a walk.

59
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,200
And for some terminology, it would be

60
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,200
helpful. We're going to call this a walk

61
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,360
uh from

62
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,599
V 0 to VK. V 0 is just the first vertex

63
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,519
in the sequence. VK is the last

64
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,560
sequence. I'm defining what from and two

65
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,560
means. Uh and we'll define the length of

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,519
this path

67
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,840
to equal K. K is the number of edges in

68
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,519
this uh sequence not the number of

69
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,599
vertices. Right? Number of edges is one

70
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,239
fewer than the number of vertices. So in

71
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,440
this example we have one two three four

72
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:46,640
five six edges. So this is a length six

73
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:50,400
uh walk. Okay. In particular we allow

74
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,239
uh length to equal zero.

75
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,879
What does a length zero walk look like?

76
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,360
Well it's a vertex and that's it. You

77
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,080
just stay there. So like C by itself is

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,400
a zero length walk. E by itself is a

79
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:07,439
zero length walk.

80
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:12,280
Okay, not so exciting yet. Uh let's

81
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,280
define a related notion which is path.

82
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,799
This is a special kind of walk uh with

83
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,400
no

84
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,120
repeated

85
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,120
vertices or edges.

86
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,440
Okay. Uh so in particular not this path.

87
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,759
Uh this this is this walk is not a path

88
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,360
because it visits some vertices multiple

89
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,360
times. It visits B twice. You can see

90
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,680
that in a sequence. It also visits some

91
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:49,880
edges multiple times. B to D is

92
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,880
repeated. Uh so if I redraw this graph

93
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,000
uh an example of a path between the same

94
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,720
two vertices would be this one. This is

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,440
still starting at A and ending at C, but

96
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,639
now it's shorter and it doesn't repeat

97
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,039
any vertices.

98
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,800
Okay, in particular with walks, if you

99
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,240
don't repeat uh a vertex, you probably

100
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,919
also don't repeat an edge. But I think

101
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,360
it's helpful here to highlight we really

102
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,039
don't want to repeat vertices or edges.

103
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,520
This will get a little more subtle uh

104
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,320
when we talk about closed walks in a

105
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,240
little bit. Uh so why might we care

106
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,880
about walking in a graph? Lots of

107
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,160
practical motivations. Every time you, I

108
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,680
don't know, look up something in Google

109
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,199
Maps, you're finding a path from A to B.

110
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,360
uh maybe you want the shortest path or

111
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,280
the least uh energy path or uh so on. Um

112
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,639
so we care about paths a lot when we're

113
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,080
finding routes in transportation

114
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,240
networks. We care about them when we're

115
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,560
finding routes on the internet or any

116
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,240
computer network. Uh in both those cases

117
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,720
the vertices are places you can be and

118
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,360
the edges are the routes like the

119
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,960
streets you can take for example. Um, in

120
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,960
a social network, if the vertices are

121
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,560
people and the edges are friendships,

122
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,639
then you might care about like degrees

123
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,520
of separation between people, like a

124
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:16,160
famous uh experiment where they asked

125
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,840
people to send physical letters to

126
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,759
people they knew on a firstname basis.

127
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,840
This is like in the 60s, Mgrim uh and uh

128
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,840
they found that the distance between two

129
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,960
people is only about six. These days is

130
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,600
about five. We're getting more

131
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,479
connected, display more people. Uh

132
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,000
anyway, those are some motivations. Also

133
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,400
in things like uh the eight puzzle that

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,520
we talked about uh some time ago, you

135
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,120
can think of each of these

136
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,440
configurations as vertices in a graph

137
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,199
and the edges are transitions. And

138
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,120
because uh every time I I make a move, I

139
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,720
can also unmake that move. This is an

140
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,440
undirected graph, right? Everywhere I

141
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,440
can go, I can immediately go back. And

142
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,280
uh you might care about what does the

143
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,759
this graph look like? It's big. It's got

144
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,919
like a 100,000 vertices. So I can't draw

145
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,240
it here but you can kind of explore it

146
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,039
by by moving around. Can you get

147
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,000
everywhere? That's a good question and

148
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,680
that's the next topic. Connectivity is

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,680
one of the is what this lecture is

150
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,039
mostly about.

151
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,039
So let's talk about

152
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,039
connectivity.

153
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:32,240
So we'll call uh two vertices connected

154
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,240
if there's a walk between them.

155
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,599
Now, I'd like to say there's a walk

156
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,520
between them, which is sort of not

157
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,759
caring about which one you start at and

158
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,400
which you end at. Uh, but the way we

159
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,800
define walk is it's it's starts at one

160
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,280
place and it goes to the other. Of

161
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,319
course, if v 0 to vk is a walk, then

162
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,080
also vk backwards to v 0 is also a walk.

163
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,360
Like if I flip the sequence, if I

164
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,759
reverse it, uh it's still a walk because

165
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,440
edges are sets. They don't care about

166
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,960
which order you follow them in. So if

167
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,879
you can go from vi to vi plus one, you

168
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,120
can go from vi plus1 to vi in an

169
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,960
undirected graph.

170
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,199
Uh so this is equivalent to uh there

171
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,199
existing a walk

172
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,400
from v to u like it doesn't matter which

173
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,919
one you put on the left and which you

174
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,080
put on the right. These are the same

175
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,839
thing. Uh technically this is a theorem.

176
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,959
You have to prove it. And the proof is

177
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,959
just reverse the walk.

178
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,000
If I have a walk from U to V, I can

179
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,440
reverse it and I get a walk from V to U.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,959
If I have a walk from V to U, I can

181
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,640
reverse it and get a walk from U to V.

182
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,160
So in either direction, uh these two

183
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,160
things are equivalent. And so we just

184
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,320
say there's a walk between U and V or we

185
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,959
say U and V are connected or V and U are

186
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,680
connected all the same thing.

187
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,560
Okay. Uh there are some other equivalent

188
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,040
properties to this. So I want to write

189
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,519
some more. Uh the other big one is there

190
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,839
exists a path

191
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,839
from VTU.

192
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,040
This is perhaps a good moment to

193
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,080
mention. So we're using words walk and

194
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,760
path here uh in one consistent way

195
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,360
throughout this class but there are

196
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,519
other classes such as the very next

197
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,519
class 6121 where uh this is called path

198
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,120
and this is called simple path. So just

199
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,959
a warning there's two sets of

200
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,920
terminologies for whether a walk is

201
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,959
allowed to walks can always repeat

202
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,880
vertices. Paths uh sometimes they can

203
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,880
sometimes they can't and in this class

204
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,640
they cannot. So we're going to use walk

205
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,920
to mean the general thing and path to

206
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,920
mean the specific thing where you don't

207
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,480
repeat any vertices or edges. Okay. So

208
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,040
uh I claim there's a walk from U to V if

209
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,600
and only if there's a path from U to V.

210
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,600
Let's prove this.

211
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,959
Um so remember how do we prove that two

212
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,959
things are equivalent? How do we prove

213
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,880
an if and only if? We do it in two

214
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,000
parts. We prove left to right and right

215
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,720
to left. So, I'm going to do right to

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,480
left first because this is the easy one.

217
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,360
Why is it I ask you uh if I have a path

218
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:27,839
from U to V, is there necessarily a walk

219
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,480
from U to V? Any suggestions?

220
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,720
Yeah.

221
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,800
A path is a walk. Path is a special kind

222
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,160
of walk. So, if I have a path, then

223
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,320
definitely I have a walk because that

224
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,959
path is the walk. So I would usually

225
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,160
write uh path

226
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,640
is a kind of walk.

227
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,160
So that's the easy direction.

228
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,640
The more impressive thing is that if

229
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,800
there's a uh a walk, then there's

230
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,720
actually not only is there a walk, but

231
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,519
there's a walk that doesn't repeat any

232
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,160
uh vertices or edges. This is trickier.

233
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,160
Um, and

234
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:09,160
I'm going to tell you how to find it

235
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,160
because it needs a a nifty idea.

236
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,160
But first, we write the template, which

237
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,000
is okay, we want to prove that if

238
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,519
there's a walk from U to V, then there's

239
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,959
a path. So, let's assume there's a walk

240
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,959
from U to V. And let's give it

241
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,279
uh I'm not going to give it a name yet.

242
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,760
Um, so there exists a walk. There might

243
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,440
be many walks. I want to try to choose

244
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,920
not necessarily a particular one but a

245
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,680
more restricted type of walk that's

246
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,800
possible because I know that these at

247
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,279
least exist. So I want to take a

248
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,279
shortest walk.

249
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,560
Shortest in terms of uh length. So

250
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,120
minimum possible length among all walks.

251
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,200
I want one of them that minimizes the

252
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,120
length of the walk. Okay, we know there

253
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,279
exists some walk. So there is some

254
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,279
solution here. Uh because you can't go

255
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,680
below a walk of length zero. There's

256
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,360
some shortest.

257
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,000
Okay, and this one I'm going to give a

258
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,880
name. Let's say it starts at U, which is

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
also called V 0. Then it goes to V1.

260
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:19,760
Then it goes to V2, and so on until it

261
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,480
reaches V K, which equals V. So it's a

262
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,600
walk from U to V.

263
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,720
using some number of edges in between.

264
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,079
Okay. But now I know it's shortest.

265
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:36,440
All right. Uh

266
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,440
so I claim

267
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,240
uh that this is a path from U to V. I

268
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,000
claim that there are no repeated

269
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,440
vertices or edges in the sequence. uh in

270
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
particular I claim that there are no

271
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:57,560
repeated vertices. So let's uh

272
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,560
prove the claim.

273
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,959
So uh maybe as a picture first. Um so

274
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,959
suppose that let's let's do it by

275
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,959
contradiction.

276
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:19,040
Let's suppose that uh the path

277
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,440
uh does repeat a vertex. So it starts at

278
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:28,399
u and it then it goes which is v 0 then

279
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:30,320
it goes to v1 and so on. Um maybe at

280
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,480
some point

281
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,880
uh after going for a while it comes back

282
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:43,519
to a vertex it's been to before before

283
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:45,200
proceeding to uh vk over here which is v

284
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,600
Okay, this is what a walk looks like

285
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
that repeats at least one vertex. I

286
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,480
claim this is a general picture, but you

287
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:56,160
can write it down in words. Um, then the

288
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,079
idea is, well, if if the walk did this,

289
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,399
I should draw this as a continuous path

290
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,279
in red.

291
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:07,120
If the walk did this where it repeats

292
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,360
this vertex twice, why not just do this?

293
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,720
That's a shorter path. And that

294
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,800
contradicts that we started with the

295
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,240
shortest path. If this path is strictly

296
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,000
shorter than this one, that's a

297
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,399
contradiction.

298
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,760
Write that down a little more carefully.

299
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:26,959
Um let's uh so for contradiction, let's

300
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:29,120
say that uh vi equals vj for some i less

301
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:34,160
than j.

302
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:37,440
So this would be both vi and vj are the

303
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,040
same vertex in this sequence. The vertex

304
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,880
gets repeated. That's a general

305
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,959
situation. I can assume I is less than J

306
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,399
just by reabeling I and J swapping I and

307
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,320
J if I need to. And now um the idea is

308
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,880
that v 0

309
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:58,880
up to vi which equals vj and then going

310
00:14:52,880 --> 00:15:00,720
directly to vj + one vj + 2 and so on up

311
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:06,040
to vk

312
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,040
uh is a shorter shorter walk

313
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,360
from between the same two vertices still

314
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,760
from u to v and so that is a

315
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,760
contradiction.

316
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,560
And so that ends the proof of the claim.

317
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,720
And that ends the proof of this claim

318
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,800
that if there's a walk, uh, I can turn

319
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,560
it into a path. I take the shortest

320
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,040
shortest walk. And it turns out that

321
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,800
must be a path. Proof by contradiction.

322
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,079
Okay,

323
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,000
so a bunch of work there. But now, uh,

324
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,600
for connectivity sake, we can use walk

325
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,519
when it's convenient. We can use path

326
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,279
when it's convenient.

327
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,040
Okay, for connectivity, these two

328
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,920
notions are interchangeable. We can use

329
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,000
whatever is nicest. All right, let me

330
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,519
mention a couple other fun properties of

331
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,279
connectivity

332
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,480
over here.

333
00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:01,320
Um, so this one walk from U to V versus

334
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,320
V to U is property we call symmetry.

335
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:10,240
And there are two other properties uh

336
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:11,920
that are nice to know. One is called

337
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,560
reflexivity

338
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,480
uh or or this is the reflexive property.

339
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:22,399
Every vertex is connected to itself.

340
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,440
Why? Uh because we allowed zero length

341
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,279
walks and paths starting at V and doing

342
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,360
nothing that is a valid walk. So that's

343
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:33,360
a walk from V to V. Um and another

344
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,759
useful fact

345
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,759
is transitivity.

346
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:45,079
Connectedness is transitive relation. Uh

347
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,079
if we have U and V are connected

348
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,680
and we have V and W are connected

349
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,519
then we know uh U and W are connected.

350
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,360
Why?

351
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,360
Uh this is a particularly nice uh proof

352
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,799
by picture. Please don't think that

353
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,679
proof by picture is a valid proof

354
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,559
method. But uh I'll tell you the words

355
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,880
in a second. Suppose we have U vertices

356
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,000
UV and W and there's some path from U to

357
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,319
V and there's some path from V to W.

358
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,520
Well then there's a path from U to W.

359
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,520
You just concatenate the paths

360
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,200
or concatenate the walks.

361
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,200
We could at this point we could we could

362
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,120
assume we had paths initially but when

363
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,600
we glue them together it won't be a path

364
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,120
anymore necessarily. It might be a walk.

365
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,360
There might be some repetitions here and

366
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,720
here. But for the easy proof uh just

367
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,120
take uh take two walks concatenate them.

368
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,679
Still a walk. Therefore you and W are

369
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,120
connected. Okay. Uh next week we'll talk

370
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,200
about these properties symmetry,

371
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,720
reflexivity and transitivity even more.

372
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,400
So this is kind of a foreshadowing of

373
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,200
that. uh but it lets us define uh some

374
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,520
cool concepts

375
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,640
uh about connectivity. So first we're

376
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,640
going to call a graph connected

377
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,320
if uh

378
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:23,760
u and v are connected

379
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,000
for all vertices u and v.

380
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,559
So we sometimes call this uh pair-wise

381
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,480
connected. Pairwise is a useful notion

382
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,640
when you have uh something that only

383
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,799
makes sense on pairs of elements but you

384
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,320
want it to apply to the whole structure.

385
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,720
In this case the whole graph not just

386
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,120
pairs of vertices. Uh then you just put

387
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,120
a for all over the two things and that

388
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,480
that would be pair wise connected. Uh

389
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,960
but it really doesn't matter how you um

390
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,679
connected is kind of a robust notion

391
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,679
because of things like transitivity.

392
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,440
Like in in an undirected graph, it's the

393
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,440
same to say that every pair of vertices

394
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,840
is connected as it is to say that

395
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,160
there's some vertex that every ver that

396
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,880
every other vertex is connected to

397
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,960
because of transitivity. We know if you

398
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,240
can get from A to B and from B to C,

399
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,919
then you can also get from A to C. Okay.

400
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,559
So this is sort of why connect

401
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,600
connectivity is the right notion.

402
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:23,480
Uh even more interesting is a notion

403
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,480
called connected components.

404
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,120
So

405
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,840
So uh maybe let me draw an example

406
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,160
before I define this carefully. So this

407
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,080
graph for example is connected uh from

408
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,520
every vertex you can get to any other

409
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,520
right let's draw a disconnected graph

410
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,320
uh I had over here somewhere

411
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:18,480
let's say h got this guy here and maybe

412
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:25,600
just a vertex and some edge

413
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:29,840
AB C D E F G. So this is one graph. It

414
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,400
has six vertices, four edges.

415
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,320
Okay? And it's obviously not connected.

416
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,120
There's no walk, for example, from here

417
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:41,440
to here or from here to there, B to F, C

418
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,520
to E, whatever. Uh, but it's still

419
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,080
possible to get from A to C, A to B, A

420
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,840
to D. So A can get to everyone in this

421
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,679
chunk. And that chunk we call a

422
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,520
connected component. So in this graph

423
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,000
there are three connected components.

424
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,679
These are the mutually reachable regions

425
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
of the graph. Okay.

426
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,640
So, uh to define that precisely, I'm

427
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,840
going to you introduce a new term uh

428
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,840
which is induced subgraph.

429
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,480
Okay. So what does induce subgraph mean?

430
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,640
Uh it's a it's a notion given one graph

431
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,640
it defines a a graph that lives inside

432
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,799
the original graph. It's a subset of the

433
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,799
vertices and edges. That's what subgraph

434
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:39,280
means. Uh and it's defined by a set of

435
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,280
vertices. So it's a subgraph induced by

436
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,720
a particular set of vertices. In this

437
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,799
case uh the vertex set is all the

438
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,520
vertices connected to v. This is nice

439
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:54,760
shorthand for saying uh give me all the

440
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,760
u where u and v are connected.

441
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,080
And as we said doesn't matter whether I

442
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:04,000
say u and v or v and u same thing.

443
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,080
Uh and the edge set is determined by

444
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,600
this word induced. When I say induced I

445
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,280
mean I just specify the vertices and

446
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,600
then I want all the edges that could

447
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:16,880
possibly make sense. So in other words,

448
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:20,080
I want to take um all of the edges uv

449
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,280
that were in my original edge set with

450
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,000
the property that both u and v are in my

451
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,840
new vertex set.

452
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:35,280
So for example uh in this graph if I

453
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:37,039
take the subgraph induced by a b c d

454
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,360
that means I take these four vertices

455
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,039
and none of the others and I take all

456
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,799
the edges that are among those four

457
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,039
vertices.

458
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,039
Uh so that would be three of them these

459
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:51,919
three edges a to b to c and b to d are

460
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,760
the three edges in my induced subgraph

461
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,280
abcd.

462
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,880
uh if I just take the subset f and g

463
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,480
these are all the vertices connected to

464
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,640
f say uh then my subgraph will just be

465
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,520
this picture with these two vertices and

466
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,799
one edge connecting them

467
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,720
so that's what induced subgraph means

468
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,720
and so in particular if I take the

469
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,640
induced subgraph for vertices connected

470
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,000
to particular vertex I get what I call a

471
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,039
connected component so this is one

472
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,679
connected component here this is another

473
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,039
one and this is another And those are

474
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,280
the three connected components of the

475
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:32,080
graph. And in general uh the connected

476
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,799
components

477
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,799
partition the graph.

478
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,400
Partition means in this case that every

479
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:59,400
vertex or edge

480
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,400
is in exactly one connecting component.

481
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,799
So everybody is represented exactly

482
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,799
once.

483
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,240
Okay, this is just a fact which we will

484
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,520
take as given. It in some sense follows

485
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,240
from the symmetry reflexivity and

486
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,240
transitivity of the connectivity

487
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,240
relation.

488
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,360
Cool. So that's connected components.

489
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,159
Again many motivations for connected

490
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,880
components. Uh you would hope that the

491
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,039
road network of North America uh the

492
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,120
continental let's say continental United

493
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,960
States is connected. probably isn't

494
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,480
because of some weird things uh

495
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,600
disconnected things going on with

496
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,600
Canada. Uh or you might wonder uh is the

497
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,200
state space of this eight puzzle

498
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,440
connected? Can you get from any

499
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,880
configuration to any other? Or we

500
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,320
already know the answer is no. We proved

501
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,360
you can't get from an even permutation

502
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:02,080
to an odd permutation. Uh so uh this

503
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,919
example happens to be even. You can see

504
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,840
the number of ver of inversions written

505
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,400
down here. It's always even. uh and uh

506
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,559
if I take any other uh permutation

507
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,000
that's even uh it turns out it's

508
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,919
possible to get there. We didn't prove

509
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,520
that. But we did prove is that if we

510
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,279
take a different configuration where the

511
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,679
number of inversions is odd, all of

512
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,799
these configurations cannot get to

513
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,200
they're in a different connected

514
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,039
component from this one. And so it turns

515
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,880
out the eight puzzle has exactly two

516
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,360
connected components. One for the even

517
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,279
permutations, one for the odds. Uh the

518
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,960
Rubik's cube for example, depending on

519
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,760
how you define it, has 12 connected

520
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,360
components. Uh there, you know, in

521
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,679
general, you might care about how many

522
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,400
different types of states there are for

523
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,080
a given puzzle.

524
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,760
All right,

525
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:55,120
so that's uh a brief tour of

526
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:58,240
connectivity. Uh the next concept is

527
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,320
uh maybe I'll start with

528
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,720
right now we're just walking aimlessly

529
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,720
from one vertex to another. Let's think

530
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,080
about closing a loop. What if I it's I

531
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,840
guess it's even more aimless. I started

532
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,400
a vertex and what if I want to come back

533
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:16,200
to the same vertex? This is what we call

534
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,200
a closed walk.

535
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,080
So if a walk happens to start and end at

536
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,480
the same vertex, if v 0 equals vk, then

537
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,640
we call it closed.

538
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,400
And so in particular, we could try to

539
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:47,320
apply the closed notion to a path. That

540
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,320
would be kind of nice. Uh

541
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,320
so and we're going to give that a name

542
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,600
which is cycle.

543
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,240
Cycle is roughly this is not going to be

544
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,720
quite correct.

545
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,640
Start with closed path.

546
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,120
Can someone tell me what would be wrong

547
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,480
with this definition? If I say okay I

548
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,919
want I want to close. So closed is an

549
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,919
adjective that means you start and end

550
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,320
at the same vertex. If I apply it to

551
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,120
path, that means a walk, let's say from

552
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,600
some vertex V to the same vertex V with

553
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:28,120
no repeated vertices or edges. Any

554
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,120
problems with that? Yeah.

555
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,240
Right. The one you start with is going

556
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,760
to be repeated because that's what we

557
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,799
wanted. We want the start and the end to

558
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,960
be the same. So there is no closed path.

559
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,880
Actually, there's kind of one closed

560
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,039
path, which is the path that just starts

561
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,600
at a vertex V and doesn't go anywhere.

562
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,520
That I also want to exclude. This is

563
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,600
this is not this is not what I want to

564
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,520
call a cycle. So, there are two things.

565
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:57,279
I want a closed path of length more than

566
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,240
zero. You're not allowed to just stay

567
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,240
where you are. Um, and I need to add

568
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,559
this exception

569
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,799
uh that

570
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,640
the first vertex equals the last vertex.

571
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,880
I don't want any other vertices to be

572
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,880
the same.

573
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,520
Okay, so this is now this is sort of a

574
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,919
correct definition except I'm not a big

575
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,960
fan of definitions with exceptions. So I

576
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,279
will write another equivalent and less

577
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,720
controversial definition which is let's

578
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,520
start with our notion of walk

579
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,200
and we want a closed one

580
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,960
and so that implies that the first

581
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,880
vertex equals the last vertex and we

582
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,120
want no other repeated vertices or

583
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,120
edges.

584
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,520
And whereas with walk it was or with

585
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,279
path it wasn't that big a deal that I

586
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,039
said no repeated edges because if you

587
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,520
repeat an edge you also repeat its end

588
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,360
points. So repeating an edge implies

589
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,520
repeating vertices but I put them both

590
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,960
in there just for emphasis. Here it

591
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,640
actually matters to say a path with no a

592
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,559
closed walk with no other repeated

593
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,799
vertices or edges. There's another thing

594
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,120
that I want to exclude which is suppose

595
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:19,159
I have an edge

596
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,159
and I get my red color

597
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,279
and I start at this vertex. I go to the

598
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,120
other one and come back. Okay, you might

599
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,080
say, "Oh, that looks like a length two

600
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,600
cycle." But it's not. I don't want to

601
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,760
call this a length two cycle and it's

602
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,880
not allowed by this definition because

603
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,880
it repeats an edge,

604
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,240
right? It doesn't repeat any vertices

605
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:48,559
other than the ones it's supposed to. It

606
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:51,600
start the sequence here is uh u v u like

607
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:55,039
an emoji. Uh

608
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,480
so uh there's no repeated vertices

609
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,240
except the first one equaling the last

610
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,799
one, but there is a repeated edge. And

611
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,919
so I don't allow this. So this is not a

612
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,000
cycle. So in fact in an undirected graph

613
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,480
a cycle has to have length at least

614
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,399
three. The definition says it has to be

615
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:17,080
at least one. But uh oh I probably need

616
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,080
of length greater than zero here again.

617
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,440
Okay cool. So uh

618
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,600
cycle is sort of the analog of path and

619
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,279
closed walk is the analog of walk.

620
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,880
Obviously it's the closed version where

621
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,279
you come back to where you started.

622
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:38,159
Cycle is the best analog we have to a

623
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:41,039
closed path. Uh and these are nice in a

624
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,039
certain sense which I want to talk

625
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,039
about.

626
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:52,200
So let's talk about

627
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,200
a notion which is

628
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,919
an oiler walk and then we'll get to the

629
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,640
notion of

630
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,720
uh closed walk.

631
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,720
All right.

632
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:36,080
So uh oiler walk is a particular kind of

633
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:39,200
nice walk that visits all of the edges

634
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,880
exactly once. That's the definition.

635
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,640
Let's think about uh graphs where you

636
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,960
can take a walk starting somewhere,

637
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,960
ending somewhere and visit every edge

638
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:54,200
exactly once. For example,

639
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,200
this graph

640
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,279
has such a walk. The first graph that I

641
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,120
drew. This is why I was fascinated with

642
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,559
it reading some Scientific American

643
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,279
article by uh Martin Gardner.

644
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,559
Uh, you can draw this graph without

645
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,799
picking up your pen. You pen down, you

646
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,320
draw, and then you pen up. And that got

647
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,320
all of the edges. Okay, I didn't draw

648
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,159
the vertices, but hopefully you can

649
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,519
imagine that. Maybe you should draw the

650
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,480
vertices first, and then you could draw

651
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,519
all the edges in one swoop. So, this is

652
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,679
kind of a nice notion. Um,

653
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:31,120
if you like drawing things with pen or

654
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,600
pencil or stylus, whatever. Um, it's

655
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,480
actually a very old notion. Um, it goes

656
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,720
back to Oiler. Unsurprisingly, this guy

657
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,679
Leonard Oiler, who you know from like

658
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,960
the number E, that's E for Oiler. Uh, in

659
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:48,399
1736, he drew this rather beautiful

660
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,120
diagram of some islands and bridges in

661
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:55,360
Kigburg, which then was in Germany, now

662
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,279
is in Russia. Uh, and it has a this this

663
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,840
place, the city is famous for very

664
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,760
beautiful bridges, as many cities are.

665
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,039
But this one has a lot of them and some

666
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:08,320
non-trivial interesting uh topology. And

667
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:11,279
so he he wondered the the question was

668
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,919
posed, can you visit all of the bridges

669
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,760
without any repeats? Seems natural,

670
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,440
right? And if you think about it, right,

671
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,559
this is the vertices are like islands.

672
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,519
The edges are bridges and you want to

673
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:26,559
visit all the edges exactly once. Okay,

674
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,559
so natural problem also if you're

675
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,120
sightseeing and just for fun because I

676
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,919
dug up this 1736 paper here are some

677
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,320
more beautiful figures from that paper

678
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,559
um thinking about all the different

679
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,559
cases. So he characterized and this is

680
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,799
like the first paper one of the very

681
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,320
first papers in graph theory. This

682
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,000
started the whole world of graph theory

683
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,320
that we're talking about is

684
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,519
characterizing when this is possible and

685
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,919
when it isn't. It turns out uh in this

686
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,240
original example it's not possible.

687
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,240
Today some of these bridges have

688
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,080
collapsed or been destroyed. So maybe

689
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,519
it's possible again. I don't know about

690
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,880
current day uh Kingsburg. But uh that's

691
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,200
what we're going to talk about now is

692
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:14,159
when do oiler walks exist?

693
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,599
Why was it possible for that house graph

694
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,240
but not possible for

695
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,639
uh

696
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,079
this graph

697
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,520
this is the complete graph on four

698
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,919
vertices and you can't draw this in a

699
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,119
single path. Why is my red chalk always

700
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,359
the farthest possible point?

701
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,359
So let's try. This will not be a proof

702
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,679
that you can't do it, but we will

703
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,560
shortly prove that you can't do it in

704
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:47,119
one stroke. So, I can go here, here,

705
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:51,320
here, uh, here, here. It's pretty good.

706
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,320
But I missed this edge.

707
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,920
This edge is uncovered.

708
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,000
And turns out it's not possible for that

709
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,480
graph. It was possible for this graph.

710
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:08,240
Even better would be uh

711
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,000
I guess in the case

712
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,640
in the tourism case let's go back to

713
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,680
Kingsburg for a second uh suppose your

714
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,760
hotel is in island A you start there you

715
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,960
kind of like to end at the same hotel

716
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:25,200
without having to repeat a bridge again

717
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,200
so that would be an order closed

718
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,920
And that we call an orther tour just

719
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,160
because that's more common terminology

720
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,000
for it. Uh so that's really you where

721
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,920
you start. So closed means that you

722
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,680
start and end at the same place. Orther

723
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,320
means you visit every edge exactly once

724
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,320
every edge of the graph. Okay. So that's

725
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,680
even nicer. Turns out that's not

726
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,079
possible in this graph.

727
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,960
If you look at it, I started at this

728
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:01,040
vertex here and I ended at this vertex

729
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,040
here.

730
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,400
And it's that was the best I could do. I

731
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,560
couldn't actually start and end at the

732
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,760
same vertex. If, for example, I added uh

733
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,359
another vertex and a couple more edges,

734
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,240
then it would be possible for me to

735
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,480
complete the tour like this. Okay. So

736
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,160
that the new graph I drew here with six

737
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,560
vertices instead of five. That one has

738
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,400
an oiler tour. The original one just had

739
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,320
an oiler walk. And this one has neither.

740
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,640
So how can we characterize which graphs

741
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,640
these are?

742
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,280
So we're not going to read or's paper.

743
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:40,320
It's in Latin. Bit hard for me to read.

744
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,839
Uh we'll

745
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,200
write our own proof. This will be the

746
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:46,800
main theorem of the day. Though we have

747
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,560
a fun topic afterwards as well. Uh so

748
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,200
first let's think about the tour case

749
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,079
that turns out to be cleaner. So graph

750
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,079
has an oiler tour

751
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:01,160
if and only if it's connected.

752
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,079
That's certainly necessary because we've

753
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,359
said it should visit every vertex. Um

754
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,480
you don't have to include this as part

755
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,520
of the definition but it makes the

756
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:18,920
characterization cleaner.

757
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,920
Uh and we also need that every vertex

758
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,920
has even degree

759
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,119
for an order two or for closed walk we

760
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,760
need every vertex to have even degree.

761
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,680
Let's check that in our examples. This

762
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,280
graph remember the degree of a vertex is

763
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,680
how many edges are incident to it. So

764
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:42,000
the degree of this vertex is

765
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,440
three. degree of this vertex is three.

766
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,680
This graph is symmetric. So all the

767
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:50,000
vertices have degree three. Three is an

768
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:52,079
odd number and not even right. Uh in

769
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,160
this graph, this is degree two. This is

770
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,560
degree four. This is degree four. So far

771
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,640
everything's even. Uh this one is degree

772
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,480
three. This one is degree three. In the

773
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,040
original graph, if I add this dotted

774
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,480
part, then I convert this into degree

775
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,240
four and degree four and degree two down

776
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,320
here. And so then all the vertices have

777
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,119
even degree. So it seems to be working.

778
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:17,400
But let's not do a proof by example. Uh

779
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,400
let's prove it in general.

780
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,240
Okay.

781
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,520
So uh again this is the top level

782
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,040
statement here is an if and only if. So

783
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,440
we need to prove each direction

784
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,720
separately. Let's start with the easy

785
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:37,359
direction which is left to right. So if

786
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:41,599
I have an oiler tour

787
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:45,240
uh let's give it a name. Consider

788
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,240
an oiler tour

789
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:55,040
uh v 0 to v1

790
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:59,119
to uh v k and vk equals v 0

791
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:03,119
right that's because it's a closed walk

792
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,640
all right now I want to look at

793
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,440
uh

794
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:11,560
let's basically count

795
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,560
uh edges is

796
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:20,280
incident

797
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,280
to vi or some vertex.

798
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,880
I think that's unnecessary sentence. Let

799
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:30,320
me rewind.

800
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,359
Uh let's look at

801
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,680
each visit.

802
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,599
uh vi -1

803
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,680
to vi

804
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,680
to vi + 1

805
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,680
uh

806
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,599
to a vertex vi. So uh in this path I'm

807
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,160
just looking at a a little piece of the

808
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,599
path of two consecutive edges from vi

809
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,960
minus1 to vi to vi + one. And I'd like

810
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,119
this to work even with wraparound uh

811
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,480
because this is a closed tour. We start

812
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,960
at V 0 and we end at V 0. So, you know,

813
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,760
we do some stuff

814
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,880
and then we end up back at V 0.

815
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,359
Uh, so I'd like to just consider three

816
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:19,200
consecutive vertices on this tour.

817
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:22,240
Sorry, the wrong directions this way.

818
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,480
Including possibly V0. So to do that I

819
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:31,040
want to treat this modulo

820
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:34,000
uh k + one I guess and this also modulo

821
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:37,599
or no modulo k actually

822
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,079
because k vk equals v 0. So if I work

823
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,000
modulo K with these indices and for

824
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,280
every vertex I look at the one previous

825
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,440
possibly wrapping around to VK minus one

826
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,520
or VI plus one possibly wrapping around

827
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,440
back to V 0 uh then this is a well-

828
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,160
definfined notion for every vertex on

829
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,640
this visit. Okay, when I look at this

830
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,119
that visit to vi

831
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,720
uh in partic that's visiting a vertex

832
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:07,280
and it also includes or visits uh two

833
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:11,000
edges

834
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,000
incident to vi

835
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,160
sort of what goes in must come out. So

836
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,680
if I'm looking at a vertex here, VI,

837
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:24,480
this is the previous one.

838
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:28,640
No, this is the previous one. VI minus

839
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,720
one to VI + one. Uh by visiting VI, I

840
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,520
visited one edge coming into VI and I

841
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,319
visited one edge coming out of VI. And

842
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,880
so that's two. And maybe this path

843
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:41,040
visits this vertex VI again as some

844
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,119
other vertex VJ. But every time it

845
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,880
visits a vertex, it visits two edges

846
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,760
incident to it.

847
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,440
Okay, so that means the total number of

848
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,599
edges visited is going to be even

849
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,400
because I just keep adding two and then

850
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,560
two more and two more. So total number

851
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,119
of edges

852
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,119
uh I guess visited

853
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:08,440
edges

854
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,440
incident to to any vertex

855
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,240
must be even.

856
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,599
And how many how many edges incident to

857
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,400
that vertex do I visit? Well, all of

858
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:26,240
them because an oiler walk has to visit

859
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,839
every edge exactly once by the end. So

860
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,599
this total number of visited edges

861
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:33,079
incident to a vertex, that's exactly the

862
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,079
degree of the vertex.

863
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,440
It's exactly the total number of

864
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,599
incident edges. So this shows that if

865
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,520
you have an oiler tour, all the degrees

866
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,160
must be even.

867
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,480
Okay, what goes in must come out. It

868
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,720
also has to be connected just because it

869
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,040
has to visit every vertex. And so by

870
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,359
visiting every vertex in particular that

871
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,680
is a walk between any pair of vertices

872
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,000
or you take pieces of that walk and you

873
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,240
can go from any vertex to any other.

874
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,780
Okay. So that's one direction. That's

875
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:08,969
the easy one. Let's do the hard one.

876
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,969
[Applause]

877
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,640
And although I won't be explicit about

878
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,280
it, this proof also in some sense gives

879
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:46,640
you a strategy for finding these tours.

880
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:50,680
They're not too hard to find.

881
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,680
Okay, next page.

882
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,079
So now we want to go from right to left.

883
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:01,440
So we get to assume

884
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,599
that the graph is connected

885
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,599
and that all the vertices have even

886
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,599
degree.

887
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,400
Say all degrees even.

888
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,960
and we want to show that the graph has

889
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,280
an oiler tour.

890
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,119
Okay, for this proof,

891
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,599
so there's one clever idea and then the

892
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,680
rest is just mechanical. Um

893
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,599
whereas before in this proof that I just

894
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,079
erased, in order to convert a walk into

895
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,160
a path, we took the shortest path,

896
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,040
shortest walk, and the shortest walk

897
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,400
ended up having to be a path. For oiler

898
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,920
tour, we kind of want to do the

899
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,319
opposite. I want the longest walk that

900
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,000
doesn't repeat any edges. The longest

901
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:47,920
walk that doesn't repeat any edges. That

902
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,920
turns out it will visit every edge

903
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,839
exactly once.

904
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,960
Uh so for that it's maybe useful to

905
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,319
define another term which is trail.

906
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,560
We're really not going to use this much

907
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:02,560
in the class so feel free to forget it

908
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:06,560
other than in the context of this proof

909
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,800
which is a walk with no repeated edges.

910
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:11,520
So in other words, it visits every edge

911
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,640
at most once. And then we're going to

912
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,040
take the longest trail. So subject to

913
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,160
every edge being visited at most once, I

914
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,880
want to visit as many edges as possible.

915
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,040
And that turns out it will be an oiler

916
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,640
walk.

917
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:35,440
Okay. So let's uh

918
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:37,839
take the longest trail in the graph

919
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,040
and I'll call it t

920
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:46,839
and it's going to say start at vertex v

921
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,839
0 go to v1 and go to vk.

922
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,920
Okay, I need to prove two things about

923
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,800
this trail, right? In order to be

924
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,880
an oiler tour, it has to be oiler. It

925
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,280
has to visit every edge exactly once and

926
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,960
it has to be closed.

927
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,800
Turns out it's helpful to prove closed

928
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,800
first. So first claim

929
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,880
is that

930
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,880
this trail t is closed.

931
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:22,319
All right.

932
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:25,200
So we start at V 0 we end at VK closed

933
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,200
means that V 0 equals VK.

934
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,200
So if we do let's do a proof by

935
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,200
contradiction.

936
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,680
Uh suppose

937
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,960
V 0 does not equal VK.

938
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,359
Okay. Okay. And I want to get a

939
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,359
contradiction which basically means that

940
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:55,680
somehow I want to show the trail was not

941
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:59,839
actually longest in that case.

942
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:03,680
So again we have some we we start at V 0

943
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:06,319
we do some wiggly path and we end at VK.

944
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,760
And supposing these are different.

945
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,319
I'd like to claim that I can make this

946
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:13,760
walk longer. In particular, I claim that

947
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:16,240
there's an edge out of VK that I haven't

948
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,720
visited yet, which means I could extend

949
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,200
the path by one.

950
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:24,400
Okay, that's my claim. And I'm going to

951
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,720
do that by counting the edges at VK. How

952
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,599
many have I used?

953
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,400
Very similar to this proof actually.

954
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,960
So VK, so this is another sequence from

955
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:38,160
V 0 to VK except now we have not equals

956
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:42,720
at the end. So let's think about all the

957
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:45,440
visits to VK by this. I should really be

958
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,280
pointing at this. So here's VK. We know

959
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,800
there's a visit at the end. Possibly

960
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,839
it's visited in between. Maybe some of

961
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,280
the VI equal VK. We know V 0 doesn't

962
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:57,040
equal VK, but some of the others might

963
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,720
be. Every time I visit one of those, it

964
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:04,480
looks exactly like this. In other words,

965
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:10,319
I visit two edges incident to VK.

966
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:14,560
So uh let's say for every uh vi that's

967
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:17,839
equal to vk uh we visit

968
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:20,800
two edges

969
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:23,040
incident

970
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,559
to vk.

971
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:31,760
So that's an even number in total.

972
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:33,440
Uh this is for i not equal to k.

973
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,079
But then there's this last visit at the

974
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,319
end and there we this one is special

975
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,160
because we stop there's no edge after VK

976
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:42,160
because this doesn't loop around. So

977
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,240
there's an edge before coming into VK

978
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:48,520
but none after.

979
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,520
So that means uh

980
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:56,319
I guess uh for I equal K for that visit

981
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:59,359
to VK we visit

982
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:03,240
one edge

983
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,240
incident to VK.

984
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,680
So in this trail how many edges incident

985
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,760
to VK did we visit? an odd number

986
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,000
because we had an even number for all

987
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,480
the earlier visits and then we had one

988
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
more at the end. So even plus one is

989
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:22,720
odd.

990
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:27,119
So that means uh t visits

991
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:31,440
an odd number of edges

992
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:34,160
incident to v.

993
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,160
But we assume that the degrees are even

994
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:40,240
and that means there's at least one more

995
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:42,400
edge, right? We assumed

996
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,440
here all degrees are even. So in

997
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:50,640
particular VK's degree is even and so

998
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:58,680
that means uh there exists an edge

999
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:58,680
incident to VK not uh visited by T.

1000
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,000
But then we can extend

1001
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
T.

1002
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:16,319
uh it can it can go uh in from v 0

1003
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:18,720
uh up to vk and then plus whatever one

1004
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:22,720
more edge.

1005
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:25,119
So if I call this edge here uh VK comm,

1006
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:29,119
VK plus one because I haven't defined a

1007
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:32,800
VK plus one yet. Then this will become a

1008
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,960
strictly longer trail

1009
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:39,200
because that edge wasn't visited before.

1010
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:43,559
Uh but now it is. This is a longer

1011
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,559
trail. Contradiction.

1012
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:52,319
What did it contradict? I assumed here

1013
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,079
that v 0 does not equal vk. So in fact

1014
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,760
we learned that v 0 equals vk. In other

1015
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,760
words, t is closed. So I've proved this

1016
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,240
claim. I haven't yet proved the whole

1017
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,480
thing I want. So at this point I've

1018
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:05,680
proved

1019
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,280
that my walk is closed

1020
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,680
but I still need to prove that it's

1021
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,839
oiler. Those are the two things I need

1022
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,839
to show.

1023
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:18,240
So let's do that next.

1024
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:22,290
[Applause]

1025
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:41,040
All right. So, second claim.

1026
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,040
This will be the last one for this

1027
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,040
proof.

1028
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:55,240
So t visits every edge.

1029
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:55,240
I'm going to give it a name uv

1030
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:01,520
in the edge side of the graph. So uh

1031
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,359
this is what I want because by

1032
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,760
definition because I started with a

1033
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:07,760
trail it has no repeated edges. So it

1034
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,119
visits every edge at most once and this

1035
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,119
is saying that it visits every edge at

1036
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,440
least once

1037
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:15,599
and therefore it it in fact visits every

1038
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,880
edge exactly once and that's definition

1039
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:21,880
of oiler. Okay, so that's what I need to

1040
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,880
prove.

1041
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:28,960
Again, proof by contradiction.

1042
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:32,079
Not sure why, but today has lots of

1043
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:37,520
contradictions in it.

1044
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:40,559
Seems to be the easiest way. Uh suppose

1045
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,559
not, this is the very concise way to say

1046
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:47,280
suppose that it doesn't visit some edge

1047
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:49,920
UV and E. I'll write it out. uh

1048
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,480
doesn't

1049
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:56,559
visit

1050
00:52:52,480 --> 00:53:00,240
some edge

1051
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:01,760
uv E.

1052
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,319
Okay, again I want to get a

1053
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:06,240
contradiction to uh t being the longest

1054
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:09,040
trail. So I'm going to somehow try to

1055
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,040
make t longer.

1056
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:14,800
So it doesn't visit uv but you know it

1057
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:17,440
visits some stuff v 0 to vk. So, let's

1058
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:23,440
try to connect them together.

1059
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:26,480
So, we've got here's uh the edge UV

1060
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:29,040
that's not covered. And then uh over

1061
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,839
here we have V 0

1062
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:34,079
some crazy path. Can we revisit vertices

1063
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:37,280
and whatever? It's a walk. Sorry, I keep

1064
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:39,200
saying path when I mean walk to VK. Oh,

1065
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:42,000
actually at this point we know that VK

1066
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:44,720
equals V 0. So, it it ends where it

1067
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,559
started.

1068
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,960
But somehow it doesn't use this edge. It

1069
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:55,640
might use these vertices, it might not.

1070
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:55,640
Uh, but what I'd like to do is connect

1071
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:06,280
V to V 0, which is also VK.

1072
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,280
Why can I do that?

1073
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,359
How do I know? I claim there's a walk.

1074
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,559
Yeah,

1075
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,319
because we assume the graph is

1076
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,520
connected.

1077
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:25,520
Uh way up here, assume connected. That's

1078
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,640
part of this characterization. So when

1079
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,760
we're going from right to left, we get

1080
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,680
to assume the graph is connected.

1081
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,119
Therefore, all pairs of vertices have a

1082
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,119
walk. So in particular, these two

1083
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,200
vertices have a walk. Now, it's not part

1084
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,359
of the trail. It's just another walk. So

1085
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:40,319
this thing over here is T. And this

1086
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:45,800
thing I'm going to call W.

1087
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:45,800
Okay. So let's write down some words. Uh

1088
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:56,880
G is connected.

1089
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:58,880
Uh so there exists a walk

1090
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,000
w

1091
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:05,119
uh or sorry the notes I called it x I

1092
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:11,160
guess x for connection

1093
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:11,160
from v to v k.

1094
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,319
Okay.

1095
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,400
Um

1096
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:22,960
I think I really want this to be a path.

1097
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,200
don't mind.

1098
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,240
We know for connectivity sake this is

1099
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,359
the same thing. If there's a walk,

1100
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:32,640
there's also a path. So now let's assume

1101
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:34,240
furthermore this is a path

1102
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,920
in particular because I want it to be a

1103
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:38,800
trail. So I don't want it to repeat any

1104
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,720
edges. Uh

1105
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,880
and a path won't repeat vertices or

1106
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,720
edges. So that's a little better. It's

1107
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,119
even better.

1108
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,520
All right. And I'm going to give this

1109
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:51,920
path some words. So it starts at V which

1110
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:56,400
we're going to call X0 and then it goes

1111
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:57,920
to X1 and so on to

1112
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:03,280
uh

1113
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:08,240
XL I guess which is V K.

1114
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:11,359
It ends it ends at VK which is also V0.

1115
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:14,160
Okay. Now I claim I can make the path

1116
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:16,079
longer.

1117
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,280
Sorry. I can make the original trail t

1118
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:22,160
longer as follows. I'm going to start at

1119
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,400
U. I'm going to go to V. I'm going to

1120
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,440
follow X.

1121
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,280
And now I'm at the loop.

1122
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,799
And then I want to loop around. H. That

1123
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:36,000
doesn't quite work because plausibly

1124
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:38,559
some of the vertices along X here.

1125
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,440
Maybe there's some vertex here which is

1126
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:44,079
actually on this path. Sorry, on the

1127
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,599
trail T.

1128
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,000
I want to give this vertex a name. So

1129
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:52,240
the whole path is called x. This vertex

1130
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:55,760
I want to call x sub i.

1131
00:56:52,240 --> 00:57:00,160
So let's uh

1132
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:04,079
let x subi which is also some v subj

1133
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:06,640
uh be the first

1134
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:10,319
vertex

1135
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:13,319
of x that's on

1136
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:13,319
t.

1137
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,599
Okay. Uh, you know, we start at some

1138
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:20,319
vertex. It might it may be the very

1139
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:23,119
first vertex v is actually on t. So then

1140
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:25,119
x subi is actually x sub0.

1141
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,920
But we know eventually we get on to t

1142
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:30,160
because the last vertex on this path x,

1143
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:34,319
this is the path x. We know the last

1144
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:36,480
vertex is v k and that's on t.

1145
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,760
Okay. So somewhere along the way, could

1146
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,599
be the first vertex, could be the last

1147
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,000
one, could be anywhere in between, we

1148
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,920
intersect T,

1149
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,680
and that's going to be my path. So I'm

1150
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:51,359
going to start at U, go to V, follow X

1151
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:55,920
until I reach T. And now T is a is a

1152
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:58,880
loop, is a closed walk, and

1153
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,880
I'm going to follow that walk as it was

1154
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:05,480
before.

1155
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,480
I wish I didn't draw this quite so long.

1156
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:10,640
exactly what I had before. This is

1157
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:13,040
exactly the same edge as I had before or

1158
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:16,640
walk. So, we can stop here. I claim that

1159
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:20,400
this red red walk that I drew is a

1160
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:22,400
longer trail. Why is it longer? Because

1161
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,559
it has this edge now, UV, which it

1162
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,480
didn't before. And it has all the edges

1163
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,240
we had before. Maybe it has some more

1164
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,160
here, but it also might not. Maybe these

1165
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,799
two vertices are the same. But we got at

1166
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:35,760
least plus one here. and we visited all

1167
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:37,839
the edges we had before and uh because

1168
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,799
of the way we chose xi all of these

1169
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:43,359
edges were not used before. So it's

1170
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:47,839
still a trail.

1171
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:52,559
Uh and so I guess what do I write? Uh u

1172
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:59,040
to v uh which is also known as x0.

1173
00:58:52,559 --> 00:59:02,799
Uh then we go to x i. x i equals uh vj.

1174
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:06,000
And then we go to VJ + one and so on

1175
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:09,599
around T. I in the notes I wrote it

1176
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,760
explicitly. You go from VJ up to V K and

1177
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:16,559
then you loop around and you go from V 0

1178
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:20,000
up to V J again. And that will be uh all

1179
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:24,599
the edges we had before.

1180
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,599
Uh, so it's longer

1181
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:29,920
and it still be a trail because we

1182
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:32,960
didn't uh all the edges that we added

1183
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,880
were not in the original trail t and

1184
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:37,680
because we assumed a path here, there

1185
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:40,160
weren't any duplicate edges within x.

1186
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:45,000
And so I think we're good. And that

1187
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,000
proves uh a contradiction

1188
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:50,960
because we assumed that t was a longest

1189
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,920
trail. Therefore, t actually visits

1190
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:56,000
every edge in the graph. It also visits

1191
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,000
every vertex at least once just because

1192
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,920
the graph is connected. If you visit all

1193
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,040
the edges and your graph is connected,

1194
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:05,680
then you definitely visit all the

1195
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:08,640
vertices. Okay, so uh that proves this

1196
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:11,280
theorem. Any questions? A lot of details

1197
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:14,920
there. Uh it's one of our bigger proofs,

1198
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,920
but it's pretty cool.

1199
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:25,200
All right. Uh let me this was Oiler

1200
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,880
tours. You might also wonder about oiler

1201
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,960
walks.

1202
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,520
So we've now shown in particular that

1203
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,440
this graph with the extra vertex here is

1204
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,640
indeed orarian. I mean I also drew it

1205
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,480
but we now understand why

1206
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:41,119
when I remove this vertex not all the

1207
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,839
vertex degrees were even. Two of them

1208
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:46,160
were odd. It turns out that's the right

1209
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:50,079
answer.

1210
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:52,160
So uh correlary remember means a theorem

1211
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:55,760
you can prove from the previous theorem

1212
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:59,359
or follows fairly easily. Uh so I claim

1213
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:02,000
that a graph has

1214
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:05,480
an open

1215
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,480
oiler walk.

1216
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:12,720
Open here just means not closed.

1217
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,400
So we've already characterized the

1218
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,280
situation of closed or their walks.

1219
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,960
That's this theorem. That's the or tour.

1220
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,480
Uh so what's left is to characterize

1221
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,720
when there's an open order walk where

1222
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,599
you start and end at different vertices.

1223
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,920
So let's ignore let's suppose that we

1224
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:29,839
don't have a closed order walk but we do

1225
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,920
have an open one. I claim this is

1226
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:34,880
possible if and only if the graph is

1227
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:38,559
connected as before

1228
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:42,200
and exactly two vertices

1229
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,200
have odd degree.

1230
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:52,040
Intuitively

1231
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,480
those odd degree vertices are where you

1232
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:59,440
start and where you end. If you look at

1233
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,599
this example with this erased

1234
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,400
um I started here which had degree

1235
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:07,520
three. I walked around and I ended here

1236
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,200
which also had degree three. So the the

1237
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,799
odd degree is essentially to compensate

1238
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,799
for starting and ending at those

1239
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:14,559
vertices. And that turns out to be all

1240
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:16,079
you can do. So if you have a graph with

1241
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:19,040
all even degree vertices, then there's

1242
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:21,359
an oiler tour. And if you have a graph

1243
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:23,119
with two odd degree vertices, uh then

1244
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:25,839
there's an oiler walk. If you have more

1245
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:30,400
than two uh odd degree vertices, like

1246
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:34,040
here there's neither. What if I have one

1247
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,040
odd degree vertex?

1248
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,880
Yeah,

1249
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,799
that's impossible.

1250
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,480
That's impossible. What are you talking

1251
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:42,240
about? because the number of odd degree

1252
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,559
vertices is even. I think you probably

1253
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,319
showed that in recitation. Okay, so or

1254
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:49,200
even lecture I don't forget follows from

1255
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:51,359
the handshaking lema from lecture. Uh so

1256
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:54,480
those are your options.

1257
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:58,319
Cool. Uh let me sketch a proof of this

1258
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:02,040
and then I want to um go to the last

1259
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:02,040
topic which is trees.

1260
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:11,359
So uh I want to the the easy direction

1261
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,920
as before if you have an oiler walk

1262
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:17,119
you're still connected and if you do the

1263
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:20,240
counting right you can see the number of

1264
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:22,000
degree two vertices should be odd

1265
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,640
because

1266
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,559
uh it's just like this proof but now

1267
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,480
it's not symmetric. We can no longer do

1268
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:30,319
these things modulo okay which was

1269
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,240
really nice. every visit look the same

1270
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:34,000
because now there's a f there's v 0ero

1271
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:36,400
and vk are visited in a different way

1272
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,359
from every other vertex and just like we

1273
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:42,240
said before the last vertex uh the last

1274
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:44,160
visit has only one edge coming into it

1275
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,839
so that makes this one odd and the first

1276
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,839
vertex has only one edge going out of it

1277
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:50,799
so it makes that vertex odd so this is

1278
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:52,240
sort of easy

1279
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:54,880
proof is in the notes if you're

1280
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:57,039
interested uh the interesting part is

1281
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,720
the other direction

1282
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:02,760
uh I mean this is

1283
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,760
roughly as before.

1284
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:07,359
Okay, let's suppose that we have exactly

1285
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,359
two vertices of odd degree. I want to

1286
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:11,119
claim there's an open oiler walk and I

1287
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:14,240
want to do it without repeating this

1288
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:15,520
giant proof. That's a lot of work to I

1289
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,039
mean you could repeat it and be more

1290
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,559
careful and you can prove the oiler walk

1291
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:21,599
thing but in fact there's a way to

1292
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:23,520
convert this problem into the oiler tour

1293
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:26,160
problem. So I'm going to do it by

1294
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:28,720
picture. Suppose you have a graph and

1295
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,319
you have two vertices U and V which are

1296
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:32,319
odd

1297
01:04:30,319 --> 01:04:33,839
degree.

1298
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:37,200
Maybe they're also just odd in general,

1299
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:39,280
but they're odd degree. Uh, and now I'm

1300
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,160
going to modify the graph. I'm going to

1301
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:45,200
construct a new graph G prime. So this

1302
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:49,280
graph that I drew is G

1303
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:53,359
here. And in G prime,

1304
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:58,640
I'm going to add a new vertex X and two

1305
01:04:53,359 --> 01:05:01,760
edges from U to X and X to V.

1306
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:04,400
Why did I do that?

1307
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:07,839
Because now all the degrees are even,

1308
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:10,480
right? In G, the degree of U was odd.

1309
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:13,280
And in G prime, it's one larger. So now

1310
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:16,079
it's even. Same for V. And X has degree

1311
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:23,200
two. So now everything's even. So that

1312
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:25,599
means uh G prime has an oiler tour

1313
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:27,200
by the previous.

1314
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:29,039
So that was I don't have to repeat the

1315
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:32,160
proof. It just I can apply the theorem

1316
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:35,039
as a whole. And now I want to convert

1317
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,640
this tour

1318
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:41,960
uh

1319
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,960
into an order walk in G.

1320
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:51,760
How do I do that? I just erase these two

1321
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:55,680
edges. Okay, the oiler tour visits every

1322
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:57,839
edge in G prime exactly once and it's a

1323
01:05:55,680 --> 01:06:00,480
loop. So in particular at some point it

1324
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:01,920
crosses over let's say from U to X and

1325
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,480
then it can't go back along the same

1326
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,760
edge because you can't repeat edges. So

1327
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,079
then it has to go, let's say it goes

1328
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:11,839
from U to X to V or it might go from V

1329
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:14,960
to X to U at some point in the

1330
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:19,359
in the closed walk, right, in the tour.

1331
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:22,240
Um, and when it does that, I want to uh

1332
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:24,720
instead in instead of going uh from

1333
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:27,039
somewhere to U to X to V, I'm going to

1334
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:29,839
start at V and then I'm going to keep

1335
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:31,520
going along the tour until I get back to

1336
01:06:29,839 --> 01:06:33,680
U.

1337
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:37,039
And that will include everything in the

1338
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:38,880
tour except for uh these two edges. And

1339
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:41,920
so that actually will be an oiler walk

1340
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,240
in G. So I maybe went a little fast

1341
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:47,119
there, but hopefully that's fairly

1342
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:50,240
intuitive. This is a very powerful idea

1343
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:52,480
called reduction where you take your

1344
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,839
problem that you want to solve and you

1345
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,839
convert it into a problem that you

1346
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:58,400
already know how to solve. So we already

1347
01:06:55,839 --> 01:07:00,960
we just solved oiler tours and now we

1348
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:03,520
wanted to solve open oiler walks and we

1349
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,839
could do it by adding augmenting the

1350
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,359
graph a little bit applying the theorem

1351
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:08,720
and then we need to make sure that what

1352
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:10,559
the result from that theorem is actually

1353
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,720
good enough for what we need. We can

1354
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:15,599
convert our order tour into an order

1355
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:17,520
walk. Uh but because tours are are

1356
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:20,079
cyclic in nature you can sort of rotate

1357
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:23,119
it to start at V, keep going and visit

1358
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:24,880
everything and end at U. Cool. So that

1359
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:27,359
also proves that you start and end at

1360
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,599
the two odd degree vertices in G, which

1361
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:32,599
is nice.

1362
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,599
Questions.

1363
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:39,160
All right,

1364
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,160
let's go back to

1365
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:48,720
back to trees.

1366
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:52,319
So we talked about walks, paths, cycles,

1367
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:56,200
connectivity, order things and last

1368
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:56,200
topic is trees.

1369
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,200
That's a very sad board.

1370
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:10,470
[Applause]

1371
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,520
Uh, I guess now for something completely

1372
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:25,359
different. Now we know how to draw

1373
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:27,279
graphs without raising our pen. Uh,

1374
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:29,440
define something called a tree, which

1375
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:32,159
you've probably heard the word tree many

1376
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,640
times in the past. Not just nature

1377
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:36,159
trees, but also computer science trees

1378
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,960
are all over the place. Like your

1379
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:40,880
directory tree, your I don't know, there

1380
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,799
trees everywhere. If you've done any

1381
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:46,359
data structures, you know about trees,

1382
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:46,359
tree data structures.

1383
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:52,839
So what is the mathematical notion of a

1384
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,839
tree?

1385
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,319
It's a graph. It's and again today uh

1386
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,960
we're always simple undirected graphs

1387
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:07,199
and trees always require that. Uh it's a

1388
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:12,319
graph that is both connected and as

1389
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:14,319
cyclic. As cyclic just means no cycles.

1390
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:16,960
What's a cycle? It's been a while.

1391
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:19,440
Remember, a cycle is a closed path of

1392
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,359
positive length. So, it doesn't repeat

1393
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,799
any vertices or edges except that the

1394
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,400
very first vertex equals the last

1395
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,920
vertex.

1396
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,319
Okay?

1397
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,359
So, if there are no cycles, there's no

1398
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:35,040
way to do this, then we call it a tree.

1399
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:38,040
And some examples of trees

1400
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,040
Sure.

1401
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:44,359
Just a path is a tree.

1402
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:50,319
This is a special kind of tree we call a

1403
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:51,520
star. One vertex connected to a bunch of

1404
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:53,359
things. In general, it looks something

1405
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,880
like this. Okay, this if you've seen

1406
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:57,520
computer science trees, these can be a

1407
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:59,120
little bit different. Uh, so the only

1408
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:00,719
thing requiring here is that they're

1409
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:02,400
connected. So this is a tree. This is a

1410
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:04,159
tree, but together this is not a tree.

1411
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:05,679
It's actually what we call a forest.

1412
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:07,760
This would be a forest with three trees

1413
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:11,199
in it. Uh or individually, these are

1414
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:14,480
each a tree graph.

1415
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:16,880
Okay. Um

1416
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:20,600
let's prove some properties about trees

1417
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,600
because they're so useful,

1418
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:29,880
just nice to work with.

1419
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:36,239
In particular, there's a very useful

1420
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:41,239
notion about trees called leaves.

1421
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:41,239
You can guess where this came from

1422
01:10:42,159 --> 01:10:48,159
from real trees. But uh the idea is a uh

1423
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,920
it's very simple. Just a leaf is a

1424
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:53,040
vertex of degree one. You can apply this

1425
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,560
to any uh graph. Sometimes you have

1426
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:59,040
vertices degree one, sometimes you

1427
01:10:54,560 --> 01:11:02,320
don't. But trees have leaves. Shocking

1428
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:04,320
news. Uh so this is I'll call it the

1429
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:07,199
leaf lema.

1430
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:09,280
It's not quite true that all trees have

1431
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:13,440
leaves. Uh you know they have to start

1432
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:18,719
growing for a little while first. Uh

1433
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:23,040
and in mathematics this is every tree of

1434
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:27,080
um I guess width is better

1435
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,080
at least two vertices

1436
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:36,880
has at least two leaves.

1437
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:39,360
So as long as your graph as long as your

1438
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,719
tree is not this graph. Okay, maybe I'll

1439
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:44,320
add it to my list of examples. These

1440
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:47,760
were all trees. Also, single vertex is a

1441
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:49,760
tree, but it doesn't have any edges and

1442
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:51,920
has degree zero vertex. No degree one

1443
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,320
vertices. Okay, so other than this

1444
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,400
exceptional case, every other tree has

1445
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,080
at least two leaves. Okay, where are the

1446
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,159
leaves in these graphs? Uh, here's a

1447
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:03,280
leaf. Here's a leaf. Here's a leaf.

1448
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:06,239
Here's a leaf. This one just has two.

1449
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:08,159
This one has a whole bunch of leaves.

1450
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:10,560
Okay,

1451
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:12,080
let's

1452
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:16,040
uh

1453
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:16,040
sketch a proof of this llama

1454
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:22,159
which is a familiar technique. Take a

1455
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,840
longest

1456
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:26,640
something. In this case, the something

1457
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:28,159
is path. Okay, remember a path is a walk

1458
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,560
that doesn't repeat any vertices or

1459
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:33,120
edges. So, I want to take a longest path

1460
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:37,360
in one of these graphs. For example, uh

1461
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:40,000
if I take this, this turns out to be a

1462
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:42,800
longest path in this graph. It's length

1463
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,880
four. I believe you cannot find a path

1464
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,440
of length five. Here you can find walks

1465
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,800
that are arbitrarily long, but paths you

1466
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:52,159
can only find length four in this

1467
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:54,719
particular graph. I claim that the first

1468
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:58,199
vertex and the last vertex in that path

1469
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,199
must be leaves.

1470
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:04,199
So ends

1471
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:04,199
must be leaves

1472
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:09,159
and they must be distinct.

1473
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:15,120
Okay, why are they distinct? Well, uh

1474
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:17,280
this is a path and path can't repeat

1475
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,600
vertices. So unless the path has length

1476
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:22,000
zero, uh the start vertex and the end

1477
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,760
vertex are different. Okay, it's not

1478
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,679
length zero basically because we're not

1479
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,360
in this case. In this case, there's no

1480
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,640
edges. You can't follow anything. But as

1481
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,760
long as there's at least one edge, then

1482
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:32,159
you know there is a path of length at

1483
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:34,320
least one. And so the start vertex and

1484
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,679
and the end vertex will be different.

1485
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:38,560
And furthermore, I claim they must be

1486
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:40,640
leaves. Basically, if this wasn't if

1487
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,880
this vertex didn't have degree one, so

1488
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:45,120
there wasn't just this one way to exit,

1489
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:46,480
there'd be another edge incident to that

1490
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,920
vertex. And then you could have made a

1491
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:51,920
longer path. So a contradiction.

1492
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:56,520
Okay, I'm going to call it there. And

1493
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:56,520
you can read the notes for more details.

1494
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,520
And instead I'm going to tell you what

1495
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,679
you can do with these leaves. Why are

1496
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,679
they useful?

1497
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:13,239
Every tree except the one vertex tree

1498
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,239
has a leaf.

1499
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,280
And if you've ever taken care of a

1500
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:20,159
plant, you know sometimes it's useful to

1501
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:23,199
prune the plant. Grows better. In our

1502
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:26,199
case, pruning is a very useful

1503
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:26,199
operation.

1504
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:33,679
that lets us use induction.

1505
01:14:30,159 --> 01:14:36,080
We've seen some inductions for graphs

1506
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:41,320
and trees are really nice to induct on

1507
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:41,320
because they have leaves to trim.

1508
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:53,360
So this is a theorem for any leaf L in a

1509
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:57,600
tree T

1510
01:14:53,360 --> 01:15:00,960
minus L is a tree.

1511
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:03,440
Okay. What what is T minus L? This is

1512
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:06,960
the graph

1513
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:12,239
induced by

1514
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:13,840
uh all the vertices minus L.

1515
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:15,920
So in other words, it's the graph you

1516
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:19,600
get if you take the tree and you clip

1517
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:21,280
off the leaf and its incident edge.

1518
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,199
This is that's the negative version. The

1519
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:25,840
positive version is you say I keep

1520
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:27,840
everything except L

1521
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,520
and I take all the edges among those

1522
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,320
vertices that do not include L. that

1523
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:36,239
will end up having uh let's call this t

1524
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:39,040
prime. Uh the number of edges in t prime

1525
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:41,280
is going to be one less than the number

1526
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:44,560
of edges in t. And the number of

1527
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:46,960
vertices is also going to be one less

1528
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,679
because we removed one vertex and one

1529
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:54,159
edge. So here's our tree. Uh here's a

1530
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:57,280
here's a leaf. This whole picture is t

1531
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:59,520
and this inner picture is t prime. Okay,

1532
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:04,000
this is a leaf L.

1533
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:06,239
So T prime or T minus L is this smaller

1534
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,920
thing. Okay, useful thing in general. If

1535
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:10,560
you remove a vertex from a graph, you

1536
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,239
also remove all of its incident edges.

1537
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:15,600
Okay, so this is a thing which is pretty

1538
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:18,080
easy to prove. Uh if because what we're

1539
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:21,040
saying is suppose that T is connected as

1540
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:22,800
cyclic, the claim is that T prime is

1541
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:26,159
also connected and a cyclic. And you can

1542
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:28,400
just show um that that's true. It's not

1543
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:30,880
very hard.

1544
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:32,640
Again, see the notes.

1545
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,199
And what this enables to do together,

1546
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:37,520
the leaf lama and this tree pruning lema

1547
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:41,440
let you do induction over trees in a

1548
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:43,040
really nice way. So let's argue let's

1549
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:46,560
see an example of that with something

1550
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:49,040
called the size of the tree.

1551
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:53,080
Any tree

1552
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,080
with n vertices

1553
01:16:53,440 --> 01:17:00,000
has n minus one edges.

1554
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:02,560
Always.

1555
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,640
If you look at these examples,

1556
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:09,920
the one vertex tree has zero edges. The

1557
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:13,360
four vertex path has three edges. The

1558
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:16,239
six vertex star has five edges. This

1559
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:18,480
thing has one fewer edge than vertices.

1560
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:19,280
I won't count.

1561
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,719
So, there are three kinds of

1562
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:23,280
mathematicians in the world. Those who

1563
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:29,000
can count and those who can't.

1564
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:29,000
All right. So, I'm the latter kind.

1565
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,120
So, finally we get to an induction. We

1566
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:36,400
haven't done induction all day. It's

1567
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:39,679
terrible. Finally, we can do induction.

1568
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:41,040
Um, so we're gonna remember whenever you

1569
01:17:39,679 --> 01:17:42,800
do an induction over graphs, you're

1570
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,120
really just doing regular induction or

1571
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:46,400
strong induction over numbers. And so in

1572
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:48,480
this case, we're going to induct over

1573
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,719
the number of vertices in the graph. So

1574
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:54,800
our induction hypothesis is this that

1575
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:56,960
for a number n, p of n

1576
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,920
is this statement that any tree with n

1577
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:03,960
vertices has exactly n minus one edges.

1578
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,960
I should write exactly here.

1579
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,520
Okay. And we're going to prove it by

1580
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,280
induction. So we probably need a base

1581
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,960
case.

1582
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:15,040
What is the smallest possible thing that

1583
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:16,800
n can be? Uh one. Remember we forbid

1584
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,120
zero vert vertex graphs. You have to

1585
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,840
have at least one vertex to be a graph.

1586
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:24,159
So in n equals one that means there's

1587
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:28,600
only one graph with n equals one and it

1588
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:28,600
has zero edges. Great.

1589
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:35,120
My my vertex looks a lot like my number

1590
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:37,440
zero. Sorry. Um okay. So let's do the

1591
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:39,120
induction step. Now we're going to use

1592
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:42,400
all of these beautiful lemas that we

1593
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:45,360
have about leaves.

1594
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:48,640
So let's suppose that n is bigger than

1595
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:50,560
one. In other words, n is at least two.

1596
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:52,480
And therefore, the leaf lema applies. It

1597
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,640
says if you have n at least two, you

1598
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:58,400
have at least two leaves. I actually

1599
01:18:54,640 --> 01:19:03,000
only need one of them. Uh but let's say

1600
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:03,000
by leaf lema

1601
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:09,840
there exists a leaf and let's call it l.

1602
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:12,719
Okay. Now I'm gonna apply this pruning

1603
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:15,920
this tree pruning lema that says if I

1604
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:20,239
now I have a leaf I can remove it clip

1605
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:23,040
it take the a new graph T prime which is

1606
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:28,120
everything in T except L.

1607
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:28,120
Okay. So by tree pruning

1608
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:37,000
T prime which is T minus L is a tree.

1609
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,600
Not only is it a tree, it's a smaller

1610
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,600
tree.

1611
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:48,920
It has exactly n minus one vertices.

1612
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:55,440
Okay. So I can apply induction

1613
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,679
because when in our induction step we

1614
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:59,440
get to assume that this property is true

1615
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:01,199
for all smaller n that's strong

1616
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:04,800
induction in particular it's true for n

1617
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:08,000
minus one that's weak induction. Uh so

1618
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:12,000
by the induction hypothesis

1619
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:14,000
uh we know that t prime

1620
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,800
uh has

1621
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:20,400
uh one fewer edge than vertex and it has

1622
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:24,679
n minus one vertices and so it has n

1623
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,679
minus2 edges

1624
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:30,320
and t prime was everything in t except

1625
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:32,560
for one edge that measly edge connected

1626
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:36,640
to l.

1627
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:42,199
So uh t has

1628
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:42,199
one more edge than t prime.

1629
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:51,520
So it has uh n minus one edges and

1630
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:53,760
that's what we needed to show.

1631
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:56,000
Okay, this is very nice for inducting

1632
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,679
over trees. Uh the idea is if you have a

1633
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,719
tree, you're going to do induction, you

1634
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:02,719
should take a leaf and prune it. Usually

1635
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:03,920
that's what you want to do. Sometimes

1636
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:05,679
it's useful to know there's two of them.

1637
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:07,360
You could take any vertex and remove it,

1638
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:09,040
but if I took a vertex in the middle of

1639
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,480
my tree, it might disconnect into

1640
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:12,800
multiple trees and then I have to do a

1641
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:14,480
lot more work. By choosing a leaf, when

1642
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,719
I remove it, I guarantee I'm still a

1643
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:20,640
tree and so I can still apply induction.

1644
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:23,120
It was very helpful. Uh that's uh lots

1645
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:25,600
of fun things about trees. Um it turns

1646
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:28,159
out the reverse is true. If you have any

1647
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:32,000
connected graph with one fewer edge than

1648
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:33,760
vertex, it must be a tree. Uh trees also

1649
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,400
have unique paths between any two

1650
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,480
vertices and any graph that has unique

1651
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:42,480
paths between any two vertices is a

1652
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:45,480
tree. Uh other fun things like they're

1653
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:45,480
the

1654
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:50,320
minimal connected graphs or maximal

1655
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,239
asyclic graphs. Lots of fun properties

1656
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:54,400
which you can find in the notes or the

1657
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:58,280
textbook. That's it for trees. Next time

1658
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,280
we'll do directed graphs.
