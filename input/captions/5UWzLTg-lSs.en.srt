1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,799
I first got a chance of taking video

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,359
tips of my undergraduate freshman class

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,679
to put on open courseware and in the

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,360
first minute so many people get to watch

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,080
the videos and you're like oh this is

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,960
great more people than I will ever teach

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,720
in person. When MITx came on and we

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,199
could use the same video to structure

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,840
something with deeper engagement, I was

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,439
even more excited by that because I felt

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,160
I can basically now almost teach the

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,640
same way. The MIT students that I teach

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,640
in person watch the same video as the

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,280
online people and basically take the

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,200
class and then they come to class and

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,800
they do something else with it. And the

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,800
people in the world, they watch this

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,559
video and presumably they also use it in

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,079
a part of their life that's a different

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:54,760
part. For more MIT moments from MIT Open
