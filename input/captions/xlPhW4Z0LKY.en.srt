1
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,520
Don't start small. Start with what you

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,920
have. At the start, nothing is new.

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,520
Often not even the idea. The origins of

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,160
the Greenpeace Foundation illustrates

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,519
this point really well. Greenpeace

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
changed how we think about the

7
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,840
environment. That was their innovation.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,320
The founders of Greenpeace got started

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,960
by trying to stop the United States from

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,760
testing a nuclear bomb or with a fishing

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,160
boat. They got everyone's attention.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,239
This was certainly a bold idea. It was

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,320
also not new. The Golden Rule Expedition

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,239
had tried the exact same thing 10 years

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,600
earlier and the founders of Greenpeace

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,600
knew about it. The Golden Rule was the

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,680
name of the boat another group of people

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,160
had tried to use to stop the United

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,760
States from testing nuclear bombs. There

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,160
are many more examples of innovations

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,960
born out of repurposing old ideas.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,519
Blockchain, the laser, Tesla, Ford's

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,760
affordable car, biotechnology, all

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,760
started out as a combination of things

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,200
that were not new. You can find more

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,280
about these and others in the first two

27
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,119
chapters of my book, Innovating Adors

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,159
Manifesto, and in the other materials I

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,759
have shared online. This gives you a new

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,479
way to think about innovating as

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,560
reshaping and repurposing old ideas and

32
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,159
technologies. In fact, because one

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
technology can lead to many ventures,

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,000
and there are multiple ways to chip at a

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,600
problem, you do not even need to come up

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
with that great an idea. You can go

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,799
looking for things that someone else

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,560
left half finished. Technologies on the

39
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,880
shelf or ideas that did not pan out the

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,320
first time around and start big. This is

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,159
a bit of a mental shift from how we

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,040
imagine innovation. We tend to believe

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,560
that innovations have to start small.

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,720
That's because the emphasis is on the

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,119
word new, which everyone associates with

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,960
unproven. But if all you're going to use

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,040
is old, this frees you to think about

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,600
how you start in a different way. You

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,159
can start big as big as your current

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,680
resources allow you to. The reason why I

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,000
put the emphasis on starting with what

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,479
you have is to make you realize that you

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,840
do not need to start small. Of course,

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,319
I'm not asking you to put your entire

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,000
fortune into one single project, but I'm

56
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,760
inviting you to consider what's the

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,840
right amount of resources to demonstrate

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,599
what you want to do. Whether you start

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,280
from a hunch about a problem like the

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,720
founders of Greenpeace did with a

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,120
well-ressearched technology coming from

62
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,879
a lab or any in between, repurposing

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,959
ideas and technologies and starting with

64
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,879
what you have is how you chip at the

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,720
problem. You might still wonder about

66
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,440
how to start, when to seek more

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,210
resources, and how much. More on that in

68
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:42,110
the next video.
