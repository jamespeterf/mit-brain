00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,720
good morning everyone welcome to the mpg

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:09,920
primer um we're excited to have Evan kot

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,440
here today Evan is a research associate

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,440
in the sun Lab at the department of

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,800
medical or biomedical informatics at

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,720
Harvard Medical School he applies

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,359
theoretical and empirical population

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,599
genetics approaches to better understand

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,359
mutagenesis variant function and how

10
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,679
natural selection shapes genetic

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,840
variation and complex trait he also

12
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,120
co-chairs an evolutionary focus group at

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,360
the nih's impact of genomic variation on

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,320
function the igf

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,039
Consortium and aside from Human genetics

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,680
research he also involves himself in

17
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:46,760
research on Wolf arabidopsis and various

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,280
pathogens he receives his PhD in ecology

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,600
and evolution from the University of

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,160
Chicago in 2018 and he was advi advised

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,039
by John November and Richard Hudson um

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,879
and today he's going to be talking about

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,840
uh introduction to population genetics

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,359
and please raise your hand or come up to

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,840
this mic I could bring one to you or you

26
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:07,439
could come here to ask questions

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,439
throughout or at the end

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,720
thanks thank you um yeah so I'm going to

29
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,080
give an introduction to population

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,840
genetics briefly um you know because

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,720
it's only a field that's you know been

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,360
around now for a bit over a century so

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,960
we should be able to cover everything um

34
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,000
and you know this is parenthesis here

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,200
model so there's a lot of amazing

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,600
empirical findings but I'm going to

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,560
focus on the models because I believe

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,240
that you know this provides really the

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:40,079
based understanding um that we try to

40
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,520
get when we look at uh genetic data from

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,680
populations yeah so we're going to hit

42
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,560
really three topics today um starting

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,759
with genetic drift as also sort of an

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,799
introduction into modeling a population

45
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,119
generally um then go on to Natural

46
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,600
Selection and in particular um negative

47
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,880
selection partly because this is you

48
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,759
know what I actually tend to work on

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,560
most of the time and and also because

50
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,800
it's the one that's most ubiquitous in

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,080
your

52
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,360
genome um and then we'll talk about

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,480
colesent the colesent and gen

54
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,959
genealogies um as like a sample focused

55
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,760
uh view of of genetic variation and

56
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,959
ancestry and touch a bit on the

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,480
ancestral recombination graph um as like

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,560
maybe a bit of a Hot Topic at the moment

59
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,120
and then briefly touch on uh the extra

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,319
treat of the selective sweeps in the

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,840
genome and then you know if there's time

62
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,800
at the end I'll go over a little bit

63
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,120
about some tools and

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:45,159
resources okay so to start at the

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,120
absolute uh very basic um place of

66
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,840
genetic drift and genetic variation in

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,239
population so right you know you could

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:57,480
have at one position in the genome here

69
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:00,159
um two possible alals let's say um A and

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,800
G and what we talk about most of of the

71
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,440
time in in population genetics is the

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,920
frequency of those leals the the how

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,720
common they are in the population as a

74
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,680
whole um so if you had a population

75
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,599
let's say of n dipl individuals um we

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,360
would just simply calculate uh the

77
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,879
frequency of of the of the G um by you

78
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,200
know the number of of haloid genomes

79
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:27,599
that that carry that Al and so for this

80
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,599
talk I'll I'll denote the frequency of

81
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,519
of an Al as uh p and then the frequency

82
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:37,400
of the uh alternate or referenc will

83
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:41,159
always be one minus P okay

84
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,680
so then let's let's think about a

85
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,959
population and this is not you know a

86
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,799
very large or realistic population maybe

87
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,640
but let's say you have some number of

88
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,799
diploid individuals and each of those

89
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,840
individuals is going to have uh a

90
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,239
genotype being you know either what of

91
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,159
the homozygote or the heterozygote

92
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:04,560
genotypes and we can then ask what the

93
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:08,400
frequency simply of of ourg is um is in

94
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,640
that generation right then those um

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,439
individuals can can pair up and produce

96
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,680
some number of Offspring denoted here in

97
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,799
the the second generation as as their

98
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,560
children and and given that we can

99
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:24,199
simply follow um melian segregation to

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,680
you know this is an inherently random

101
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,320
process to choose genotypes in the Next

102
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,240
Generation and so this combination

103
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,080
of you know variation in the number of

104
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,919
offspring that uh that parents are going

105
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,919
to have uh as well as the inherent

106
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:43,360
variation due to melan segregation are

107
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,840
going to mean that the frequency of that

108
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,800
geol is not exactly the same in this

109
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,199
next Generation as it was in the

110
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,720
previous and this is really what we mean

111
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,440
by genetic drift that there's these

112
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,880
inherent uh factors to U melan

113
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,600
segregation and breeding structure of

114
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,880
populations that leads to variation

115
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,720
uh in Al frequencies over

116
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,840
time right so how do we want to now we

117
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,360
want to actually model this what are we

118
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,000
supposed to do one option would be to

119
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,520
try to be uh realistic and actually

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,720
specify what the pedigree or some

121
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,360
pedigree generating processes in the

122
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,800
population this is an example of a

123
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,759
couple of wolf packs in in Northern

124
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,000
Italy and researchers have gone out and

125
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,400
actually mapped out uh their pedigree

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,160
which is great but as you can maybe see

127
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,960
from this it is enormously complicated

128
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,120
and it would be a ton of work to

129
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,560
actually model or or measure this for

130
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,319
every population we want to look at and

131
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,120
mostly impossible but we could do that

132
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,560
and then simply follow melan laws to see

133
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,080
how a Leal frequencies

134
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,199
change um we're not going to do that

135
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:54,440
that's way too hard um but what we will

136
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,800
do uh is come up with a simple model of

137
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,840
of reproduction uh that we can actually

138
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,280
work with and there's a couple of these

139
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,919
that are tractable and have you know a

140
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,319
lot of work done on them but the most

141
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,039
common is probably What's called the

142
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,720
right Fisher model and so that states

143
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:14,840
okay we have some population of n

144
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,880
diploids um at at generation p and then

145
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,680
we're going to choose a next gener a

146
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,400
next um a next generation of individuals

147
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,319
at time step t+ one so this is discrete

148
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,039
Generations um and then each of these

149
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,039
individuals in the Next Generation needs

150
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,360
you know two copies of their genome two

151
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,720
copies of this alal and they're going to

152
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,400
sample it at random from uh from the

153
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,160
individuals in the previous generation

154
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,000
and therefore we have you know the

155
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,840
variation variance in the number of aals

156
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,319
is simply going to be binomial uh

157
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,240
distribution um with you know simply the

158
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,840
the probability of getting that Al equal

159
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,360
to the the probability that it was in

160
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,080
the previous generation and there's

161
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,639
going to be no average change in alal

162
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,440
frequencies no directional change um the

163
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,520
expectation of this is going to be zero

164
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,479
but you're going to have this genetic

165
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,840
drift um due to that sampling

166
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,599
process now if we instead calculate the

167
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,120
variance in the change in Al

168
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:18,879
frequencies um this is going to be equal

169
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,440
to P times 1 minus p over the uh over

170
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,440
the deploy twice the deploy population

171
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,440
size right so we can you know just from

172
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,039
this very very simple model make a um

173
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,440
sort of qualitative statement about how

174
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,360
drift should work um it should be faster

175
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,840
in small populations when that n is

176
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,199
small and it and it should be um also

177
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,120
faster at high minor alal frequency so

178
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,479
drift will that variance and alal

179
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,199
frequency change will be fastest when

180
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,280
the alal frequencies is around

181
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,479
50% uh but what should we make of real

182
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,479
populations we don't want to do the

183
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,720
complicated thing and think about

184
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,360
pedigrees all the time uh we don't

185
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,720
actually believe that like a right

186
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,000
Fisher model is an appropriate one for

187
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,840
like the human population um so what's

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,520
commonly done is to try to make an

189
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,360
analogy between the drift that occurs in

190
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,000
idealized populations like this right

191
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,720
Fisher one um and real populations that

192
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,960
might exist in the wild and by matching

193
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,120
the rate of genetic drift and so we

194
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,960
introduced this quantity uh called the

195
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,280
effective population size or NE uh and

196
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,639
we want to choose the effective

197
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,639
population size such that the variance

198
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,599
in a Leal frequency from one gener

199
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,959
duration uh to the next matches this uh

200
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,880
this equation for the binomial sampling

201
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:39,360
and the right Fisher model um where

202
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,680
we've substituted an effective

203
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,360
population size instead now one aspect

204
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,920
of this is that you know when we're

205
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,360
choosing some alternative model some

206
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,120
real you know model that we think is

207
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,320
maybe more realistic trying to analogize

208
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,920
that to right Fisher ones the variance

209
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,920
needs to actually be proportional to P1

210
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,880
minus P for an effective population size

211
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,120
to exist thankfully that's like largely

212
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,959
the case but it's something you might

213
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,959
consider

214
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,800
consider um great so let's maybe take a

215
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:10,240
silly example of this um and think about

216
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,120
some model where you have a distribution

217
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,839
of family sizes sort of similar to what

218
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,240
I what I showed previously um this this

219
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,760
model over here with a variance of two

220
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,839
is going to be approximately um equal to

221
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,279
what you would see in the right Fisher

222
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,680
model but you might have populations

223
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,079
with you know a lower variance or you

224
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,320
know a much higher skew in the the

225
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:35,480
family size that um individuals might

226
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,160
have and if you you know say set the the

227
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,440
number of individuals in the population

228
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,240
to be constant and simulate alal

229
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,600
frequency sampling generation after

230
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,720
generation we can see that you know

231
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,680
indeed the the drift in these alal

232
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,720
frequencies increases with that variance

233
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,680
in family size as we might expect

234
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,240
intuitively and then you know in in

235
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,560
mathematical terms we can say that the

236
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,920
effective population size um and should

237
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,399
be four times the

238
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,120
the diploid size um over the this

239
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,680
variance in family size and a

240
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,000
contribution um to Mel from melan

241
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,360
segregation uh interestingly you could e

242
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,040
this also you know uh illustrates the

243
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,040
fact that even if the there is no

244
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,680
variant in family size you would still

245
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,600
get genetic drift uh in diploids just

246
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,680
from melan

247
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,519
segregation so then if we went through

248
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,519
and we actually scaled the population

249
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,240
sizes in each of these uh family size

250
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:34,720
models here so that they should have the

251
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,040
same effective population size you see

252
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,079
that indeed the the distribution of uh

253
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,360
alal frequencies after you know random

254
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,279
sampling one generation does actually

255
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,320
look very

256
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:51,000
similar okay so one thing that will

257
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,680
happen right we this sampling of AO

258
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
frequencies generation after generation

259
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,040
is that we let that go on for long

260
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,639
enough you're going to eventually remove

261
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,760
all the genetic variation from the

262
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:04,040
population and the AL are either going

263
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,760
to you know uh drop out of the

264
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,800
population go to a frequency of zero or

265
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,839
they might fix in the population and go

266
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,959
to a frequency of of one um now we know

267
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,680
that there is genetic variant variation

268
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,480
population so we need some mechanism to

269
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,399
add this back

270
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,000
in so that mechanism is is obviously uh

271
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,959
mutations which generate genetic

272
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,519
variation that then might be able to

273
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,519
drift up to higher frequencies and

274
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,480
maintain a balance between the addition

275
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,040
of genetic variation into population

276
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,600
mutation and drift which is going to

277
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,279
tend to remove it so then we're now

278
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,399
we're interested in questions of how

279
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,920
that genetic variation is maintained and

280
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:45,480
what is its distribution within

281
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,800
populations um this you know provides a

282
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,600
nice opportunity to introduce a second

283
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,519
approximation so we can think about this

284
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,920
right Fisher model we want to get it

285
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,240
even simpler actually so we're going to

286
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,279
now approximate that alal frequencies

287
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,839
aren't this like count in the population

288
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:02,160
we say okay well they're actually

289
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,040
approximately uh continuous which unless

290
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,639
you're a very very rare alal is is going

291
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,240
to be pretty good A population which is

292
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,120
some similar to saying the population

293
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,320
size is large and this diffusion

294
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,839
approximation the Dynamics of those Alo

295
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,959
frequencies are only really going to

296
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,760
depend on um the expected change in AO

297
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,320
frequency per generation and the

298
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,040
variance in AO frequency um change and

299
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,480
as we've already seen we already know

300
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,600
what the Varian is it's this P1 minus p

301
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,519
over the effective population

302
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,600
size um so now you can apply this

303
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,279
diffusion model and say you know

304
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,880
starting with some continuous

305
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:38,880
distribution of alal frequencies at

306
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,320
whatever starting point you want go an

307
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,360
arbitrary number of generations into the

308
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,760
future um and get what's going to happen

309
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,880
uh to that

310
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,600
distribution um we're going to call that

311
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,720
distribution of AAL frequencies um Tai

312
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,600
here and what's going to happen is

313
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,360
you're going to lose uh you're going to

314
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,240
lose alals at the zero and one

315
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,680
boundaries and that distribution is

316
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,959
going to flatten out as well and this

317
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,760
Evolution happens according to this

318
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,360
diffusion equation here which you don't

319
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,399
really need to think too much about

320
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,079
right now for the purposes of this talk

321
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,440
but you can see that it depends on this

322
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:16,040
expected and variance um in the alal

323
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,720
frequency change as well as what the

324
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,920
shape of the pop of the genetic

325
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,279
variation is at the given point in time

326
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,600
okay uh yeah so now if we ask for okay

327
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,639
what if we come to this balance we come

328
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,320
to this equilibrium what is the uh

329
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,079
distribution of genetic variation going

330
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,399
to look like and so we can add mutation

331
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:39,399
back and forth uh between our our two Al

332
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,040
set a mutation rate here uh is the rate

333
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:44,880
per gamet per per generation and then

334
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,720
the expected change in a Leo frequency

335
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,120
um uh is going to be mu this per

336
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,959
generation mutation rate as one minus 2p

337
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,079
and so you know at the boundaries you

338
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,600
know if that alil isn't actually present

339
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:58,279
in the population mutation's always

340
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,199
going to add it rate VI to to the

341
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:02,440
population

342
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:04,920
um and this is the the distribution uh

343
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,440
that one gets it depends only on a

344
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,120
compound parameter which we call uh

345
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,839
Theta which is sort of like

346
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,959
the a parameter um capturing what the

347
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,079
neutral genetic diversity should be in

348
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:19,680
the in the population and that depends

349
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,560
on the product of the effective

350
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,560
population size in the mutation

351
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,759
rate we can also see that most variants

352
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,959
are going to be rare because when you

353
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,720
get a a variant added to the population

354
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:34,079
by by mutation uh the most likely thing

355
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,440
that's going to occur to it is that it

356
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,720
will then just subsequently pretty

357
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,360
quickly be lost but some amount of the

358
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,480
time variants are going to drift up to

359
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,079
to high frequencies and you know add

360
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,639
this real genetic variation to the

361
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,399
population that affects things like uh

362
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,480
complex traits and and all other kinds

363
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,120
of good

364
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,440
stuff um now complicating things just a

365
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,720
little bit further this is maybe in the

366
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,639
previous slide a model for a single site

367
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,680
gen are are large and we don't

368
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,680
necessarily want to model it sight by

369
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,880
sight all the time so one trick that

370
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,519
that that can be do that we can do is um

371
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,600
use what's called an infinite sites

372
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:15,240
model and so now we have this stretch of

373
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,240
genome here and at each site there's

374
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,279
going to be um some ancestral Al

375
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,120
mutations are going to create um new

376
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,240
derived alals at you know some positions

377
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,040
there and occasionally they're going to

378
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,040
drift up to to high frequencies and

379
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,000
you'll have some them pile within this

380
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,759
stretch of of Al at some appreciable

381
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
frequency in in the

382
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,199
population and so you know what you can

383
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,440
do is at any point in time take all of

384
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:45,199
those drive alals that are you know

385
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,920
segregating having these drift processes

386
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,839
um at each point in in our um in our

387
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,920
pile of sequence and add them all up and

388
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:56,480
ask what like sort of the aggregate

389
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,480
distribution of those Al frequencies is

390
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,199
and this is what's called maybe the alal

391
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,560
frequency

392
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:05,800
Spectrum uh s here um and that's you

393
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,040
know going to be the number of sites

394
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,519
that we've considered in our stretch

395
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,120
here um it's going to be proportional

396
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,079
the number of mutations that you're

397
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,560
going to see in each of these

398
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:18,639
frequencies proportional to this um

399
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,360
Theta this um sort of genetic variation

400
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,040
parameter and it's going to be

401
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:25,839
proportional to the inverse of the alal

402
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,560
frequency um right and so this you know

403
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,360
we're assume most mutations are rare

404
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,800
events so we can model this as a CR on

405
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,079
process and that the diffusions that

406
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,160
independent position different positions

407
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,240
are just going independently and so now

408
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,079
we can make really nice calculations

409
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,759
from this alal frequency spectrum object

410
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:42,600
such as just calculating what's the

411
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:45,319
expected number of derived alals we

412
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,240
would expect to see um in some frequency

413
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:49,600
range and that's going to be Pon

414
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,279
distributed with simply this you know

415
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,279
how much mass is there in this frequency

416
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,319
range according to this a frequency

417
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:59,639
spectrum

418
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,199
object um great so

419
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,440
now we have this model for these latent

420
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,480
alal frequencies in the population as a

421
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,319
whole but a lot of the time what we're

422
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,839
working with is a sample from the

423
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:13,799
population we've sampled some um uh some

424
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:15,959
genetic sequences right and and what

425
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,839
we're going to do is calculate What's

426
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,959
called the sample frequency spectrum or

427
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,880
the or the SFS um and so what's that

428
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,720
what we're going to do then is for each

429
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,360
possible count of alals in the

430
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,080
sample um see how many observations

431
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,880
we make at that count right so if we uh

432
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,600
sampled six sequences here we would

433
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,320
count up the number of Al that we saw at

434
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,280
a frequency of two um so you have two of

435
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,440
those here um the number at frequency

436
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,160
one and so on and so forth um and add

437
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,039
that all up um and ask how many times we

438
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,640
saw alals at each possible derived

439
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:59,400
count now we can develop a statistical

440
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,159
model of this of this SFS

441
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,200
using this alal frequency spectrum let's

442
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,440
say if we took a sample of n haid

443
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,440
individuals from the population simply

444
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,679
by applying like a binomial sampling

445
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,520
from that latent distribution of of Al

446
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:16,919
frequencies and this has the nice

447
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,559
property of being Plus on as well and so

448
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,360
you can make very simple calculations

449
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:24,360
just from having this alal frequency

450
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,320
spectrum object applying this binomial

451
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,960
sampling to it and then getting a model

452
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,200
for what the distribution of Alo

453
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,720
frequencies should be that you expect to

454
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,720
find in your sample from some population

455
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,640
with a particular frequency distribution

456
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,480
that looks something like this here this

457
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:43,480
um black line being the latent frequency

458
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,320
spectrum um and then these blue dots

459
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,520
being the expected um counts that you

460
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,200
would get in in a sample and so you know

461
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,480
if we've sampled um some variant and

462
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,799
found it at let's say frequency .5 in

463
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,919
the population we can ask simple things

464
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,440
like well what's the latent distribution

465
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:06,039
of Alo frequencies um that that uh that

466
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,200
that 50% uh Al actually represents and

467
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:09,600
there's actually you know for a sample

468
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,960
of size 10 um there's going to be quite

469
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,320
some some variance in that and this is

470
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,440
going to shrink as um that's going to

471
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,640
shrink as as your sample size gets

472
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,919
larger but you know you might also note

473
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,120
that for low frequency alals the a lot

474
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,480
of the mass of um what the latent alal

475
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,679
frequency is um is going to be

476
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,799
substantially lower than what you

477
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,320
actually saw in your sample and so

478
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,520
you're going to find those rare alals

479
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,080
that you kind of catch by accident in

480
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,080
your sample at a little bit higher

481
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,080
frequency um in real populations in

482
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:49,480
human populations let's say um the SFS

483
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:53,360
doesn't look like this one one over uh

484
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,039
one overp curve so here this is from

485
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,360
from

486
00:19:54,039 --> 00:20:01,000
Nomad um for non-finished European

487
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,919
individuals this um SFS object for

488
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,200
synonymous sites um and and here these

489
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,919
Dash lines show what would would expect

490
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,559
from uh this stable constant sized

491
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,679
population that we've just been talking

492
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,880
about and we can see that the the SFS is

493
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,280
a lot steeper you have an excess of rare

494
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,480
variants and it's very far from this

495
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,880
standal neutral SFS of one over

496
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,600
I um and this you know one way that this

497
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,960
happens and probably have other factors

498
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,600
that affect this as well is that um the

499
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,039
human population hasn't stayed constant

500
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,720
over over the past you know whatever

501
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,080
huge amount of time and so one thing

502
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:41,080
that people do is fit demographic models

503
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,720
using um using this site frequency

504
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:47,840
spectrum and so this is just one from

505
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,559
tennis and at all uh for for European

506
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,039
populations larly kind of trying to

507
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:55,320
approximate some sort of Out of Africa

508
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:56,960
events um you know so you have a assume

509
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:59,280
that there's some stable population size

510
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,400
at some long time in the past as denoted

511
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,320
by this dash line here and then evolving

512
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,280
that through a population siiz

513
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,559
trajectory generation after generation

514
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,640
in this diffusion model and then getting

515
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,960
what the what the Alo frequency spectrum

516
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,720
is at at the end of that whole thing and

517
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,640
that would be this black line here for

518
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,960
the for this Tennison model and so you

519
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,440
get like various features in here such

520
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,559
as this dip in genetic

521
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,159
diversity um due to Out of Africa

522
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:29,880
bottleneck as well as a large number of

523
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,120
of rare um of rare variance due to due

524
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,520
to population

525
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,640
growth and one thing I just want to sort

526
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,919
of impress you that all of this is my I

527
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,679
hope it doesn't sound too complicated

528
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,440
and please again interrupt me if you

529
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,799
have any questions um but it's actually

530
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,480
quite simple to to start doing

531
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,240
yourself um nicely with this program

532
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,000
daddy you can simply in Python set up a

533
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,120
frequency grid get your equilibrium

534
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,720
spectrum and evolve that Spectrum with

535
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,480
like one line of of code uh for some

536
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,960
number of generations and then ask what

537
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,200
a sample would look like and it's very

538
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,960
easy to start playing around with and

539
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,480
then you can start making calculations

540
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,960
for what you might expect in your sample

541
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,679
what might you expect from selection and

542
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,919
heritability contributions um and it's

543
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,440
very fast to do you don't need to do

544
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,559
complicated simulations you can get

545
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,159
these AAL frequency spectrums super

546
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:26,440
easily okay so now let's get on to to

547
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,240
Natural

548
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,279
Selection okay um so when you talk about

549
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,799
selection what we're talking about hey

550
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:36,919
Evan before uh you move on to your next

551
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:39,799
step we had a question online from sud

552
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,919
um he says we know about conserved

553
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:43,760
genomic locations is this knowledge

554
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,760
accounted for in the

555
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,840
model um I'm assuming you mean like

556
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,919
demographic they mean demographic models

557
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,559
um

558
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:56,240
and yes to the extent that when people

559
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,640
try to fit these demographic models they

560
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,000
try to find the most NE regions of the

561
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,120
genome that they can so they're not

562
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,640
going to use like missense mutations um

563
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,279
they'll use ingenic or synonymous sites

564
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:14,520
to try to you know be as unaffected by

565
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:16,200
by selection as possible yeah

566
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,360
yeah

567
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,200
yeah great great so what we talk about

568
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,400
when we talk about Fitness or natural

569
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,720
selection is alal frequency changes that

570
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:30,400
are due to um differences in Fitness

571
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,320
genotypes and we can Define Fitness

572
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,559
pretty broadly as the reproductive

573
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,679
contribution of an individual to to the

574
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,559
Next Generation Um and then we would

575
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,279
assign Fitness values to each of the

576
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:43,840
possible um genotypes at our site and we

577
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:45,919
can kind of think of these as average

578
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,840
values for each

579
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,200
genotype then the alal frequency change

580
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,279
due to selection in each generation the

581
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,159
expected alal frequency change um is

582
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:59,000
going to be proportional to P1 minus P

583
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:02,960
so this sort of genetic VAR Varan at

584
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,720
that Locus and the regression of this

585
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,880
Fitness value on on the genotype right

586
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,320
so we can code these genotypes as like

587
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,919
zero one2 or one by the frequency of the

588
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,080
AL within that genotype and then the

589
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,960
regression of Fitness on that is going

590
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,960
to tell us what should happen in that

591
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,320
generation on average to the to the Alo

592
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,960
frequency and so things can be additive

593
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,919
if there's simply a linear relationship

594
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,360
between genotype and fitness or you can

595
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,880
have more complicated dominance

596
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,960
relationships um you know where those

597
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,600
Fitness values don't necessar are have a

598
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,799
more complicated relationship let's say

599
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:40,360
with with Fitness

600
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:43,159
right uh yeah so right a lot of the

601
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:46,440
genome is constrained as the question

602
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:48,240
asker had asked um so there are various

603
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,600
estimates of this but let's say that

604
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,760
like maybe approximately s seven to 10%

605
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,399
of the human genome is constrained by

606
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:58,720
what we would call uh negative selection

607
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:01,720
this can vary a lot from coding regions

608
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,480
where it's really really high um to

609
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,760
transposable elements where it's almost

610
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,840
entirely absent um but a large

611
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,120
proportion actually of the of the human

612
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,279
genome is subject to some amount of

613
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,880
negative

614
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,240
selection and we're going to very simply

615
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,039
model this um by saying like Okay we

616
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,960
have some ancestral genotype let's call

617
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:23,399
it this a um and then the heterozy and

618
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:28,120
homozyg genotypes are going to have some

619
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:30,520
reduction in Fitness um due to selection

620
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,640
um and you know for Simplicity just you

621
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,600
know let these be S and 2s to do this

622
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,640
additive relationship and if that's true

623
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:41,279
the expected alal frequency change um

624
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:44,600
should be proportional to that selection

625
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:47,919
coefficient s here um times this P1

626
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:50,880
minus P right so now we can again apply

627
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,960
this diffusion model and a pone random

628
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,000
field infinite sites approximation

629
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,159
simply as we did before and just like we

630
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,840
got this Theta this NE times mu

631
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:01,720
parameter out the first time you add the

632
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,840
second parameter which I like to call

633
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,159
Big s which is the product of the

634
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,960
effective population size um and that

635
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,360
selection

636
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,440
coefficient right and so this gives us

637
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,200
then something we could call uh if

638
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,360
purifying selection is not too strong

639
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:23,120
some U mutation selection drift balance

640
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,880
whereas this compound s parameter

641
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,640
increases um you go from the neutral

642
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,279
sight frequency spectrum right which is

643
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:33,520
this uh this linear um relationship with

644
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,360
d dve Deo frequency and the the

645
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,240
frequency spectrum and you start

646
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,640
dropping off as you reach higher

647
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,200
frequencies and so we can conclude that

648
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,039
as selection coefficients go up that

649
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:48,520
natural selection prevents you from

650
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:50,279
reaching um higher and higher or as as

651
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,360
selection coefficient goes up natural

652
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:54,240
selection prevents you from reing

653
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,640
reaching increasingly low alal

654
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,960
frequencies and one way in which this is

655
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,320
conceptualized um is as a drift barrier

656
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,799
that approximately this 1 over s

657
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,919
frequency um selection will prevent you

658
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,960
from prevent that delus alal from

659
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:11,159
getting any higher and so that's drawn

660
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,960
as these Dash lines here and this

661
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,880
actually provides in many cases you know

662
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,080
a pretty good approximation to the to

663
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,360
the uh to the action of selection in the

664
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,440
case of weak weak weak purifying

665
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,440
selection um right

666
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,240
so one observation that's come out of of

667
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,480
a lot of work in human genetics and and

668
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,200
other organisms well is that a actually

669
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,720
a large amount of human mutations

670
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,279
generate this weekly deleterious

671
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,679
variation right we have all this

672
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:38,080
constrainted sequence in the genome but

673
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,480
we know that it's not anywhere close to

674
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,200
lethal because that would you know be

675
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,880
actually quite bad it's you're not

676
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,799
getting there um right so we can use the

677
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,240
SFS actually to estimate the

678
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,760
distribution of this weekly deleterious

679
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,760
mutation we have this uh sample

680
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,519
frequency spectrum SFS over here uh we

681
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,000
previously you know integrated over some

682
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,600
binomial sampling

683
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,200
right but we can additionally add to

684
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,360
this this distribution of Fitness

685
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,039
effects or or DFE that's hopefully going

686
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:10,000
to tell us how much of the genome is

687
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,440
creating selection at uh at different

688
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,559
intensities um and this is done by

689
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,679
comparing these um minor alal frequency

690
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:20,000
counts for different you know regions of

691
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,279
the genome so intergenic sites have more

692
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,919
genetic variation compared to even

693
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:26,799
synonymous and certainly non-synonymous

694
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,799
uh sites and you can use that to

695
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,279
estimate this distribution of Fitness

696
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,440
effects when this is done you do indeed

697
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,960
find this huge mass of mutation that

698
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,799
should be generating these weakly

699
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,919
deleterious uh

700
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:42,919
mutations uh these weakly delarius

701
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,600
mutations are of pretty high importance

702
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:46,000
because they contribute

703
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,640
disproportionately to trait and disease

704
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,440
heritability as well as the gowos hits

705
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,080
that we we actually find um so if we say

706
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,120
that like the additive uh the

707
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,960
contribution to additive genic variance

708
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,159
for an alate frequency p is this 2 Beta

709
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,240
P1 minus p

710
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,640
um and if we let this selection

711
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,720
coefficient let's say be proportional to

712
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,000
let's say the squared effect size they

713
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,880
then you can calculate what the expected

714
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,799
contribution to genetic variance should

715
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:17,039
be from um from mutations with selection

716
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:19,919
coefficient s um so if we plot the per

717
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,159
site contribution to to that genetic

718
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,559
variance against the selection

719
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:26,080
coefficient we say that it increases

720
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:27,840
with the strength of of selection and

721
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,880
that's even higher if you assume a model

722
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,399
of stabilizing selection which I versus

723
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,960
purifying selection which I won't

724
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:35,760
actually really explain but you know let

725
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,080
it suffice to say that like a large

726
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,919
amount of of heritability should be

727
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,000
contributed by deleterious alals and it

728
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,200
might even be more in this nearly

729
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,519
neutral range than expected from a

730
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,960
simple model and indeed when this is you

731
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:51,559
know this is from yal Simons and

732
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,000
Jonathan pritchard's group um you know

733
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:55,440
trying to estimate that DFE for gwos

734
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,279
hits for a large number of different

735
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,039
traits and again indeed you still you do

736
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,760
find this you know large mass of of uh

737
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,600
heritability that should be coming from

738
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,679
this intermediate range of weekly

739
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,279
selected

740
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,240
variants this also makes sense in terms

741
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:11,679
of a philogenetic constraint where if we

742
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,399
look at

743
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,159
phenetically um trying to find

744
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,039
phenetically constrained positions in

745
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,840
the genome that is places that don't

746
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:22,799
vary very much between um related

747
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,840
species such as mammals or

748
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:29,640
primates and annotating um variance by

749
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:32,679
this constraint in in philogynes shows

750
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,159
that this is you know perhaps by far the

751
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,919
the largest contributor to heritability

752
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,200
enrichment of any kind of annotation you

753
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:43,240
might provide

754
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,679
right and so how does that how does that

755
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,039
then coincide with our view of of weak

756
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,679
selection contributing a lot of

757
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:53,760
heritability well if we ask how often

758
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:55,720
should mutations fix relative to neutral

759
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,639
for for different strengths of

760
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,720
selection we can see that you don't

761
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:01,679
actually need that strong of a selection

762
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,799
coefficient in order to really prevent

763
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,679
almost any uh any fixations to occur on

764
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,440
on this philogyny so if we're talking

765
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,840
about getting to constraint up in this

766
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,840
area on on the right over here you very

767
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:18,039
quickly get there um uh you very quickly

768
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,039
get to this nearly neutral

769
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,919
range uh okay so that was week selection

770
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,080
um on the other hand selection might

771
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:28,639
actually be very strong and you can sort

772
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,240
of to almost remove the drift part of it

773
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:33,039
uh to get to what we might call just

774
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,679
mutation selection balance uh where at

775
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:37,240
equilibrium the expected frequency of

776
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,720
strongly selected mutation should be the

777
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,880
mutation rate um over the selection

778
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,720
coefficient and right this sort of makes

779
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,679
intuitive sense that as mutations

780
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:49,039
actually become lethal so it's

781
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,559
heterozygous selection coefficient goes

782
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,240
to one their frequency do just match the

783
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,080
denova mutation

784
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,360
rate right and you know in reality

785
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,600
there's a variance in this that's

786
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,720
determined by this uh by this Theta

787
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,720
parameter but for many applications

788
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,799
thinking about things in terms of this

789
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,840
deterministic um mutation selection

790
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,919
balance is actually really

791
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,200
helpful um right so now we want to

792
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:14,440
measure strong constraint in the genome

793
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,200
what are we going to do well you know a

794
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,760
large fraction of the genome has

795
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,240
mutation rates that are in the order of

796
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,799
let's say 2 * 109 per generation and so

797
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,080
if that's close to lethal that's like

798
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:27,519
your frequency in in the population and

799
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,639
that would require an enormous sample

800
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,279
size with any confidence that this

801
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:33,960
mutation was actually um having these

802
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:35,840
strong Fitness effects and so we still

803
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,039
need to group sites in order to estimate

804
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,240
the proportion that are under this

805
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,559
extreme purifying

806
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,720
selection uh where this is most commonly

807
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:45,519
applied perhaps is in the case of

808
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,760
selection on loss of function mutations

809
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,120
in protein coating genes where you know

810
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,039
in addition to protein truncating

811
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,639
variance you have a bunch of stuff that

812
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,360
affects splicing and then you can then

813
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:57,360
apply a model where let's say we've

814
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,519
estimated the mutation rate at each site

815
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,559
in the gene

816
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,320
and you can get this new parameter in

817
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:06,039
order to estimate that selection

818
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,559
coefficient um yeah this is you know

819
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:10,639
what's done sort of

820
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:13,480
fistic um in in this LT score maybe just

821
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:15,320
by comparing it observed versus expected

822
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,320
uh counts of loss of function mutations

823
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,880
taking that lower bound there uh and

824
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,240
indeed like when you calculate these

825
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,559
constraint measures they're you know

826
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,760
highly enriched in hlo and sufficient

827
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,279
genes and not in neutral

828
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,480
stuff um alternatively there's methods

829
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,600
that actually explicitly estimate this

830
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,880
heterozygous selection coefficient um

831
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,039
and interesting you might ask okay well

832
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,880
am I really getting at this uh you know

833
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,760
am I you know really getting the

834
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,720
calibrated s or am I just getting

835
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,519
something proportional to it and does

836
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,200
actually turn out seem to be the case

837
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:50,399
that you're getting something that's on

838
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,919
the correct scale um because we one

839
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,360
prediction is actually that these s hat

840
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,039
estimates if they're real should be um

841
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,320
you know approximately equal to the

842
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:00,240
fraction of of mutation

843
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,120
in any generation that are caused by

844
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,720
denovo the fraction of variant that are

845
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,519
caused by denovo mutations in any

846
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,200
generation and this does seem to line up

847
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,079
pretty well indicating that these sad

848
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,079
estimates are actually somewhat

849
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,040
estimating that that real population

850
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:14,839
genetic

851
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,440
parer um yeah and there's some available

852
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:19,639
estimates of this I won't go through

853
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,560
that right now though okay so now I

854
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,440
guess in the remaining time we'll get

855
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:27,000
through as much of of the coalescent uh

856
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,560
as we can uh and this is really going to

857
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,440
change gears a little bit um but it it's

858
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:36,159
another way of looking at genetic

859
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:39,079
variation that's extremely valuable um

860
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,960
right so we have you know a right simple

861
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:44,359
right Fisher like population here on the

862
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,839
right and in each generation individuals

863
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:49,440
are going to you know contribute some

864
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:51,000
number of uh Offspring to that

865
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,639
population you can go through that

866
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,839
generation after generation and this is

867
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,359
what we thought about as creating this

868
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:59,920
uh genetic drift right alter we can we

869
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:02,640
can view this as let's say we sampled

870
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,480
some individuals into the present and we

871
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,720
followed them backwards in time instead

872
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,800
um and so each generation were then

873
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,560
going to follow that variant to the

874
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:18,000
parents um and doing that step by step

875
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,599
and eventually what's going to happen is

876
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,760
that pairs that we sampled in the

877
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,480
present are going to find their genetic

878
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,359
variance in the same parent um at some

879
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,640
point in the past and meaning that they

880
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,079
you know inherited from that parent the

881
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,480
same the same genetic material and this

882
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:37,920
is what we call coalescent events and if

883
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,520
we're looking at things backwards in

884
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,480
time we this is where you know those

885
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,800
independent lineages actually merge and

886
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,280
eventually you're going to get back to

887
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,040
just one single uh lineage of sort of

888
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,400
some like Grand ancestor um of the

889
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,160
population at the very least of that

890
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,920
Locus and so there's two things about

891
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,280
this we want to model backwards in time

892
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,520
we also want to think about um genetic

893
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,760
variation in terms of of genealogies um

894
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,240
which is actually something that's true

895
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,280
regardless of what model of evolution uh

896
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,880
one

897
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,400
assumes um the most common statistical

898
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,760
model for this is called the the Kingman

899
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,560
calleson and it's a simple you know

900
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,880
model for building the genealogy you

901
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:19,000
know totally agnostic to any mutations

902
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,720
we think about the genealogy first and

903
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,720
so going back to this example we had

904
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,040
these three samples here and we had

905
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,079
their coalescent events here for

906
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,480
individuals one and two and here for

907
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,280
individuals 1 2 and

908
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,839
three and all that really matters is

909
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,880
this very simple tree here on on the

910
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,000
left there's a ton of evolution that

911
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,520
happened in the rest of the population

912
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,040
but if we've just sampled these three

913
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,720
individuals that doesn't have any effect

914
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,760
on the patterns of genetic variation in

915
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,400
our sample so we can really just focus

916
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,880
on what happens to the lineages

917
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,680
corresponding to these three

918
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,400
individuals

919
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,599
um so the the the generating process for

920
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,319
the under What's called the Kingman

921
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:02,520
coalescent is to say okay we've sampled

922
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:04,960
some let's say four lineages from the

923
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,720
population each pair is going to Co

924
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,760
coales at a rate inversely proportional

925
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,560
to the effective population size and you

926
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,839
know that's going to be so then we would

927
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,960
sample a time to to a coalescent event

928
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,920
these are going to be like competing uh

929
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,760
exponential distributions and then when

930
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,480
that coalescent event occurs we just

931
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,200
choose a pair of lineages to call less

932
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:30,119
and you can just apply these rules again

933
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:32,920
and again to generate uh random random

934
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:34,960
genealogies then the nice part of all

935
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,359
this is that the genealogical process is

936
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,079
totally independent of the mutational

937
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,880
process so you can sample your

938
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:43,119
genealogies and let's say we sampled

939
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,760
this tree over here for these four

940
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,040
samples and then you can add mutations

941
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,520
on top of that after the fact um and you

942
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,560
can really choose whatever mutational

943
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,160
model you want uh we might use the

944
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,760
infinite sites model as we had

945
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,440
previously and say that mutations occur

946
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,319
as a pon process along each brand with

947
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,200
some rate new and under this model each

948
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:07,400
mutational event would correspond to a

949
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,760
unique smv which is again the exact same

950
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,319
model that we considered previously um

951
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,000
with this Plus on random field and the

952
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:15,200
site frequency spectrum you know but you

953
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,520
could also put in some whatever

954
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,839
nucleotide substitution model model you

955
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,800
want and the important part is that

956
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:22,440
these neutral mutations are independent

957
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,200
of the

958
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,680
genealogy uh we can add recombination to

959
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,560
this Rec combination is a very complex

960
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,359
process and we're going to model it as

961
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:35,520
some probability of recombination that

962
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:38,160
occurs each generation with some uh rate

963
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,319
R and so the total Rec combination

964
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,680
probability for some sequence L would

965
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:44,480
just be L time

966
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,000
R now in addition to these coalescent

967
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,240
rates if we're viewing things backward

968
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,040
in time we can also add in recombination

969
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:54,400
events that are going to split pieces of

970
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,800
your sampled genetic material up into

971
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:01,400
independent lineages so you then have

972
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:04,760
this process where um lineages are both

973
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:08,480
splitting up due to recombination and

974
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,119
coalescing due to Shared ancestor events

975
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,440
and so this is a very simple you know

976
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:16,319
example here first you get this um first

977
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,440
you get this uh recombination event that

978
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:22,319
splits this up then this piece of the

979
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,960
genetic material uh coalesces with this

980
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:26,319
other sample such that you found a

981
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,800
common ancestor event for that first

982
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:30,240
piece of the the sequence there and then

983
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,920
eventually it's going to coales with the

984
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,079
rest of the sequence and what this would

985
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,280
lead to is a shorter Gene tree at this

986
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:38,680
first part of the sequence and a longer

987
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,119
one at the second

988
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,520
part this leads to correlated

989
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,040
genealogies along the genome right so

990
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,720
you're doing these recombination events

991
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,480
it means that the genealogies at nearby

992
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,440
positions even with recombination are

993
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,160
going to be correlated and this is how

994
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,760
we get you know correlation of genetic

995
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:58,560
variation and linkage dise

996
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,240
equilibrium um

997
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,200
so one way to then summarize all of this

998
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,839
you know complicated process the set of

999
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,520
geneological treats at each Locus is

1000
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:08,760
through the ancestral recombination

1001
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,160
graph which really says right this is

1002
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,880
this sequence of geneological trees that

1003
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:15,200
each Locus in the genome these

1004
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,960
recombination events that connect them

1005
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,160
and the locations and identities of of

1006
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:24,200
mutations um and this is an object

1007
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,079
that's you know a really um uh focus of

1008
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,680
a lot of recent research and there's a

1009
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,560
large number of models that are trying

1010
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,359
to estimate this thing really for your

1011
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:34,839
sample at each point in the

1012
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:37,280
genome um there's two common features of

1013
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:40,200
ARG inference um you know this is a

1014
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,920
difficult process uh one trick is to

1015
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,920
sort of cluster cluster your samples at

1016
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:48,160
each point in the genome uh to then you

1017
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,599
know get a position specific distance

1018
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,960
Matrix between all your Hypes oops and

1019
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:54,000
then use some clustering out and produce

1020
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,280
trees and another trick is to sort of

1021
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,119
you know if you have a if you have this

1022
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,079
R you can thread

1023
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,599
new Hypes onto those existing trees and

1024
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,000
sort of combining both of those two

1025
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,359
things you can get actually pretty good

1026
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,680
estimates of of the AR genome

1027
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:12,040
wide um so quickly for for Selective

1028
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,200
sweeps just to touch on uh pause of

1029
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,599
selection okay so why is this in the the

1030
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:18,119
coalescent part well the one of the main

1031
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:20,560
features of sweeps is that they have

1032
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:22,200
this uh effect of selection on nearby

1033
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,319
genetic variation so if we had a

1034
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,119
positively selected Al it's going to

1035
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,000
have this sort of like logistic growth

1036
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:30,880
trajectory up from low frequencies to

1037
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,880
high ones and the rest of the neutral

1038
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,000
variation linked to that selected site

1039
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,040
um is going to have to sort of follow

1040
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,119
this size trajectory right and so that's

1041
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,880
going to cause longer branches um

1042
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:46,560
leading to more low frequency variance

1043
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,920
but also reduce genetic variation

1044
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,400
they're going to have to coess um

1045
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,200
lineage are going to have to coales

1046
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,319
before the origin of this mutation you

1047
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,480
compare this to just like a neutral

1048
00:41:55,319 --> 00:42:01,200
genealogy and make some INF is about

1049
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,359
where uh where selective sweeps occurred

1050
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,480
in in in the

1051
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:06,400
genome right so again okay so you can

1052
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,839
have some example this is just from a

1053
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,079
silly simulation of what genetic what

1054
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:13,359
the what genealogies look like linked to

1055
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:15,079
a sweep versus neutral ones and see

1056
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,960
there's a lot of this really rare

1057
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:19,920
variation down here and you don't have

1058
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,200
as much of these um long internal

1059
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,200
branches with uh with lots of

1060
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,599
descendants right and so methods try to

1061
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,200
estimate um sweep in the human genome

1062
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:32,079
and elsewhere and it turns out obvious

1063
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,839
sweeps are are quite rare in human so

1064
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:38,079
there are certainly a large number of

1065
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:40,160
high compix samples this is from this uh

1066
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:44,640
Swiffer method from The ROC condrin

1067
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:47,599
group um but in general like sweeps

1068
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,280
don't seem to be particularly common um

1069
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,480
and if you look around synonymous versus

1070
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,079
nonsynonymous substitutions the patterns

1071
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,319
of genetic variation are are actually um

1072
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:00,319
actually quite similar indicating that

1073
00:42:57,319 --> 00:43:02,720
hasn't been you know these massive Flux

1074
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:06,079
Of sweeps across human

1075
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,680
history okay so I guess right before we

1076
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,760
end I'm going to talk a little bit about

1077
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,400
simulation so we've gone through a lot

1078
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,760
of models and one thing I want to

1079
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,559
impress on you is just try to make

1080
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,079
calculations under these yourself and

1081
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:23,200
when you do so start as simple as

1082
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,480
humanly uh as humanly possible and so if

1083
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,559
what you want to calculate is just a

1084
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,960
summary some simple summary of AAL

1085
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:31,839
frequency using simulations like these

1086
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,280
daddy diffusion models is is really

1087
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,760
great you can incorporate negative

1088
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,760
selection it's incredibly fast you can

1089
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,839
incorporate complex demographic models

1090
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,040
and get this Alo frequency spectrum that

1091
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:45,440
you can then make your Downstream

1092
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:47,319
calculations from if what you want is

1093
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,400
neutral mutations and you really care

1094
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:52,400
about modeling liage dise equilibrium

1095
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,720
coalescent simulations are the way to go

1096
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,520
you can fast you can quickly simulate

1097
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,160
very large chromosomes for instance with

1098
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:01,280
this MS Prime method you can specify Rec

1099
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,280
combination rate and mutation rate

1100
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,960
complex metapopulations and even these

1101
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,240
effects of selective sweeps on neutral

1102
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,839
variation and if you really really need

1103
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,000
to go more complex than that you have

1104
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:14,760
interaction between multiple selected

1105
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,440
sites and their effect on neutral um

1106
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,800
genic variation as well as their own

1107
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,359
frequencies then you might have to do

1108
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,880
right Fisher simulations such as in this

1109
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:24,359
slim uh slim framework this is

1110
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,280
necessarily slow because it it's

1111
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:30,119
simulating all of these processes

1112
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,880
Generation by Generation Um and you can

1113
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,160
ass stuff like polygenic selection

1114
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,839
multiple variants but it's very easy to

1115
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,559
make mistakes and not realize that you

1116
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:41,319
did so and the manual is 850 pages long

1117
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:44,359
um so you know I I would encourage you

1118
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:46,319
to start start simple it if you

1119
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:48,760
can

1120
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,559
um yeah I guess we're about out of time

1121
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,240
um I have some slides on you know some

1122
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:57,359
resources and genetic data but you know

1123
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:57,359
those will be posted online I suppose
