1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,960
hello can people hear me in the

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,600
back yeah thumbs up

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,800
okay uh so today we're going to be

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,960
continuing our discussion of uh

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,439
probability uh in the last lecture we

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,640
saw uh how to compute probabilities

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,880
using the uh oh dear uh using the uh

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,880
tree method and this lecture we are

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,879
going to uh you know see how some of the

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,680
tools that we learned in the last unit

11
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:38,120
for

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,680
counting uh for for reasoning about the

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,480
sizes of sets and things like that can

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,960
also carry over naturally into the uh

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,920
into the realm of probability okay uh

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,680
and we'll also learn how to express

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,440
mathematically uh statements like uh if

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,120
you recall I was saying things last time

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,760
like you know if the prize is behind

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,160
door a what is the probability that uh

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,359
Marilyn selects door b or or something

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,159
like that okay so we're going to uh you

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,640
know see you know more formally what

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,880
these statements are are trying to

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,080
express and how to reason about them

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,159
okay so uh recall how we Define the

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,439
probability of an event a so an event is

28
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,560
just a set of

29
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,360
outcomes uh our probability function PR

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,600
is a function from uh the set of

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,439
outcomes the sample space uh to the

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,240
interval 0 to 1 and we can can extend

33
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,200
this naturally to events by saying that

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,880
the probability of an event is just the

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,320
sum of the probabilities of all of the

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,159
outcomes in that event

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,799
okay so an immediate consequence of this

38
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,000
definition or several immediate

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,079
consequences I suppose are the following

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,079
so first we have the sum

41
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:59,280
rule so if we have two events uh A and B

42
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:01,840
and they're disjoint so A and B are

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,840
disjoint of

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,239
events this tells us that the

45
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,360
probability of the Union of A and

46
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,560
B is what what do we think that

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,560
is any

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,160
ideas

49
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,760
yeah yeah the sum of the probabilities

50
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:30,640
so probability of

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,640
a plus the probability of B

52
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,200
okay so very similar to what we saw with

53
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,319
sets if you have two disint sets the

54
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,760
size of their Union is the same as as

55
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,120
the uh sum of the individual sizes the

56
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,440
same thing happens with

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,879
probability okay uh we also have the

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,879
complement

59
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,120
rule so if we have some event a what do

60
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,680
we think the

61
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,159
probability of the complement of a is so

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,159
the probability that a does doesn't

63
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,360
occur oh I should

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,360
probably

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:18,120
yeah what's the probability of not

66
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,120
a anybody

67
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,760
yeah yeah one minus the probability of

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,480
a

69
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,200
okay right because uh a and not a are

70
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,879
disjoint and one of them must happen so

71
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,360
you know with certainty uh one of a or

72
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,760
not a happens so the probability of

73
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,239
their Union is one so this kind of just

74
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,239
follows from the sum rule

75
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,560
okay what else do we

76
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,400
have uh the difference

77
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:01,400
rule okay so in this case suppose we

78
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:04,040
have uh again two events a and B and

79
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:08,000
this time we'd like to look at the

80
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,000
difference a set minus

81
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,280
B what do we think that might be in

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,280
terms of the probabilities of A and

83
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,639
B yeah

84
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,520
exactly so the probability of

85
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,320
a minus the

86
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,320
probability of the

87
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,479
intersection

88
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,080
okay and why is that well a is just the

89
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,120
disjoint Union of a minus b and a

90
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,639
intercept B

91
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,919
okay uh we also have an analog of

92
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,919
principle of uh inclusion exclusion

93
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:10,000
so the probability of

94
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,240
uh a union B for more General A and B so

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,039
you know they're not necessarily

96
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,360
disjoint

97
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,080
anymore just like we had with sets this

98
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,160
is going to be the probability of

99
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,400
a plus the probability of

100
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,680
B minus the

101
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,680
probability of the

102
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,160
intersection okay

103
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:40,720
and we have a couple of um new uh rules

104
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,520
that don't really have analoges in in

105
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,400
the case of uh uh like in the case of

106
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,479
counting

107
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,479
sets so first we have the union

108
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:50,479
Bond

109
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,440
oops

110
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:04,280
so probability of a union B it's less

111
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,400
than or equal to probability of

112
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,520
a plus probability of b or I suppose I

113
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,000
shouldn't say it doesn't really have an

114
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,000
analog but we didn't really look at the

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
analog

116
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:22,319
okay and why might that be the

117
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,319
case yeah oh

118
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,360
yeah uh so uh the question is what's the

119
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:31,919
difference between the sum Rule and Pi

120
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,840
so so in the sum rule we assume that A

121
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,400
and B are

122
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,560
disjoint okay so if a and b are disjoint

123
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,479
then their intersection is is empty so

124
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,759
the intersection has zero probability so

125
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,759
Pi is just a way to generalize uh the

126
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,319
the sum rule okay to to the case where

127
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,520
they're they're not necessarily disjoint

128
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,919
anymore they may have a non-trivial

129
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,160
intersection okay good question any

130
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,160
other

131
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:05,199
questions no okay so can anybody give a

132
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,199
reason why the union bound might be

133
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,080
true

134
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,720
yeah yeah so the answer was the

135
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,039
probability of the intersection is not

136
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:24,440
negative right so uh you know if we just

137
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,280
take PI right so this holds you know

138
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,240
with

139
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,759
equality and now if we just you know get

140
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,080
rid of this negative term here we can

141
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,319
only increase the uh the probability

142
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,960
because all probabilities have to be

143
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:40,680
between zero and one

144
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,680
okay uh we also have

145
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,479
monotonicity again I don't think we uh

146
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,319
you know saw an analogue of this with

147
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:54,440
sets but uh you know

148
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:58,680
if a is a subset of B what do you think

149
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,680
that tells us about the uh probabilities

150
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,960
and

151
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,520
ites I'm I'm seeing some uh hand

152
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,520
motions

153
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,720
so as you might expect from the

154
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,240
name if a is a subset of B then its

155
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,400
probability should be smaller than the

156
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,400
the probability of

157
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
B

158
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,440
okay so do these make uh do these make

159
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,440
sense to everybody

160
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,240
okay so just as we saw with uh with

161
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,360
sets uh both the sum rule the union

162
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,360
bound and uh principle of inclusion

163
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,760
exclusion can all generalize to you know

164
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:55,680
arbitrary numbers of of uh events uh or

165
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,800
even you know countably many okay uh I

166
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,680
suppose principle of inclusion exclusion

167
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,320
you should probably only think about you

168
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,800
know finite cases but the other two are

169
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,519
you know they fairly naturally

170
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:10,320
generalize to uh to countable sets of

171
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,000
events okay so do these rules make sense

172
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,480
to everybody he'll probably be using

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,279
them quite a lot so uh you know make

174
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,279
sure you're familiar with

175
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,000
them any

176
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,720
questions

177
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,959
okay so in that case let us move on to

178
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,320
the main topic of today's lecture

179
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,320
conditional

180
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,440
probability okay so if you recall on

181
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,880
Tuesday when we were talking about the

182
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,480
Monty Hall problem when we were drawing

183
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,880
a tree diagram right um we were making

184
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,240
statements such as you know if the car

185
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,680
is behind door one what's the

186
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,000
probability that we picked door two or I

187
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,959
guess it was you purple gold and green

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,279
uh purple gold silver silver

189
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:10,200
yeah uh so how do we express this

190
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,040
mathematically uh so that's where

191
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,839
conditional probability comes

192
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,680
in we're going to make use of the

193
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,920
following definition okay so if we have

194
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,920
two

195
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,519
events A and

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,519
B uh we Define the conditional

197
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,519
probability

198
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,200
of a given

199
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:47,399
B

200
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,399
okay uh which we denote as the

201
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,880
following so we' say uh you know a

202
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,000
conditioned on B right we denote that

203
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,639
with a vertical

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,399
bar we Define this to be

205
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,880
the

206
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:08,760
probability of a intersect

207
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,760
B divided by the probability of

208
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,839
B

209
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,639
okay so intuitively you can kind of

210
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,720
think of it a little bit as uh you know

211
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,519
we're trying to scale our probability

212
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,959
space so that you know B becomes our

213
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,959
entire entire sample space okay so we

214
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,120
kind of want to divide out this this

215
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,079
probability of B uh so that you know we

216
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,240
still get a a probability space all of

217
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:37,360
the probabilities sum to one okay does

218
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,480
that kind of make sense to

219
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,360
everybody and then you know the analog

220
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,839
of a right we're you know only looking

221
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,360
at everything that that's already within

222
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,160
B so we're looking at the intersection

223
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,160
of A and

224
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,160
B

225
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,680
okay now if we rewrite this we can get a

226
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,680
product rule

227
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:08,639
right so if we want to know the

228
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,160
probability of a intercept B we can kind

229
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,200
of just move this probability of B over

230
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,199
to the other

231
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,079
side and we end up with probability of a

232
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:17,600
intersect

233
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,720
b

234
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,519
equals probability of a given

235
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:28,720
B times the

236
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,720
probability of B

237
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,600
okay and as you might expect you can

238
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,880
extend this to multiple

239
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,360
events or I guess this is already kind

240
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,800
of multiple events you can extend it to

241
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,320
more than two

242
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:49,880
events so you can also have

243
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,560
EG the probability of a intercept B

244
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,120
intercept

245
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,440
C

246
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,880
equals

247
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,040
probability of a given being

248
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:06,399
T times the

249
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,880
probability of B uh or maybe I should

250
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,880
write this out more

251
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,959
explicitly B intercept C okay and then

252
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,279
if we apply our uh apply our binary

253
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:19,760
product rule again we can kind of expand

254
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:25,519
out that uh this

255
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:29,240
term as the probability of a given B and

256
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,320
C probability of

257
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,199
B given

258
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,399
C

259
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:36,399
probability of

260
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,320
C

261
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:42,440
okay so that's basically what we were

262
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:47,399
doing on Tuesday you know written out

263
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:50,839
more formally right so

264
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:53,360
uh like probability of C corresponds to

265
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,800
you know what is the first Edge we chose

266
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,079
you know the the first Edge going away

267
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,320
from the root okay and then conditioned

268
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,040
on reaching a particular vertex like

269
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,079
conditioned on you know Monty hiding the

270
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,800
prize in the gold

271
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:10,360
box you know what's the probability that

272
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,000
Marilyn chooses the silver one okay so

273
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,000
that's the conditional probability of

274
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
choosing the Silver Box conditioned on

275
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,720
the the prize being in the gold box okay

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,920
and then you know as you continue along

277
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,160
the uh uh along the path to a

278
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,199
leaf uh all of the edge probabilities

279
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,079
that you're looking at are secret like

280
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,639
they were secretly just you know basic

281
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:34,160
additional probabilities okay does that

282
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,160
make sense to

283
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,639
everybody any

284
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,160
questions

285
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:50,680
okay so another extension of this that

286
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,680
you may find

287
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,639
useful is the

288
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:01,959
following a intersect B

289
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,600
given

290
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,279
C is going to

291
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:11,279
be

292
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:13,240
probability of a given B intercept

293
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,120
C

294
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,120
probability of B given

295
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,720
C

296
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:28,000
okay so can anybody see why that might

297
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,000
be the case

298
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,959
well first maybe we should look at you

299
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,000
know what exactly is it saying okay so

300
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:39,519
if you kind

301
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,880
of squint a little bit and get rid of

302
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,880
the C's

303
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,279
right it kind of looks a little

304
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:52,199
bit like the product rule right a

305
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,800
intercept B is

306
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:59,440
probability a given

307
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,880
B times probability of B

308
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,120
okay it it looks kind of like that right

309
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,000
but we've added a bunch of C's

310
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:10,160
everywhere so basically what we're

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
saying here is this is the product rule

312
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,079
in the probability space where we're you

313
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,240
know assuming C like it's it's the

314
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:20,920
product rule conditioned on

315
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,920
C okay does that make sense to

316
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,680
everybody and we can you know obtain it

317
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,880
from the from the previous line just by

318
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,880
dividing out by the probability of C

319
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:46,160
okay do people have questions are we

320
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,160
happy to move on to some examples yeah

321
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,360
sorry uh okay so the question was are we

322
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:59,360
talking about sets or events uh yes uh

323
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:03,920
so remember that uh events are defined

324
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,280
to be sets of outcomes right so uh you

325
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,959
know we're talking about events but you

326
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,679
know events are sets and we can treat

327
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,640
them as such so that's why we're using

328
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,360
uh lots of notation here that you would

329
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,919
typically associate with sets like Union

330
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,919
intersection

331
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,799
Etc okay any other questions oh yeah

332
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,520
ah uh so these are not nodes in the tree

333
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:40,440
um some of uh sorry question was if we

334
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,080
have an event that's like a union B

335
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,000
Union C or something uh are these

336
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,679
General sets or are they nodes in in the

337
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,799
tree um that is a good observation some

338
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,600
of the nodes in the tree kind of

339
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:56,080
naturally correspond to events right

340
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:59,000
like uh you know if we draw out our tree

341
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,440
diagram this node here fairly naturally

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
corresponds to this set of events like

343
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,880
or sorry this set of outcomes those

344
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,960
those two uh leaves in its sub tree uh

345
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,799
but not every event necessarily

346
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,880
corresponds to an internal node of the

347
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,760
tree like that like for instance you

348
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,120
could

349
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,520
have these two uh outcomes

350
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,120
right uh if you you know consider the

351
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,520
set of those two outcomes that's still a

352
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,039
valid event but it doesn't really

353
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,320
naturally correspond to a a a tree Noe

354
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,760
in the same way

355
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,760
does that make

356
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,080
sense oh that that is quite

357
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,039
possible okay um so asking about the

358
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:57,440
conditional probabilities as they appear

359
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,720
in the

360
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,720
tree uh

361
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,720
yes oh I see okay uh so I guess the the

362
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:20,799
way that I like to think about uh a

363
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,960
given B um it is an event in a different

364
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,520
probability

365
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,440
space so you can kind of think of uh you

366
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,840
know if you limit uh the scope rather

367
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,039
rather than you know talking about your

368
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,919
entire sample space s if you limit the

369
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,679
the scope to just C so you like scale

370
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,240
all of the probabilities down by by the

371
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,799
probability of C you you end up with a

372
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,760
different probability space so now the

373
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,360
probability of or sorry the event you

374
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,520
know be given C is an event in that

375
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:52,200
probability space does that make

376
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:56,679
sense okay yeah

377
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,679
sorry thank you for the clarification

378
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,000
okay so why don't we move on to some

379
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,919
examples then if uh if this makes you

380
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,520
know reasonable amount of sense

381
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,720
hopefully it'll make more sense after

382
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,320
examples okay so uh you know suppose Ash

383
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,280
and Gary are having a bunch of Pokemon

384
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,880
battles against each other and you know

385
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,720
they're doing like a tournament the the

386
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,320
first to win two battles uh wins the uh

387
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,440
the or I guess the series the first to

388
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,320
win two battles wins the series okay and

389
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,440
uh you know the the probability is of

390
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,919
Victor are not you know entirely uniform

391
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,720
so for the first match you know maybe

392
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:36,120
it's a toss up okay Ash wins with

393
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,679
probability one2 Gary wins with

394
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:42,720
probability one half okay uh but after

395
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,440
the first battle there's kind of an

396
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,000
advantage to whoever won the last battle

397
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,360
like you know their their their morale

398
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,960
is high or something they they do better

399
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,440
so they now have probability of 2/3 uh

400
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,760
of winning the next battle

401
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,159
okay and there aren't there aren't any

402
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,400
draws uh they're bitter Rivals they will

403
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:04,280
fight to the death

404
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:08,640
um

405
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:12,320
okay so let's define a couple of events

406
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,320
we'll say that a is the

407
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:20,520
event Ash

408
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,520
wins oops the

409
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:30,400
series and

410
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,840
B is the event uh Ash wins

411
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,840
the first

412
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:43,360
battal

413
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,360
okay so now we can ask for the

414
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,880
probability of a given

415
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:55,840
B

416
00:21:51,720 --> 00:22:02,200
okay so does does the problem setup make

417
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,200
sense yeah okay so how could we compute

418
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,120
this any ideas where do we want to

419
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,159
start should we just throw some numbers

420
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,240
out there oh

421
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:27,159
yeah yeah let's draw a tree diagram nice

422
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,720
one okay

423
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:33,600
so drawing a tree diagram what's the

424
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,880
first you know random thing that happens

425
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,880
what's the what's the first source of

426
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,840
Randomness

427
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:50,400
yeah yeah so F could win or lose the

428
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:52,440
first battle so we can actually label

429
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,960
these as

430
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:59,080
B and not B

431
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,240
okay what's the next random thing that

432
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,240
could

433
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,080
happen

434
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,799
yeah yeah that's right so actually maybe

435
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,840
it's better to call these just W and L

436
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,840
so we can use the same thing

437
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:28,600
everywhere so win lose win lose

438
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,600
regardless of uh whether he wins or

439
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,600
loses the first battle you can still

440
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,880
either win or lose the second one Okay

441
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,880
now what's the third layer going to

442
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:57,039
be

443
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:59,039
exactly yeah exactly okay so if he's one

444
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,760
two or lost two those are just leaves

445
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,640
now we don't do anything more the series

446
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:06,520
is over okay but if he's won one and

447
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,840
lost one in either order we can now

448
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,320
split

449
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:14,120
again oops that's a little bit long but

450
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,679
oh well WL

451
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:20,039
WL

452
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:23,360
okay so now what are our outcomes again

453
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:25,919
let's look at the uh uh paths from from

454
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,880
root to leaves and just you know label

455
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:33,919
with a uh a string of edge labels so

456
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:37,039
this is going to be W comma w w l

457
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:46,840
w w l

458
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:46,840
l l w w l w l and l

459
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:52,960
l

460
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:56,360
okay now what are the probabilities on

461
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,360
each of the edges

462
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,320
so in the first layer what's the

463
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,000
probability that Ash wins the first

464
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:11,640
game first match

465
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,640
yeah2 so each of these say probability

466
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:19,919
one2 okay now the second layer we said

467
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,960
are now conditional probabilities so

468
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,360
conditioned on winning the first match

469
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
what's the probability of winning the

470
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,279
second

471
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,320
match what's the probability on this

472
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,320
edge here

473
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,720
do we

474
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,720
remember 2/3

475
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,679
yeah and so the other branch is going to

476
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,600
be the complement of that so

477
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,399
1/3 okay and then for the bottom Branch

478
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,240
it's going to be exactly the opposite

479
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:54,799
okay it's going to be one3 chance of

480
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,799
winning 2/3 chance of

481
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,200
losing okay

482
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,080
now conditioned on winning the first

483
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:08,279
match and losing the second match what's

484
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,279
the probability of winning the

485
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,200
third

486
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:23,320
yeah one3

487
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:26,159
yeah so 1/3 win 2/3 loss and uh this

488
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,200
will be uh exactly the opposite so 2/3

489
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,919
win 1/3 loss

490
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,480
okay so now we can assign probabilities

491
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,679
to all of the outcomes

492
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,679
okay what's the probability of winning

493
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,399
twice how do we compute these

494
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,880
probabilities anyone

495
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,000
yeah uh oh so that this was uh just you

496
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,919
know what we assumed in the problem

497
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,440
right

498
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:04,279
if uh if it's not the first game uh you

499
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,399
win with probability 2/3 if you won the

500
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:09,080
last game or with probability 1/3 if you

501
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:09,080
lost the last

502
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:16,000
game okay so the the first branch is

503
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:18,000
50/50 but the subsequent ones are going

504
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,240
to be 2/3 1/3 in One Direction or the

505
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,480
other depending on the outcome of the

506
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,720
previous game maybe I shouldn't use

507
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,840
outcome depending on the result of the

508
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,840
previous

509
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,840
game okay

510
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,480
okay so how do we compute probabilities

511
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,480
of outcomes does anybody

512
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,159
remember

513
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:50,320
yeah yeah so you multiply probabilities

514
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,960
along paths two outcomes okay so for

515
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,399
this top outcome right we've got uh 1/2

516
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,880
* 2/3 so this is probability

517
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:03,360
1/3 uh win loss win has probability 1/3

518
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,919
by/ 12 by 1/3 so that's

519
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:10,279
118th uh when loss loss is probability

520
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:13,799
1/2 * 1/3 * 2/3 so that's going to be 1

521
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:18,399
nth uh and then these all

522
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:20,679
reverse 11 18th and

523
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,960
13 have I done that

524
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:26,360
correctly yes that looks

525
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,240
fine if I make an error please shout at

526
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,559
me uh okay

527
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,519
so we've got all of the uh we've got our

528
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,679
tree diagram we've got our sample space

529
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:39,519
we've got our our probability

530
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,519
function uh what's the next thing we

531
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,440
need do we remember

532
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:11,360
so we've got step one the

533
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,360
tree step two the uh

534
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,640
probabilities three right was the events

535
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,640
of

536
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,640
Interest

537
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:26,440
okay so what are the events we care

538
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,440
about here

539
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,760
yeah

540
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,519
pardon okay winning the tournament and

541
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:49,080
winning the first game okay

542
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:52,240
so uh a was uh y a was winning the

543
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:55,519
tournament B was winning the first

544
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,720
game uh is that

545
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,039
all are there any other events that we

546
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,039
care about

547
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:11,640
yeah yes exactly so we also

548
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,080
want a intersect B okay we also care

549
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,679
about the event where you win the first

550
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,679
battle and the series why is

551
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:27,080
that would you like to explain

552
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,720
or yeah exactly so ultimately we want

553
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,760
this conditional probability right the

554
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,399
probability of a given B and if we go

555
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,720
back to our definition right the

556
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,200
probability of a given B is the

557
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,519
probability of a intersect B divided by

558
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:46,200
the probability of B okay so as it turns

559
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:48,120
out we kind of don't really need a right

560
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:52,080
the two probabilities we really need are

561
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:58,559
these two or the two events I suppose

562
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:59,919
okay so finally for answer

563
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,399
what is our

564
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:07,360
answer well probability of a given

565
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:12,320
b as we just said is the probability of

566
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,279
a intersect B divide by probability of

567
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,000
B

568
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:18,000
okay what are each of these

569
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:22,919
probabilities well which events or sorry

570
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,399
which outcomes are in the event a

571
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:26,399
intersect B

572
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,279
it's ww in a intercept

573
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:41,639
B

574
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:45,279
yeah win loss win also yes okay win loss

575
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:47,639
loss nope and all of these he lost the

576
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,519
first game so these are also not in it

577
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:53,799
so we care about these two uh these two

578
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:59,840
outcomes okay so this is going to be by

579
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:59,840
the sum rule 1/3 +/ 18

580
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,600
that doesn't look much like an

581
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:09,880
eight oh well

582
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,880
okay now what's the probability of

583
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,080
B yeah yeah it's just one half right

584
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,399
either by symmetry or you can actually

585
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:28,480
look at what those outcomes are right

586
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:28,480
it's these top uh these top three

587
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:42,039
okay and if we do this arithmetic we've

588
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:42,039
got 7/8 divided 12 which is 7

589
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:48,200
nths

590
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,840
okay so the probability that Ash wins

591
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,200
the entire series given that he won the

592
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,679
first battle is going to be

593
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,279
79ths okay so so far this is pretty

594
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,279
straightforward right fairly routine uh

595
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:01,279
mathemat well

596
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,159
arithmetic but what if

597
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:11,440
instead we ask for the probability of B

598
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,440
given a

599
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,399
what is that

600
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,039
probability well numerically right we

601
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,120
can compute it in exactly the same way

602
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:50,880
right it's going to be the probability

603
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,320
of the intersection divided by this time

604
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,600
the probability of a rather than the

605
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,919
probability of B but still by symmetry

606
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,360
that probability is going to be2

607
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,360
okay so this is also going to be 7

608
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:07,559
9ths but what exactly does it

609
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,399
mean

610
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,639
yeah yeah so the answer was you know

611
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,879
given that you already won the series

612
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,879
what's the probability that he won the

613
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:28,960
first

614
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:32,399
battle okay now this might sound a

615
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,040
little bit weird to some of you right

616
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,879
like you know if we know that he's won

617
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,079
the series right everything's already

618
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:41,560
happened he either won the battle or he

619
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,960
didn't right but uh you know when we're

620
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,960
modeling probability questions you know

621
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,200
we don't really care about any sort of

622
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:54,119
temporal relations or anything like that

623
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:57,320
or even causal ones right like uh you

624
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:00,160
know we're just uh like it it's all just

625
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:02,240
you know numerical right you can kind of

626
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,839
think of it a bit like an inference

627
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,880
right like you know you've got some

628
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,680
uncertainty right like you know maybe

629
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,599
you're told that he won the battle you

630
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,079
want to or sorry you're told that he won

631
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,960
the series you want to update your

632
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,520
belief that you know maybe he won the

633
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,079
the first battle maybe he didn't uh and

634
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,800
maybe you're not entirely confident in

635
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,599
it uh but you'd like to estimate you

636
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,320
know how confident you should be uh that

637
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,240
might be one way to think about

638
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,880
it um

639
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,720
so in a sense it's kind of like looking

640
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,400
at a backwards probability that you know

641
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,359
something in the past has happened given

642
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:40,280
that we observed something in the

643
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:42,520
future uh so you know in general you

644
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,680
know they they won't always be the same

645
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,000
like this like you can kind of relate

646
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,960
the probability of B given a to the

647
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,079
probability of a given B they won't

648
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,400
always be equal okay let's see how to

649
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,400
relate

650
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:00,520
them it just so happens that in this

651
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,440
case right these two

652
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,240
things

653
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:08,000
oh these two things have the same

654
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,640
probability okay so that's really the

655
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,800
core reason why they were

656
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,800
equal but more generally we have the

657
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,599
following okay this is called base

658
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,960
rule

659
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,560
okay uh you can kind of think of it is

660
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,200
you know it's just the product rule in

661
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,960
disguise right so the

662
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:41,240
probability of B given

663
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:44,119
a equals the probability Oops why don't

664
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:48,000
I split this into two

665
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:49,730
lines probability of a given

666
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,280
B probability of

667
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:55,720
[Music]

668
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:58,839
B divided by probability of

669
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,680
a okay so in the example we just saw

670
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:03,839
these two are the same so they just

671
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,400
cancel uh but more generally you want to

672
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,800
multiply by the quotient okay and you

673
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,560
can kind of think of this as the product

674
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,480
rule in disguise right like if you just

675
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,319
move this probability of a over to this

676
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,880
side right uh now you're just Computing

677
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:22,640
the probability of the intersection of A

678
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:26,200
and B on both sides does that make

679
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,599
sense but uh it can often be useful uh

680
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,240
you know even though it's not really

681
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,240
saying anything new it can often be

682
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,240
useful to think about it in this way

683
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,359
okay if you kind of want to reverse the

684
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,000
direction of an

685
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:38,480
inference uh you want to multiply by the

686
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,599
quotient of the two event the two

687
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,359
probabilities of the events that you

688
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,920
care about

689
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:49,079
okay

690
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:52,839
uh and one particularly useful

691
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:57,119
uh consequence of this is the following

692
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:58,839
so suppose we have two events B and C

693
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,920
and we're kind of trying to condition

694
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:03,200
them both on the same

695
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:06,200
event

696
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,200
okay

697
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:15,119
so what is the probability of C given

698
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:17,760
a no B given a divided by the

699
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,760
probability of C given

700
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,760
a

701
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,319
okay and in particular often we would

702
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,079
take C to be the complement of b or

703
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:29,720
something like that and that will then

704
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:32,000
help us to compute this probability of

705
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,319
being given a

706
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,319
okay so as it turns out this is going to

707
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:42,119
be the probability of a given

708
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:44,599
B times the probability of

709
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:48,400
B divided

710
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:51,760
by probability of a given

711
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:55,920
C oops

712
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,920
probability of C

713
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:07,599
so does that make sense to

714
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,560
everybody and the reason that this might

715
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,520
you know this in particular might be

716
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,760
useful uh in order to compute the

717
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,160
probability of B you know if we uh use B

718
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,119
complement to C

719
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,119
right this right hand side here

720
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:31,240
does not depend on the probability of a

721
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,560
right like we don't have to compute the

722
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,520
probability of a so maybe if a is some

723
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,319
really nasty event right and we don't

724
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,400
actually want to compute its probability

725
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:41,079
but we can still condition on it we

726
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,040
might still be able to use this formula

727
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:47,160
more easily than we could use this

728
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,160
one okay does that make sense to

729
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:55,880
everybody

730
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:59,319
okay so let's take a look at a couple of

731
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,319
applications of BAS

732
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,680
R uh or actually

733
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,760
first first maybe I should uh give you a

734
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,319
brief lesson in

735
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,319
statistics uh so

736
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,839
terminology the probability of uh a

737
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,839
given

738
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:29,040
B uh this would often be called the

739
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,040
likelihood

740
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,119
of a given

741
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,119
B okay so if any of you have ever seen

742
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,440
like maximum likelihood estimations or

743
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,280
anything like that that's where this

744
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,319
comes from or this is where that comes

745
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:56,400
from

746
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:56,400
sorry uh probability of B

747
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,200
we call the prior

748
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:10,280
probability of

749
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,880
B and the left hand side the probability

750
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,880
of being given an

751
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,160
a is the posterior

752
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,680
of

753
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,119
B uh actually we don't usually specify a

754
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:43,560
with that

755
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,760
oops

756
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,400
okay so this is how you would normally

757
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,839
talk about it like in statistics or

758
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,920
something like that uh the the

759
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,319
likelihood of a given B the prior

760
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,920
probability and the posterior

761
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:56,720
probability because basically what

762
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,400
you're doing right is you're starting

763
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,400
with some prior right if you don't know

764
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,319
anything like this is kind of what you

765
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,839
think the the probability of B should be

766
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,480
and now you make some uh some

767
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:11,160
observation a right and so now you

768
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,440
update and you got a posterior

769
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:16,240
probability of B you know condition on

770
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,400
that that uh uh observation does that

771
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,400
make

772
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,520
sense

773
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:32,000
okay so why don't we take a look at a

774
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,000
couple of examples then

775
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:40,640
uh

776
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:45,880
here hopefully everybody is okay with

777
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,720
those okay so first example suppose I've

778
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,720
got two

779
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,559
coins okay uh I've got one Fair coin

780
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,359
right I toss this coin and it'll come up

781
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,760
heads with 50% probability tails with

782
00:42:54,359 --> 00:43:00,160
50% probability okay and I've also got a

783
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,480
trick coin right it's uh you know double

784
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,839
heads I flip it I always get

785
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,359
heads

786
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:08,839
okay uh suppose I pick one of these

787
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,040
coins uniformly at

788
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:14,800
random I flip that

789
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:18,160
coin and it comes up

790
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,319
heads okay what is the probability that

791
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:24,079
I picked the far coin to begin with as

792
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,079
opposed to the biased one

793
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:32,240
any ideas does anybody have any guesses

794
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:32,240
as to what the probability

795
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:41,240
is who wants to just dra draw the tree

796
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:43,280
diagram few people people aren't as

797
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:45,520
enthusiastic about it as as they were on

798
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,720
Tuesday that's uh that's slightly

799
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,920
unfortunate let's do it anyway uh no

800
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,040
let's let's first uh you know let's make

801
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:59,040
precise the events that we care about

802
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,040
okay um so let's let H be the event

803
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,079
uh that we flipped

804
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:14,800
heads uh and uh f is the

805
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,800
event picked the fa

806
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,160
coin

807
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:28,640
okay so what is the probability that

808
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,640
we're trying to compute

809
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,400
in terms of these two

810
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,400
quantities

811
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,599
yeah probability of f given H

812
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:48,920
yes

813
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:51,400
okay so how might we compute

814
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,920
this people didn't seem too enthusiastic

815
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:56,319
about the tree diagram so what else

816
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,319
could we do instead

817
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,119
does anybody see a way to use base

818
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,960
rule yeah or just a stretch

819
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:19,280
sorry

820
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:28,280
yeah yeah the probability of H given f

821
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:31,079
is easy right that's that's 50% okay so

822
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,200
that's that's an easy known quantity so

823
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:36,160
if we use base rule right that that

824
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,040
might make it easier to uh to compute

825
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:42,319
okay

826
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:43,680
so uh actually why don't we use the uh

827
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,160
you know slightly more complicated

828
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,960
version of Base rule so let's compute

829
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,800
the ratio of the probability that we

830
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,160
picked the faircoin given that we

831
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,319
observed a heads versus you know the the

832
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:58,640
probability of the of picking the biased

833
00:45:55,319 --> 00:46:01,400
coin given that we observed a heads

834
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,160
okay so the

835
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:11,839
probability of f given

836
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:11,839
H over probability of not F given

837
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:17,920
H so what was that

838
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,520
so right base rule is about you know

839
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:40,000
flipping the uh flipping the order right

840
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,680
so instead of f conditioned on H we want

841
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,440
H conditioned on

842
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,440
F multiplied by

843
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:56,880
what yeah yeah probability of f

844
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:05,599
okay and on the bottom we can do the

845
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:10,440
same thing probability of H given not

846
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,440
F times the probability of not

847
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,440
F

848
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:20,200
okay so this expression is much easier

849
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:24,119
to work with right what's the

850
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,119
probability of H given f

851
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:31,440
yep2

852
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:37,640
yeah okay what about the probability of

853
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,640
H given not

854
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,079
F yeah

855
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:47,200
one and probability of F and not

856
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:55,800
F those are each one half by assumption

857
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,800
okay

858
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,760
okay so those just cancel and we are

859
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,760
left

860
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,720
with2

861
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,240
okay so

862
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,240
now what is this

863
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:28,240
probability we computed the ratio of

864
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:30,680
this probability to its complement

865
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:33,240
right so what does that tell us the uh

866
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,240
probability

867
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:40,559
is yeah one3

868
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,680
yeah

869
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:03,680
okay so OB serve here that uh if our

870
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:06,440
prior changes right if the if the chance

871
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,799
that we are you know picking the fa coin

872
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:11,480
to begin with

873
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:12,839
changes uh this posterior probability

874
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,720
also

875
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:19,280
changes okay

876
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,559
so you know if if I if I originally

877
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,160
picked the Fair coin with very high

878
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:27,119
probability

879
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:28,760
right uh and then I observe a heads

880
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,760
right do you think the uh probability

881
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:35,160
that a the the posterior probability

882
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,160
should be the same higher or

883
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:46,599
lower oh yeah how did we get a third oh

884
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,119
question how did we get a

885
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:53,599
third uh so the ratio of this to its

886
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:57,520
complement is 12 right they sum to one

887
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,520
right so they're 1/3 and 2/3

888
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,400
okay

889
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:15,880
yeah the numerical values of h and

890
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:17,680
f uh so h and f are events they're not

891
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:21,799
uh they're not numbers

892
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:24,040
exactly right so you know H is the event

893
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:25,480
that you know whichever coin I flipped

894
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,640
uh I got a heads on

895
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:30,000
it right

896
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:32,119
and F is the event that the the coin I

897
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,359
picked was the Fair

898
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:38,119
one okay so they're not really numbers

899
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,040
they're just you know sets of outcomes

900
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:42,599
that could have

901
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:47,160
happened okay

902
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:50,319
yeah oh the assumptions right so um you

903
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:53,720
know pick uh

904
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,720
fair or

905
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:58,000
biased uh uniformly

906
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,079
and then uh flip

907
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:08,359
it so fair means it comes up with 5050

908
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,920
you know heads or tails biased it's a

909
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:12,920
two-headed

910
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,920
coin

911
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,839
okay

912
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:23,920
yeah uh explain where the one/ third

913
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:26,119
came from again okay so uh the

914
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,119
probability of f given H over not F

915
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:28,720
given h

916
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,559
right these are complimentary

917
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:35,760
probabilities they should sum to one

918
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:38,640
okay so we figured that the ratio right

919
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,640
is

920
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,559
uh2 okay so you know if we want them to

921
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:46,480
to sum to one then then they should be

922
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:50,599
1/3 and

923
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:53,079
2/3 okay does does that make sense

924
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:57,079
yeah

925
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:57,079
okay yeah

926
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:06,720
sorry oh question if it's biased do we

927
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,160
care in which direction it's biased uh

928
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,480
yes

929
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,040
absolutely so if it's you know a double

930
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,880
tailed coin instead of a double heads

931
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:16,640
coin right you know if I observe a heads

932
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,280
it must be the Fair coin right because

933
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:21,400
the the double Tales coin cannot get a

934
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,599
heads right so then my probability is

935
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,599
just one

936
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:37,480
okay are people reasonably happy with

937
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,720
this example shall we move on to a

938
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,720
second

939
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:47,040
one

940
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:50,280
okay second example Co testing woohoo

941
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,040
everybody loves Co testing right oh I

942
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,920
suppose you most of you probably weren't

943
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:57,359
here when there were those like you know

944
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:00,720
daily or near daily nasal swabs right

945
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:03,520
well those those were fun times okay

946
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,160
um so in the next next couple of

947
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,359
examples we're going to see some you

948
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:12,520
know rather counterintuitive behavior

949
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:15,160
that uh arises from base rule okay

950
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:17,359
so you know you just as we were

951
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:21,240
discussing last time you kind of want to

952
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:24,079
throw away uh intuitive reasoning and

953
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:27,680
you know just go with the numbers okay

954
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:27,680
so suppose

955
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,319
10% of

956
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,000
MIT has

957
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,799
Co

958
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:47,359
okay uh and everybody has to take a

959
00:53:43,799 --> 00:53:49,799
covid test okay uh they have a false

960
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:49,799
positive

961
00:53:55,319 --> 00:54:00,240
rate uh uh of uh

962
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:04,359
30% and false negative

963
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:16,079
rate of

964
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:19,240
10% okay so false positive rate means

965
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:22,599
you know uh if I'm am healthy and I take

966
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,760
a covid test there's a 30% chance that

967
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:27,160
it's going to be wrong and it's going to

968
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,880
say that I'm I have Co okay okay so it's

969
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,720
it's falsely reporting a positive

970
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,680
positive result uh and false negative is

971
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:36,720
the opposite so if I'm sick and I take a

972
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:38,160
covid test there is a 10% chance that it

973
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,839
does not detect it and it reports that

974
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,000
I'm

975
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:45,000
healthy okay do does the setup make

976
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
sense

977
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:51,839
yeah oh uh question was are the false

978
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,400
positives included in the 10% or is the

979
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:56,480
10% when you actually have it uh so this

980
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,359
10% is you know conditioned on being

981
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,160
sick okay the conditional probability

982
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:03,480
that it gets it wrong is

983
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:05,920
10% and the false positive rate is

984
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,280
conditioned on being oh sorry false

985
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,000
negative is conditioned on being healthy

986
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,760
false positive is conditioned on being

987
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,280
sick

988
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,119
no no positive positive is sick yeah it

989
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:18,880
was right the first time sorry I'm I'm

990
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:20,880
confused uh yeah so these are both

991
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,160
talking about conditional probabilities

992
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,599
okay conditioned on being healthy or

993
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,440
sick what's the probability that the

994
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,440
test is accurate or wrong

995
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:36,839
okay so let's define some

996
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,839
events let's say that H is you know

997
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:43,200
healthy uh and S can be its

998
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:52,079
complement

999
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,079
sick uh plus is going to be positive

1000
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,240
result and minus is going to be a

1001
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,240
negative

1002
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,720
result

1003
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:10,240
okay so suppose I take this covid test

1004
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,920
and it comes out

1005
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:15,280
positive okay what's the probability

1006
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,280
that I have

1007
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:27,240
covid so first what is the probability

1008
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,240
that we're trying to compute

1009
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:39,160
yeah probability of

1010
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,359
s

1011
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:51,480
unconditionally yeah so s given positive

1012
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:54,160
right the unconditional probability of s

1013
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,599
is just 10% by assumption okay what

1014
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,520
we're actually looking for is the

1015
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:00,559
probability of uh probability that I'm

1016
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:03,119
sick given that I tested positive okay

1017
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:09,079
because that's the observation that we

1018
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:09,079
made okay so how would we compute

1019
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,039
this well let's do the same thing we

1020
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:14,039
just did over

1021
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:22,559
here let's look at the ratio of this

1022
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
probability to its

1023
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:28,480
complement

1024
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,319
okay and and applies apply base

1025
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,480
rule so we're going to flip this uh

1026
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:36,280
conditional

1027
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:38,319
here positive given sick times

1028
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:43,039
probability of

1029
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:44,240
sick divided by probability of positive

1030
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:49,480
given

1031
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:49,480
healthy times probability of

1032
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,799
healthy

1033
00:57:52,960 --> 00:58:00,440
okay now those four probabilities are

1034
00:57:55,799 --> 00:58:00,440
probab that we know okay what are

1035
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,400
they what's the probability of plus

1036
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,400
given that I'm

1037
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,280
sick

1038
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:21,440
yeah yeah

1039
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:21,440
90% so let's write that as 0.

1040
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:28,119
n what's the uh prior probability that

1041
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,119
I'm sick

1042
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:32,319
yeah 10

1043
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:40,160
10% and now what's the probability of a

1044
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,160
positive result condition on being

1045
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:51,280
healthy

1046
00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:51,280
yeah yeah that's the false positive

1047
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:56,480
rate3 times and what's the probability

1048
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,680
that I'm healthy the prior probility of

1049
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,680
I'm

1050
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,440
healthy well that's just going to be the

1051
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,880
complement of the uh the event that I'm

1052
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,240
sick so that's going to

1053
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:16,280
be.

1054
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:20,200
n okay so these NS

1055
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,200
cancel this is going to be

1056
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:27,559
1/3 okay so I am 1/3 as likely to be

1057
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,200
sick as healthy so the probability that

1058
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:33,039
I'm sick condition on getting the

1059
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,640
positive result is actually only one and

1060
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:36,920
four

1061
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:40,599
okay

1062
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:44,920
so probability s given

1063
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:44,920
plus equals

1064
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:53,520
1/4 does that make sense to

1065
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:57,079
everybody so it might seem a little bit

1066
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,440
weird right like uh uh you know this

1067
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:00,440
this test is a pretty good one right

1068
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,280
like it's usually giving the right

1069
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:05,440
answer but you know I took the test I

1070
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:09,440
got a positive result but I'm still

1071
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,440
probably healthy why is

1072
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:15,799
that can anybody explain what's going on

1073
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:15,799
here

1074
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:23,119
yeah yeah exactly so that there's a very

1075
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:24,400
slim chance that I'd Co to begin with so

1076
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,480
it's actually much higher now that I've

1077
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:30,119
got a positive result but the uh the the

1078
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,720
prior was kind of overwhelmingly in

1079
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:35,720
favor of being healthy and so it's still

1080
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,400
you know very likely that I'm healthy

1081
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:41,160
just you know slightly less

1082
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:44,200
so okay so often people kind of

1083
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:48,319
underestimate the uh uh the impact of

1084
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:51,000
the prior in this way okay uh of course

1085
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:53,280
in the real world you generally don't uh

1086
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,160
do this so if you get a positive result

1087
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,680
uh you can be more confident in it

1088
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:59,839
because you know normally you only test

1089
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:02,119
when you have symptoms right so the

1090
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:03,839
probability that you uh uh that you're

1091
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:05,960
sick given that you tested positive and

1092
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,319
you have symptoms that's probably going

1093
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:10,319
to be much higher than

1094
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:10,319
1/4

1095
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:20,240
okay are people happy with

1096
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:23,319
that yeah

1097
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:25,119
okay why don't we look at another

1098
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:27,920
interesting application called Simpsons

1099
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,920
paradox

1100
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:41,480
okay so there's actually kind of a funny

1101
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:45,960
story behind this one uh so about 50

1102
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:49,240
years ago uh Berkeley UC Berkeley got

1103
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,760
sued right because uh you know that it

1104
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:53,000
was claimed that they were being very

1105
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:56,480
sexist in their admissions

1106
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,680
policies um and

1107
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,880
uh you know the

1108
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:02,760
claim was that the admissions rate was

1109
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:05,599
much higher for men than it was for

1110
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:08,359
women right so you know that's that's

1111
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,200
clearly bad right but then Berkeley

1112
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:12,000
counter claimed by saying that if you

1113
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,760
look at each individual Department it's

1114
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,039
actually the opposite like women are

1115
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,160
being admitted uh with much higher rates

1116
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:20,559
than

1117
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:24,440
men right so

1118
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:27,839
um what's going on was somebody lying

1119
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,839
can these both be true

1120
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:31,240
any

1121
01:02:31,279 --> 01:02:34,279
ideas

1122
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:42,559
yeah yeah exactly so the uh the the

1123
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,200
observation right was that the sizes of

1124
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:48,599
the Departments could be very different

1125
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,599
right and what

1126
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,640
else

1127
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,039
yeah yeah so the the the admissions

1128
01:02:55,319 --> 01:02:58,599
rates like the the the overall

1129
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:02,520
admissions rates for the Departments can

1130
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:05,240
also be very different right and so you

1131
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:07,279
know maybe you know there's some

1132
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,880
departments like you know let's let's

1133
01:03:07,279 --> 01:03:11,559
take a look at a very simple example

1134
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,799
okay so suppose we have two departments

1135
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:15,559
e and

1136
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:19,400
CS

1137
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:22,920
okay right uh and you

1138
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:27,520
know maybe both of them mildly favor

1139
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:29,119
women okay but uh uh you know one of

1140
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:31,480
them is much more popular with men one

1141
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:33,680
of them is much more popular with women

1142
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:35,279
and they have very different admissions

1143
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,960
rates you know

1144
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:40,400
generally

1145
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:43,880
okay so

1146
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:46,279
maybe uh we have a 100 men and 100 women

1147
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,520
applying to you know this two Department

1148
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:49,119
UC

1149
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:53,240
Berkeley

1150
01:03:49,119 --> 01:04:00,079
okay and uh maybe we have

1151
01:03:53,240 --> 01:04:04,279
99 uh women and one man apply to

1152
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:05,000
Cs and in we it's the opposite one woman

1153
01:04:04,279 --> 01:04:07,279
and

1154
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,279
99

1155
01:04:07,279 --> 01:04:10,279
men

1156
01:04:10,359 --> 01:04:15,119
okay and

1157
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:18,160
maybe

1158
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:20,039
uh in CS we're a bunch of snobs right we

1159
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:24,000
we hate everybody we take one

1160
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:25,839
applicant okay so maybe we take you know

1161
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,799
one woman

1162
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:31,760
is

1163
01:04:27,799 --> 01:04:34,720
accepted everybody else is rejected

1164
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:36,039
okay uh and dou on the other hand has no

1165
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,359
standards at all they'll just take

1166
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:40,079
anybody with a pulse uh but

1167
01:04:38,359 --> 01:04:43,039
unfortunately one of these men is dead

1168
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:45,079
so uh you know they take one woman and

1169
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:48,079
98

1170
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:48,079
men

1171
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:55,160
okay so now if you look at the

1172
01:04:52,359 --> 01:04:57,319
individual Department's admissions rates

1173
01:04:55,160 --> 01:05:00,160
right

1174
01:04:57,319 --> 01:05:01,920
uh CS has accepted a woman right so

1175
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:04,240
their their admissions rate for women is

1176
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,880
you know nonzero they haven't accepted

1177
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,960
any men so they've got a zero admissions

1178
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,799
rate for

1179
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:13,920
men so it's higher for

1180
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:16,480
women right and in E they've accepted

1181
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,920
all of the women but not all of the men

1182
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,119
so again it's higher for women but if

1183
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:24,640
you look at what's happened overall

1184
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:27,640
right we've got two women being accepted

1185
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,640
and 98 men

1186
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:33,200
right so you can kind of argue that you

1187
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,359
know rather than being a problem with

1188
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:37,880
the

1189
01:05:34,359 --> 01:05:41,240
university uh or or the Departments it's

1190
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:43,279
kind of more of a systemic problem like

1191
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:45,440
uh you know maybe they're you know

1192
01:05:43,279 --> 01:05:47,119
encouraging men and women to apply to uh

1193
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,480
different departments at different rates

1194
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:54,119
and uh you know it's all a bit messy and

1195
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:55,400
uh you know also this is 50 years ago so

1196
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:57,799
you know they only really considered men

1197
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:00,720
and women women didn't really you know

1198
01:05:57,799 --> 01:06:02,880
consider anybody who you know identified

1199
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,599
as anything else but you know we're not

1200
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:08,000
saying anything about that this is just

1201
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:10,039
kind of uh to illustrate the math so

1202
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,680
hopefully it's not terribly

1203
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:17,359
offensive but yeah uh even though for

1204
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:19,279
each department the the women are doing

1205
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:21,559
better than men the men are doing much

1206
01:06:19,279 --> 01:06:23,720
better overall okay so that's what we

1207
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:25,599
call simp Simpsons

1208
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:28,200
Paradox does anybody have any question

1209
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,200
questions about

1210
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:39,960
that

1211
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:39,960
okay so last

1212
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:51,119
example has anybody seen the dragon

1213
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:53,359
prins couple of hands okay well so last

1214
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:56,440
example uh suppose a cake has gone

1215
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:59,599
missing from the bakery and and uh you

1216
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,640
know barus the baker has has a prime

1217
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,520
suspect right he thinks that Prince ezin

1218
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,799
stole the

1219
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:07,400
cake

1220
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:09,720
uh and you know he wants to present

1221
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:13,200
evidence to the

1222
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:16,000
king he would like to tell the king that

1223
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:17,359
you know this this uh this deviant is

1224
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,760
always stealing jelly Tarts from my

1225
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:21,480
bakery you know that makes it much more

1226
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,480
likely that he stole the cake right like

1227
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:27,240
jelly tart thieves are you know 10 times

1228
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:29,640
as likely as randos to to steal cakes

1229
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:31,480
okay it seems Seems fairly reasonable

1230
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:33,799
right does does anybody think that this

1231
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:36,400
is a good reason to uh admit the jelly

1232
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:38,160
tart thevery into uh into

1233
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,279
evidence who thinks that it's not a

1234
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:42,799
compelling

1235
01:07:40,279 --> 01:07:47,319
reason well who has no

1236
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:49,599
idea morans okay so uh maybe Prince

1237
01:07:47,319 --> 01:07:52,079
cen's counter claim

1238
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:54,640
is well if you look at you know all

1239
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:57,680
jelly tart thieves you know only one in

1240
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:02,039
say 2500 of them actually go on to Steel

1241
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:04,440
cakes so like you know even though the

1242
01:08:02,039 --> 01:08:06,440
probability of you know being a cake

1243
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:08,319
thief has you know increased

1244
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:11,039
dramatically from from the the Baseline

1245
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:12,880
in terms of like a multiplicative Factor

1246
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:14,760
it can't actually have increased very

1247
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,560
much because you know it went from 1

1248
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:20,040
125,000 to 1

1249
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:22,719
12500 right so the uh the probative

1250
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,759
value here is you know essentially zero

1251
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:26,279
right you're you're trying to prove

1252
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:29,679
guilt Beyond A Reasonable Doubt

1253
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:31,960
right and so a 1 in 2500 chance increase

1254
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:33,920
is kind of negligible but on the other

1255
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,799
hand you know if you admit this into

1256
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,520
evidence the king is going to be biased

1257
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:39,000
against ezren right he's going to be

1258
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,839
like oh this kid's a thief this is

1259
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,920
terrible we got to punish him right

1260
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:44,920
regardless of whether he stole the

1261
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:53,199
cake so uh so who's right is is the

1262
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,199
baker right or is the uh is the suspect

1263
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,920
right who thinks Baker is

1264
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:05,220
right who think suspect is

1265
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:08,080
right who thinks

1266
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:11,400
[Laughter]

1267
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:13,759
neither yeah I've got a few HS

1268
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:18,400
okay so

1269
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:19,679
um well both parties here are trying to

1270
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:23,319
reason

1271
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:25,679
about uh a conditional

1272
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:27,960
probability okay what is that

1273
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:27,960
conditional

1274
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,600
probability

1275
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,600
anybody well maybe we should start by

1276
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:44,279
writing out some

1277
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:49,279
events

1278
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:50,609
so let's let J be the event

1279
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:51,799
suspect

1280
01:09:50,609 --> 01:09:56,159
[Music]

1281
01:09:51,799 --> 01:09:56,159
steals jelly tarts

1282
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:03,120
uh C can be the event suspect steals

1283
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:15,159
cake and X can be the event cake was

1284
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:25,520
stolen

1285
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:28,120
okay so both the Baker and the suspect

1286
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,199
we making claims about conditional

1287
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:32,400
probabilities what specific conditional

1288
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:35,199
probability in terms of these events

1289
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,199
were they making claims

1290
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:52,480
about

1291
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:55,920
yeah

1292
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:58,320
sorry uh repeat the assertions oh the

1293
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,560
assumptions uh so the assumptions were

1294
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,920
right that a cake has gone missing from

1295
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:06,400
the bakery the baker has a prime suspect

1296
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:08,880
okay and the the Baker wants to admit

1297
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:12,840
into evidence that this suspect is

1298
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:16,760
always stealing jelly Tarts okay and the

1299
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:19,000
reasoning is that uh you know jelly tart

1300
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:22,040
thieves are much more likely to steal

1301
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:26,480
cakes than you know random other

1302
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:29,360
people okay and the suspect counters by

1303
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:31,480
saying well sure but like only one in

1304
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:35,400
2500 jelly tart thieves is actually a

1305
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:39,239
cake thief right so you know the actual

1306
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:41,000
increase is less than 1 in

1307
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:43,120
2500

1308
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,480
okay so what are the probabilities that

1309
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,800
they're reasoning about what are the

1310
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,800
conditional

1311
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:52,760
probabilities yeah

1312
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:03,040
yeah well you're both right sorry it's

1313
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:07,840
um geometry they're both trying to

1314
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:10,880
reason about probability of C given J

1315
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:13,560
right you know so we're conditioning on

1316
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,360
the suspect having stolen jelly Tarts

1317
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:18,080
and they're both trying to make claims

1318
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:21,080
about you know what is the probability

1319
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,080
of C conditioned on

1320
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:29,480
that okay

1321
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:33,639
so well the baker is arguing that

1322
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:37,679
probability of C given J divided by

1323
01:12:33,639 --> 01:12:41,000
probability of C given not

1324
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:42,840
J is

1325
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,320
high

1326
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:48,880
right so you know because this is you

1327
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:50,960
know about 10 J is very relevant to the

1328
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:54,600
case so it should be

1329
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:55,639
admitted okay uh the suspect is saying

1330
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,520
that

1331
01:12:55,639 --> 01:13:02,719
probability of C given

1332
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:06,760
J is low

1333
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:09,639
right so J cannot actually uh

1334
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:11,800
dramatically increase the

1335
01:13:09,639 --> 01:13:14,639
probability right the increase is going

1336
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,639
to be less than this

1337
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:21,480
probability yeah

1338
01:13:39,719 --> 01:13:45,159
yeah so that's a good point um so the

1339
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,159
the point was that we're we're talking

1340
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:50,280
about you know one individual suspect

1341
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:52,760
one individual cake one individual case

1342
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:54,840
right so kind of as we were saying

1343
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:57,760
before when we first uh started looking

1344
01:13:54,840 --> 01:14:00,280
at rule like you know either it happened

1345
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,280
or it didn't right like you could say

1346
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:04,320
that it doesn't make a whole lot of

1347
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,960
sense to talk about probabilities right

1348
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,560
but you know you're trying to convince

1349
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:12,120
you know the king or a jury or somebody

1350
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:14,159
right um so this is kind of you know

1351
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:16,920
similar to when you present DNA evidence

1352
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:18,400
in court or something like that uh like

1353
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,400
the fact that there's a match means that

1354
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,199
there's you know overwhelming

1355
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:22,400
probability that the uh the suspect was

1356
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:24,679
at the crime scene or something like

1357
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:26,639
that right so like you you do kind of

1358
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:29,080
still talk about

1359
01:14:26,639 --> 01:14:30,520
probabilities uh but you could think of

1360
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:32,560
it as like you know how confident are

1361
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:37,000
you in the inference that uh that the

1362
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:37,000
suspect did something does that make

1363
01:14:38,199 --> 01:14:41,199
sense

1364
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,600
okay

1365
01:14:50,679 --> 01:14:57,080
okay

1366
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:58,920
so so if you were the judge in this case

1367
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,560
determining what should be presented to

1368
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:03,480
the

1369
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:03,480
king what would your verdict

1370
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:10,120
be do do we allow jelly tart thievery

1371
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:13,760
into evidence or

1372
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:15,960
no pardon draw a tree diagram draw a

1373
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,159
tree diagram uh well that's not actually

1374
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:20,080
necessary anymore we've already figured

1375
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:23,320
out what the uh probabilities are the uh

1376
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:26,600
question is um you know is the probative

1377
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:29,440
value good enough to justify you know

1378
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:32,000
putting it into evidence or is the

1379
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:34,040
probative value small enough that the uh

1380
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,040
bias is going to be more more of a

1381
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,040
factor

1382
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:47,960
yeah oh

1383
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:06,600
yeah so it it it will not you know

1384
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,120
generally capture the full story and

1385
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,320
this is why you know lawyers in a

1386
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:12,480
courtroom are you know trying to find

1387
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,840
all kinds of evidence to uh to bolster

1388
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:16,679
their cases so yeah like something like

1389
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:19,120
that might be something that the uh the

1390
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:21,840
defense would want to uh would want to

1391
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:23,920
present um or the prosecution might be

1392
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,800
like oh but even though it's an MIT

1393
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:29,440
student like it's an it eecs student who

1394
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,920
do steel cakes all the time

1395
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:32,500
so I'm getting some uh some nods That's

1396
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,800
mildly

1397
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:38,280
[Laughter]

1398
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:39,560
concerning so uh you know like yeah it's

1399
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:42,440
going to be very difficult to capture

1400
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:44,520
the entire picture um for right now

1401
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,960
we're just trying to limit the scope to

1402
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,880
like these are these are the things that

1403
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,320
are known right we we know that a cake

1404
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:52,440
is stolen we know that this suspect

1405
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:54,199
steals jelly Tarts uh but that's it like

1406
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:56,159
we we want to try and figure out you

1407
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:59,440
know what the the probative value of

1408
01:16:56,159 --> 01:17:02,679
this evidence is uh just based on

1409
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:05,239
those does that make

1410
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:07,320
sense so who thinks who thinks the jelly

1411
01:17:05,239 --> 01:17:10,800
tart should be

1412
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,800
admitted who thinks

1413
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:16,440
no okay I'm I'm I'm getting more hands

1414
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:18,280
this time less extensions okay does

1415
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:22,280
anybody want to say

1416
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:22,280
why yeah

1417
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:34,080
mhm yeah so the the observation rate was

1418
01:17:32,679 --> 01:17:36,320
uh you know the probability of C given

1419
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:39,360
not J is also very low right and in fact

1420
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:42,040
it is much lower than than C given J um

1421
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:44,239
so that's kind of where this this uh the

1422
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:47,600
the ratio there probability of C given J

1423
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:50,239
over C given not J is coming from right

1424
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:52,880
like uh probability of C given J is 1

1425
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:53,679
and 2500 probability of C given not J is

1426
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,440
1 and

1427
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:56,679
25,000 right so that's where you're

1428
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:59,920
getting this factor of

1429
01:17:56,679 --> 01:18:01,360
10 so you you agree with the uh the

1430
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,840
defense that this should not be ad

1431
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:07,360
admitted into evidence okay does anybody

1432
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:07,360
have any Contra

1433
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:12,719
claims

1434
01:18:19,239 --> 01:18:22,239
yeah

1435
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,960
yeah yeah so that's a good point we've

1436
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:29,360
uh we've kind of forgotten about

1437
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,360
something

1438
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,880
right a cake was stolen right we don't

1439
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:39,000
care that the probability of cakes being

1440
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:42,000
stolen is low it it

1441
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:44,480
happened right

1442
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,679
so you know we we we don't really care

1443
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:49,840
about these probabilities at all what is

1444
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:49,840
the actual probability we care

1445
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:59,400
about what we really want is is

1446
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:59,400
probability of C given

1447
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,560
what

1448
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:14,480
yeah well not that they stole a cake but

1449
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:16,520
that a cake was stolen yeah so C given j

1450
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:19,400
and

1451
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:22,360
x okay so that's what we really care

1452
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:24,320
about right uh that the fact that the

1453
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,560
cake is stolen is really important right

1454
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:27,639
like if

1455
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,880
uh no if you don't know whether the cake

1456
01:19:27,639 --> 01:19:31,000
is stolen right why are you even having

1457
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,000
a

1458
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:38,600
trial and as it turns out this

1459
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,600
probability is something like

1460
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:44,480
80% jelly tart thieves founded bakeries

1461
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:46,800
with missing cakes usually they're the

1462
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,800
guilty

1463
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:51,840
party um

1464
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:54,480
so yeah I've kind of made this a little

1465
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,239
bit more palatable but uh this is uh you

1466
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:59,480
know based on an actual courtroom case

1467
01:19:57,239 --> 01:20:01,719
um like this this is the kind of thing

1468
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:04,120
that that people uh you know like people

1469
01:20:01,719 --> 01:20:05,199
try and use and you know end up misusing

1470
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,280
probabilities and conditional

1471
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:09,320
probabilities all the time this was

1472
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:13,840
actually from a very high-profile case

1473
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:15,560
the OJ Simpson case um where both the

1474
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:17,120
defense and the prosecution attorneys

1475
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:19,239
like you know they're supposed to be

1476
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:21,600
experts uh but you know they were both

1477
01:20:19,239 --> 01:20:22,480
making bogus claims about uh about

1478
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,960
conditional

1479
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:26,920
probabilities uh you know it's it's very

1480
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,199
easy to make these kinds of mistakes so

1481
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:30,639
you know fall back on fundamentals uh

1482
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:32,040
when you're an adult fall back on the

1483
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:34,400
fundamentals even if you're not it's

1484
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,440
probably a good idea anyway okay uh feel

1485
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,480
free to come up if you have any

1486
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:40,840
questions and uh otherwise we will see

1487
01:20:37,480 --> 01:20:40,840
you next week
