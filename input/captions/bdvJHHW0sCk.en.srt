1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,439
Look, I

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,240
think it's just because everyone is

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,519
graduating after

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:17,160
graduating which is good. So I can go to

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,160
all of them but also bad basically every

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,039
also graduating.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,760
Yeah.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,559
So, he's going to have Is there any

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,480
special event

10
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:39,520
for graduates? I guess not. Senior week.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,520
You're doing great. If I can have your

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,040
attention, please.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,480
So, first I just wanted to say thank you

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,559
to all of you for coming to this event

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,079
for fusion energy week. As most of you

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,160
know, this is somewhat the beginning of

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,480
my career here at MIT and certainly my

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,000
first fusion energy week. I was very

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,600
nervous about planning this. So, I'm

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,520
very grateful to see such an

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,559
enthusiastic audience both here and

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,840
those of us on Zoom. So, thank you to

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,879
all of you for coming and making this

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,040
event wonderful. And thank you to Alex

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,960
and Maria who agreed to give us an

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,040
amazing presentation and who got us that

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,320
pizza or worked for us to get the plot

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,240
for the pizza. You're welcome for the

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,680
pizza. Um, all right. Uh, let's go ahead

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,000
and get started. So, those uh who are

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,439
offsite, I hope you could get pizza for

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
yourselves at home or wherever you're

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,200
at. Uh today, Maria and I are going to

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,439
put on a a boxing match of sorts. Uh you

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,119
know, the race to fusion energy, magnets

36
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,159
versus lasers. Um right, and you know,

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,320
kicking off fusion energy week. Um we

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,320
had a similar type of presentation about

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,640
a year ago now at the MIT Energy

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,720
Conference. And so, uh, we've kind of

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,600
reprised our roles, revamped the slides

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,520
a bit. Um, and, uh, we hope you enjoy.

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,119
Also, I just want to say we recognize a

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,280
lot of familiar faces here in the

45
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,079
audience. So, for those folks who know

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,759
things about magnetic fusion energy,

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,320
like my part is probably be pretty

48
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,159
boring for you. Uh, and then for those a

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,720
lot of my part you'll have heard before.

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,720
Yeah. Yeah. This is a really sort of

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,680
intro to fusion and hopefully a lot of

52
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,760
folks um online will also get a lot out

53
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,599
of this. Uh, and then maybe we'll hold

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,920
questions until the very end, but we

55
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,400
should have plenty of time to do Q&A and

56
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,319
stuff. So, this will be the third time

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,879
we battle this out, Alex, I think. Oh,

58
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,840
third time. Okay, nice. Yeah. All right.

59
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,360
And you've won every time. All

60
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,800
right. Um, okay. So, for those of you

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,239
who don't know me, maybe some people

62
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,560
offline. I'm Maria Gota Johnson. Um,

63
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,720
this kind of my introduction slide. So I

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,200
do nuclear diagnostics for inertia

65
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,560
infusion and high energy density science

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,440
which is where I will be talking about

67
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,760
the laser part throughout this talk. Um

68
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,160
I got my PhD from UPS university in

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,840
Sweden in 2010 in applied nuclear

70
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,599
physics and back then I was actually

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,920
working on magnetic confinement fusion.

72
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,760
So this is the instrument that I built

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,920
in grad school the time of flight

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,640
optimized for rate or to neutron

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,080
spectrometer. Look at DD neutrons and

76
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,720
it's illustrated with the inside of the

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,519
jet to mech right there. uh but now and

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,720
then I uh did my postto here at MIT uh

79
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,959
from 2010 to 2013 working on this

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,280
magnetic recall neutron spectrometer at

81
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,800
the national facility which looks like

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,879
that this is that's the actual detector

83
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,959
um and I've been working that's been

84
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,000
part of my role ever since I really

85
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,519
analyzed a lot of MR

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
data this is a picture from our lab

87
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,920
across the street in NW21 where we do

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,959
all the diagnostic development as a

89
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,720
group for the national ignition facility

90
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,760
in the Bmore in California. I'll show

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,239
you some pictures from there and for the

92
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,720
Omega laser in Rochester in upstate New

93
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,000
York and also for the Z machine and also

94
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,159
starting to do it for some private

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,239
fusion companies now. So diagnostic

96
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,680
development is our focus and this lab in

97
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,680
NW1 is where we enjoy showing this

98
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,680
picture.

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,400
Fighter number one, fighter number two.

100
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,799
Uh my name is Alex Tingley. I'm a

101
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,720
research scientist here. Uh also a group

102
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,760
leader in energetic particles in

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,440
magnetic fusion plasmas. I did my PhD

104
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,400
here um now started 10 over 10 years ago

105
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,479
and I worked on the Alcatore CEO tokmac

106
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,560
and so for those people who don't know

107
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,479
what a tokamac is we I will talk about

108
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,280
that but you can see this picture on the

109
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,360
left the inside of alcator cmod and sort

110
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,199
of a picture of me working inside the

111
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,680
tokamac and and then me standing outside

112
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,080
the tokamac on the bottom. Um then I

113
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,400
went to Jet uh into the UK for my

114
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,880
posttock for a few years and so here's a

115
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,280
picture of me standing on top of Jet and

116
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,680
you can then see inside of Jet. Uh and

117
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,120
then I came back to MIT um where as I

118
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,680
said I'm a research scientist. I

119
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,240
primarily work on the spark tokamac and

120
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,160
again we'll talk about each of these. Um

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,400
and uh here you can see inside the

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,720
tokamac hall for spark and in the sort

123
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,600
of magenta box on the other side of

124
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,759
those those holes were inside this room

125
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,240
here which is the neutron lab and I I

126
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,000
mainly work on neutron diagnostics and

127
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,320
fast ions and and electrons and fusion

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,840
plasmas. Um but why do we do the work

129
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,520
that we do? Um well I mean first fusion

130
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,160
would be a pretty amazing human

131
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,120
achievement but there is sort of a a

132
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,280
more um you know valuable role that

133
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,720
fusion can play in the world today. So

134
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,600
uh when Marie and I were making this

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:36,720
presentation um now a few years ago uh

136
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,240
we got this data um on um the climate

137
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,479
change and the and the world warming.

138
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,759
And so here you can see the very sad

139
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,320
graph of uh 50 years of the temperature

140
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,360
getting hotter and hotter. Um, and then,

141
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,280
um, here's a global map of of the

142
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,280
temperatures across the world being, uh,

143
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,600
in white is average, and then all the

144
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,120
red is is above average with the the

145
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
darkest red being the record warmest.

146
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,080
So, back in 2023, you can see a lot of

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,960
red and a lot of dark red splotches. So,

148
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,600
that that is not good. Um, and I've just

149
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,280
updated this for 2025. Uh, you know,

150
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,880
things do look a little better. There's

151
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,919
there's a little more white, but there's

152
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,840
still a lot of red. Um, and so we are

153
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,240
looking for a clean energy source that

154
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,720
is not carbon producing to help combat

155
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,600
climate

156
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,360
change. Um, and so here's Bill Gates who

157
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,080
maybe said it best. We need an energy

158
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,440
miracle. Uh, what could that be? Uh,

159
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,479
this is the the cover of uh, time where

160
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,680
fusion is unlimited energy for everyone

161
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,120
forever. Sounds pretty cool, right? So,

162
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,800
and then actually the little tagline

163
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,319
there, it might actually work this time.

164
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,639
So, you know,

165
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,919
That's also nice.

166
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,520
So, uh let's get into what is fusion. Um

167
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,919
so, what we're doing in fusion is we're

168
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,240
taking uh the atomic nuclei. So, in all

169
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,160
your atoms, you have in the center a

170
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,240
positively charged nucleus and we're

171
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,360
taking that nucleus, so two light

172
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,199
elements like these two light hydrogen

173
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,400
nuclei here, and we're forcing them

174
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,240
together. And if you bring them close

175
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,080
enough together with enough energy, they

176
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,199
will actually stick together. they'll

177
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,800
fuse into a new element and release a

178
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,199
lot of energy. So you can see that now

179
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,280
these two types of hydrogen come

180
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,280
together helium nucleus flies out and

181
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,520
then also a neutron comes out and we

182
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,000
want to basically harness that energy in

183
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,639
fusion. Uh where does that energy come

184
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,400
from? Uh well if you actually weigh the

185
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,919
the different components here. So the

186
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,919
two types of hydrogen which are on the

187
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,319
left the dutyium and tridium if you

188
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,800
weigh those before they react they are a

189
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,440
little bit heavier than the products the

190
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,599
neutron and the helium nucleus. So that

191
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,080
really tiny mass difference actually

192
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,440
gets changed into energy by Einstein's

193
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,680
famous equation E= MC^2. And the speed

194
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,120
of light is huge. So the C^2 is huge and

195
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,919
that's how you get a lot of energy out

196
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,319
of this. So the basic idea for what we

197
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,720
want to do for fusion on Earth is number

198
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,800
one, heat our fuel enough to turn it

199
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,360
into a plasma and have our fusion

200
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,520
reactions start occurring. Number two,

201
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,680
for this particular type of fusion,

202
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,280
those helium particles that are created,

203
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,759
we want them to stick around and

204
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,440
continue to heat the plasma as well to

205
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,000
keep our plasma hot, to keep the fusion

206
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,240
reactions going. And then number three,

207
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,560
the neutron that flies out, we want to

208
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,800
capture that energy and basically use it

209
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,400
to heat up water, turn water into steam

210
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,319
that goes through a steam cycle and

211
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,479
generates electricity. So in a way, it's

212
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,200
very similar to how electricity is

213
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,599
currently generated around the world. Uh

214
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,399
the parameter that we like to define is

215
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,080
Q and that's the energy out divided by

216
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,599
energy in. And so we want that to be

217
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,680
much greater than what we want to be

218
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,240
producing a lot more fusion power than

219
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,839
we're using for heating power. And so

220
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,000
throughout this talk we'll we'll touch

221
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,360
on the Q values uh for some of the

222
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
magnetic fusion and then also for um the

223
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,279
uh laser

224
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,920
fusion. So there are three main

225
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,240
approaches to confining a fusion plasma.

226
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,920
Um and and these are the most studied.

227
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,440
There are a lot of companies we'll

228
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,200
actually highlight companies at the end

229
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,560
of this talk and so a lot of different

230
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,560
strategies but these are kind of the

231
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,320
three main ones. Um there's

232
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,720
gravitational confinement, magnetic

233
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,240
confinement and inertial confinement. Uh

234
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,880
gravitational confinement has been

235
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,320
around for a long

236
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,120
time. Uh yeah. So you know basically

237
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:27,040
that's how stars work, right? Uh so all

238
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,800
stars are fusion reactors. Uh and so you

239
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,800
need something that is the size of the

240
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,160
sun in order to have your fusion

241
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,080
reactions occur in. Then we uh have

242
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,839
magnetic confinement which is what I'm

243
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,600
going to talk about. Uh and inertial

244
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,959
confinement is sort of the laser side

245
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,800
and that's what Maria's going to talk

246
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,040
about.

247
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,279
uh the different types of scales that

248
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,080
are required for each of these um are

249
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,720
pretty dramatic. So uh in the sun the

250
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,560
density that's that's n there um is

251
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,480
really really high in the core of the

252
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,839
sun and the temperature is also very hot

253
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,320
10 million degrees approximately. Um now

254
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,800
you need your particles to basically

255
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,399
kind of stay around in the same place

256
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,240
for long enough to get fusion reactions

257
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,920
to occur. And the time scales that we're

258
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,920
looking at for the sun are on on the

259
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,839
order of 10,000 years. But when you know

260
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,360
the sun is billions of years old, you

261
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,839
have a lot of time for these fusion

262
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,839
reactions to be occurring. For magnetic

263
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,640
confinement on the other hand, uh we are

264
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,120
much lower density. So about 12 orders

265
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,959
of magnitude lower. Um our temperatures

266
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,959
are about 10 times hotter than the

267
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,360
center of the sun, which is a huge

268
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,279
challenge for fusion here on Earth. And

269
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,279
our time scales are much more normal to

270
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,000
what humans are used to. So around a

271
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,399
second. Uh inertial confinement. Uh

272
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,839
we'll have Maria explain more later. The

273
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,120
densities are actually similar to the

274
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,800
sun. So they're basically creating

275
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,079
little tiny stars or at least that's how

276
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,079
I describe it. I don't know if you would

277
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,240
describe it that way. Temperatures are

278
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,160
similar around 100 million degrees. And

279
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,920
time scales are really, really, really

280
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,959
short. And so I think Maria will talk

281
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,279
more about that

282
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:01,360
later. So I am going to focus now on

283
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,839
magnetic fusion. And this is the jet

284
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,279
tokamac if it was made out of glass. Uh

285
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,079
which is kind of a cool picture to

286
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:12,800
see. So what is a tokamac? Basically, we

287
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,800
are trying to trap our fusion plasma in

288
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,839
a magnetic donut shaped bottle. So, we

289
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,560
see our pink plasma donut on the left

290
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,800
and the black line there is our magnetic

291
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,360
field line. And our charged particles,

292
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,800
those uh nuclei that want to fuse, they

293
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,240
want to follow those magnetic field

294
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,160
lines. And in here, they're actually

295
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,600
making little tiny spirals around the

296
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,600
field lines. And those field lines are

297
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,040
wrapping around on themselves. So, these

298
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,200
particles basically will just move

299
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,800
around in a circle forever. and they

300
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,120
keep colliding with each other over and

301
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,079
over and over until sometimes they'll

302
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,480
fuse together. Um, on this video on the

303
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,600
right, I want to demonstrate how a

304
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,519
magnet can sort of influence a plasma

305
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,959
and and make the plasma follow those

306
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,760
field lines. It's a very different

307
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,600
configuration. Um, that is a rare earth

308
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,360
magnet that's on the left. It's a dipole

309
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,959
magnet. So, the field is kind of coming

310
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,680
out of the top and going around to the

311
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,600
bottom there. And then the U plasma is

312
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,000
just like an basically an arc of plasma

313
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,600
between two electrodes. So we'll watch

314
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,360
this video. As our plasma moves over the

315
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,160
magnet, it goes from being basically

316
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,320
linear to sort of encompassing the

317
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,399
entire magnet, right? The plasma is

318
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,720
moving through the magnetic field and it

319
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,639
tries to move from the top of the magnet

320
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,720
down to the bottom of the magnet. So

321
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,639
that's sort of another type of of

322
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,240
magnetic confinement. It's not the same

323
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,480
geometry, but I think it's a nice

324
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,480
demonstration. Also, don't try that at

325
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,720
home unless you have high voltage

326
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,399
training and all those supplies.

327
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,079
So, here at MIT, we have a lot of

328
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,480
experience with magnetic confinement

329
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,200
fusion over many decades. Uh, but I just

330
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,079
want to highlight uh one sort of uh

331
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,000
exciting result that we had back in 2016

332
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,760
while I was a graduate student here. So,

333
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,680
this is again the Alcatore Seamont

334
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,360
tokamac. We're showing a picture of the

335
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,839
inside again in the upper right hand

336
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,839
corner. Now this device um was

337
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,839
relatively small about 2 meters in

338
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,839
diameter. So you know six feet or so on

339
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,839
the inside. Uh the magnetic field

340
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,320
strength this is really what's important

341
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,639
to help confine our plasma. We could

342
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,120
vary that from 2 to 8 Tesla. And your

343
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,880
MRI machine is around 1 to two Tesla. So

344
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,600
this is significantly stronger than what

345
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,399
most humans would ever experience. Now

346
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,959
the Q value this power out over in was

347
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,320
very very small in CMOD. Um, and that's

348
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,920
just because we didn't we weren't using

349
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,160
the right type of fuel in the first

350
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,800
place. And so it wasn't really one of

351
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,519
the main goals of the machine. However,

352
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,920
we were able to achieve a new record

353
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,440
which was the highest stored plasma

354
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,519
pressure. Basically, the magnetic

355
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,680
pressure fighting against the the heat

356
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,680
and the pressure inside our plasma. And

357
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,959
so on the left you can see this is the

358
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,639
day. A lot of people in the room

359
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,800
probably recognize people in the photo.

360
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,240
I put a little arrow to where I was

361
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,320
standing on that day. It was all very

362
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,839
exciting. And here is a video of that

363
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,760
discharge. So, we're looking inside. You

364
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,639
can see the inner wall kind of matching

365
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,120
the the photo above there. The plasma is

366
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,120
very bright. It lasts for only about a

367
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,440
second, but that's when we achieved the

368
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,600
highest plasma pressure record. Um,

369
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,079
maybe I can play that again for folks.

370
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,160
I'll just say that this is not what it

371
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,000
really looks like. This is a false color

372
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,680
video. And the brightest parts of the

373
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,839
plasma are actually the coldest parts of

374
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,240
the plasma where it's emitting visible

375
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,199
radiation which the camera can see. Um,

376
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,639
if we had a an X-ray camera, video

377
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,480
camera, then we would be able to see

378
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,760
sort of the the shape of the plasma, the

379
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,199
real doughnut

380
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,360
shaped. So, I was very lucky to have

381
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,240
been here for that record and the and

382
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,320
the end of CMOD's lifetime. Um, then I

383
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,760
moved over to the jet tokamac which at

384
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,800
the time was the largest operating

385
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,120
tokamac in the world. Um, and I was very

386
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,000
fortunate to also be there for their own

387
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,079
record for highest uh, fusion energy

388
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,240
achieved. So on the right we're seeing

389
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,639
again inside the jet tokamac. It's quite

390
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,399
a bit bigger than CMOD. So uh, from the

391
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,320
center out to the edge it's about 4

392
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,800
meters. So it's kind of four times

393
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,800
bigger than the CMO tokamac but the

394
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,480
magnetic field is smaller around three

395
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,120
Tesla. So, uh, this machine, uh, one of

396
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,519
its sort of general goals was to try to,

397
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,120
you know, get close to this Q of one.

398
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,839
Um, but it didn't quite get there. It

399
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,839
got to around Q of point4, which is not

400
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,720
bad, but we're not actually, you know,

401
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,440
breaking that break even barrier. Um,

402
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,519
still they achieved a nice record of 69

403
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,600
mega in terms of uh a a total energy um,

404
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,199
fusion energy emitted by the plasma. And

405
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,440
for reference of 4 mega is 1 kg of TNT.

406
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,680
So, it's about 10 kilos of TNT of

407
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,519
energy, which is pretty impressive. So,

408
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,360
let's go ahead and watch this video

409
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,519
here. We're going to see the left half

410
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,440
of the tokamac now, sort of mirroring

411
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,519
what's on the right. You can see the

412
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,600
visible emission down in the bottom of

413
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,600
the machine. And as the plasma goes,

414
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,279
here's the high power phase where we see

415
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,079
a lot of light. And you can see sort of

416
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,959
the entire machine lighting up. Again,

417
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,639
this is a visible um emission, so we're

418
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,160
not seeing the the X-ray emission from

419
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,160
the center of the plasma.

420
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,839
Um around that same time uh MIT was

421
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,839
exploring these high temperature

422
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,519
superconducting magnets. So high

423
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,160
temperature superconductors shown up in

424
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,000
the the top right corner there. Um these

425
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,759
are very thin tapes and when you get

426
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,720
them cold enough they can basically

427
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,959
carry current forever. So the team here

428
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,680
at MIT uh in collaboration with a

429
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,360
private company Fusion Systems built

430
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,759
this magnet which you can see in the

431
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,360
picture. It's quite a large magnet, you

432
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,519
know, about there are some people for

433
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,480
reference there. Um, and they wound this

434
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,720
out of the high temperature

435
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,560
superconducting tape and they achieved a

436
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,720
magnetic fields on the coil that was

437
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,560
greater than 20 Tesla. So remember, we

438
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,880
went from, you know, jet was three

439
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,880
Tesla, CMOD could go up to eight Tesla

440
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,959
and now we're getting up to 20 Tesla,

441
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,120
you know, over 10 times or even 20 times

442
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,399
the MRI magnetic field strength that

443
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,959
most people experience. And now this uh

444
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,439
achievement here basically unlocked the

445
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,079
funding to pursue building the spark

446
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,640
tokamac which is mostly what I work on

447
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,000
now. Um and this is there's this private

448
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,079
company fusion systems that spun out of

449
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,559
MIT. So here's kind of the current state

450
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,319
status of that device. Um there's a big

451
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,160
site up in Devons, Massachusetts. You

452
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,240
can see an aerial view here of the site.

453
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,679
In the in the background is the magnet

454
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,360
factory where they're building more of

455
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,600
the magnets like you saw on the previous

456
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,160
slide. And then in the foreground, this

457
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,160
is where the tokamac will live. So this

458
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,640
uh magenta arrows pointing to the

459
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,360
tokamac hall and inside you can see

460
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,200
inside in this upper right hand plot um

461
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,679
is where the tok will sit. Now a sort of

462
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,840
poster of what the tok will look like is

463
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,600
up on the far wall there, but it will

464
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,600
sit in the in the center of the floor.

465
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,440
And in the uh bottom right hand corner

466
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,120
is sort of a CAD rendering of what the

467
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,520
device will look like with a person per

468
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,120
for reference. So the magnetic field in

469
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,000
the center of the plasma is around 12

470
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Tesla. So 50% higher than CMOD was able

471
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,200
to achieve. The diameter is about five

472
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,600
meters. So it's somewhere in between the

473
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,480
size that we built here at MIT and then

474
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,720
the size of the jet tok in the UK. And

475
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,640
the goal is to achieve Q greater than

476
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,559
one to demonstrate for the first time in

477
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,720
magnetic confinement fusion that we can

478
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,440
get more power out from fusion than we

479
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,960
put in to heat the plasma. Now, that

480
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,120
picture in the top right is a little out

481
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,799
of date. Here is a more recent picture

482
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,120
where they've actually in just installed

483
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,280
the Kryostat base, uh, which is where

484
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,280
the tokamac will sit. And they're busy

485
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,039
building the magnets for this tok. And

486
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,120
the vacuum vessel is also about to

487
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,200
arrive and we'll hopefully see our first

488
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,120
plasma sometime in

489
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,280
2026. Lastly, I just want to touch on uh

490
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,280
some challenges for for Tokamax. There

491
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,919
are way more than I could put on a

492
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,280
slide. Could be a whole other talk. Um

493
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,160
but I would say the trajectory for

494
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,240
tokamax is looking very good. Uh but we

495
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,919
have some things we need to address. One

496
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,240
is there are inherent plasma

497
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,480
instabilities in tokamax that can lead

498
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,039
to disruptions of your plasma and also

499
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,200
lead to relativistic electrons. This is

500
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,280
something I studied for my PhD. So

501
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,440
here's a video uh and you're going to

502
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,200
see the kind of a normal looking plasma

503
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,280
but runaway electrons are going to hit

504
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,440
that that metal thing on the right and

505
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,440
you'll see a shower of molten metal at

506
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,120
the end of the video. Okay, hopefully

507
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,200
you saw that. I'll play it one more

508
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,799
time. Um, this is something we

509
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,840
definitely want to avoid in future

510
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,360
tokamax because it can melt uh the the

511
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,720
metal that we have and you can see a

512
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,799
picture um of melting in jet um that

513
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,960
occurred. Also, there are a lot of

514
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,200
materials challenges related to melting

515
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,039
also you know getting power out of the

516
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,360
machine. We don't exactly know how

517
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,600
that's going to work yet. The sort of

518
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,520
plan that was developed at MIT also

519
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,240
being carried forward by CFS is to use

520
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,160
this molten salt fly which is shown here

521
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,400
in the the molten form on the right and

522
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,400
when it's its solid uh form on the left

523
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,360
there. Uh so there's a project going on

524
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,080
here Libra which is going to test how

525
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,880
this uh molten salt is able to breed

526
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,320
some of the fuel needed for fusion. Um

527
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,640
and um this is the plan for the future

528
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,880
uh fusion devices that CFS is going to

529
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,480
to build as well. So I hope I gave I've

530
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,720
given you a pretty good overview of

531
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,320
magnetic fusion. Now I'm going to turn

532
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:28,039
it over to Maria. Let's talk about laser

533
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,600
[Applause]

534
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:33,919
fusion. Um okay

535
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,520
so laser fusion uh works a little bit

536
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,120
differently than magnetic and fine

537
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,280
fusion. Although we obviously have the

538
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,919
same goal. Uh Alex showed the fusion

539
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,159
reaction at the

540
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,400
start alpha and that's still what we're

541
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,159
using in laser fusion as well. Uh but

542
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,559
the way that we do it in inertia

543
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,720
confinement fusion, we rely on the

544
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,679
inertia of the fuel to keep it together

545
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,520
long enough to burn. Uh so this is a

546
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,200
very simple illustration of how it

547
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,440
works. We'll get back to some examples

548
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,039
of how this is actually done. Uh but

549
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,360
basically you have a laser or X-rays

550
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:09,640
irradiating the surface of a a spherical

551
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,320
castle eating the surface

552
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,000
and when you do that when you irdiate

553
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,600
the surface with either the laser

554
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,679
directly or with X-rays as we'll get

555
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,280
back to uh you get ablation of the

556
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,120
surface material so you have a bunch of

557
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,360
material that starts moving off that

558
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,960
surface and then just from momentum and

559
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,679
energy conservation the rest of the

560
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,440
materials can start moving inwards the

561
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,159
kinetic energy of the shell that's

562
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,799
moving inwards and that kinetic energy

563
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,360
um is transformed into heat. So you get

564
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,799
a um heating of the fuel and you get

565
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,679
compression. So you get much higher

566
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,240
density and higher temperature brings us

567
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,919
down here. And once we get hot enough

568
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,640
and dense enough, that's when we get the

569
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,559
fusion reactions going. And the idea is

570
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,720
that the alpha particle is going to stay

571
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,360
in this fuel. So once you start getting

572
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,200
enough alpha particles generated in the

573
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,880
fusion reactions, you're going to get a

574
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,559
burn wave going. you can burn a

575
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,200
significant amount of this assembled

576
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,440
fuel. Um, and same as Alex said, the

577
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,799
neutron will escape for energy

578
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,159
production. The idea is to use the

579
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,480
neutron um to boil water essentially in

580
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,320
a reactor. Now, we're using the neutron

581
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,919
as a diagnostic indicator so we can

582
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,000
figure out what's going on in these

583
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,360
explosions. Uh, we talked about bank

584
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,960
time uh in in our circusion or ICF and

585
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,720
that's the time of peak nuclear

586
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,760
production. So to give you a sense of

587
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,640
the time scale basically this whole um

588
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,240
the laser poles the ablation the

589
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,120
compression and the convergence all

590
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,360
happens over about 10 nanocond for a

591
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,159
full scale implosion and then the actual

592
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,400
burn duration is order 50 picosconds. So

593
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,120
it's it's really a very very fast

594
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,640
experiment that we're talking about. Um

595
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,520
and just to give you a sense of the

596
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,520
scale uh the level of compression that

597
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,280
you have to do for these the capsule

598
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,000
starts out at about two millimeters in

599
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,760
diameter. So this is the scale model but

600
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,600
basically the equivalent is if you took

601
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,240
a basketball and squeeze it down to the

602
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,840
size of a green pee which also gives you

603
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,520
a sense of the challenge involved.

604
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,080
Imagine if you take a balloon and try to

605
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,240
squeeze it on all

606
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,320
sides. That level of squeezing without

607
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,080
the balloon bursting out through your

608
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,080
fingers. So it it's not an easy

609
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:22,640
one. Um there are three primary

610
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,320
approaches to doing this and two of them

611
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,240
use laser. So it's a little bit of a

612
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,919
misnomer to call this laser fusion but

613
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,120
we often do anyway because it's simpler

614
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,600
for people to understand than

615
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,520
inertifying fusion. But we have direct

616
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,280
drive which is where the laser beams

617
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,120
directly hit the DT fil capsule. And

618
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,960
then again just to give you a sense of

619
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,159
the scale, it's a 2 millimeter diameter

620
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,720
capsule like that. Um we also have

621
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,799
indirect in here. This is what I alluded

622
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,720
to on the previous slide. We have a

623
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,679
cylindrical cavity which we call a

624
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,400
whole. Um it's a German word that

625
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,799
basically means cylindrical cavity. Um

626
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,880
and the laces are incident on the walls

627
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,640
of that whole and converted to X-rays.

628
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,360
And it's actually the X-rays that drive

629
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,799
the capsule. And I have a example of a

630
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,720
whole here. So, I'm going to pass this

631
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,640
around and let you guys look at it. Uh,

632
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,159
this is an actual NIFA, but it's from

633
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,159
many years ago. So, it's not the same

634
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,760
scale that's used these days. But if you

635
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,919
turn this on its side, you can also see

636
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,559
that little fuel pellet in the center of

637
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,320
the So, look at it like this first. See

638
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:26,159
the cylindrical can and then turn it on

639
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,159
the side to actually see the fuel

640
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,240
capsule. Okay. So, that's the indirect

641
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,559
drive. We have the cylinder that we use

642
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,640
for that. And then finally we have

643
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,960
magnetic drive which is done at the Z

644
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,919
machine. Uh so here we drive a current

645
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,360
plasma uh to get the confinement and

646
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,240
I'll explain it in a little bit more

647
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,039
detail on a later slide. Um so all

648
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,200
current ICF facilities are research

649
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,880
facilities not aimed at generating

650
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,360
energy. We'll come back at that to that

651
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,600
a little bit later as well. And that in

652
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,520
the US we do have one flagship facility

653
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,919
that's pursuing each of these three

654
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,000
approaches.

655
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,480
So let me talk you through those. We

656
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,480
have the Omega laser facility at the

657
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,640
University of Rochester in upstate New

658
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,520
York. And this facility is optimized to

659
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,960
use a direct drive

660
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,520
approach. This is a a picture of the

661
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,799
full facility or obviously not a picture

662
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,799
schematic. Uh and what's actually taking

663
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,279
up most of the space here is the laser

664
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:28,240
bay. So this whole part is the laser

665
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,200
bay. uh and we have 60 laser beams at

666
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,840
omega which ultimately reach the target

667
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,760
chamber over here which is ball-shaped.

668
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,679
Uh this is the picture of the target

669
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,720
chamber. You can almost not even see the

670
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,880
ball because of all these white boxes.

671
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,640
These white boxes are where the lasers

672
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,559
enter into the target chamber. So again

673
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,039
there are 60 of them and they're

674
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,720
distributed uniformly around the chamber

675
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,480
optimized for direct drive. We really

676
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,799
want to hit all sides of that capsule

677
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,080
uniformly for the

678
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:57,679
lasers. This target chamber is three

679
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,600
meters in diameter just to give you a

680
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:03,679
sense of scale. And actually when you

681
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,400
look inside the chamber is not empty. Uh

682
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,080
you have a lot of diagnostics entering

683
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,600
into the chamber during the experiment

684
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,000
to actually be able to figure out what's

685
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,320
going on in these really uh short time

686
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,480
scale these really hot plasmas. So

687
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,919
again, Omega has 60 laser beams and it's

688
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,000
capable of delivering 30 kg total to the

689
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,840
target, which when we look at the N at

690
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,600
the next slide, you'll see that 30 kg is

691
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,240
a really small amount of energy. So this

692
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,000
is really a subscale facility. Um, but

693
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,799
experiments at Omega have been really

694
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,400
successful over the last few years. Um

695
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,080
and what we can look at the way we can

696
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,480
look at that is okay we only have 30

697
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,799
kilogjles of energy available but if the

698
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,279
laser energy was scaled up to two megles

699
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,600
which is what the NF can deliver then

700
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,840
will direct implosions ignite and this

701
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,559
is actually from a recent nature physics

702
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,559
paper um demonstration of a

703
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,520
hydronamically equivalent burning plasma

704
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:58,080
in direct drive fusion. So we can show

705
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,400
the extrapolated fusion yield with melee

706
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,559
from these omega implosions if you scale

707
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,279
it from the 30 kilogjles in to the two

708
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,720
mega in you reach the burning plasma

709
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,320
regime but you're not quite in the

710
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,159
ignition machine yet. So these are

711
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,400
bigger results from Omega but they're

712
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,320
not quite on the level of indirect drive

713
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,000
even if they were at a full scale

714
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,919
facility. And with that let's uh take a

715
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,320
look at the Z machine. So magnetic drive

716
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,400
ICF is being pursued at the Z pulse

717
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,640
power facility at Sandia National Labs

718
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,679
in New Mexico. And the idea here is that

719
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,440
in magnetic drive ICF an actual current

720
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,919
creates a JRO speed B force that's used

721
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,960
to implode a gas field pre-magnetized

722
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:41,360
target. So we call this mag um

723
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,760
magnetized liner in fusion. You start

724
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,520
with the pre-magnetization and also a

725
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,559
little bit of of preheating using a

726
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,240
laser. Uh and then you drive the um

727
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,480
current through to get the J press B

728
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,399
force and the compression. Uh and this

729
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,080
is done in the machine like this. So the

730
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,720
target is about a centimeter tall

731
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,120
cylinder which sits right here and the

732
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,520
current is coming through here. Um and

733
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,120
this a discharge can look like this. Um

734
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,559
this is actually a fail discharge. It

735
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,240
doesn't normally look like this but it

736
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,799
makes for a pretty picture. Um the goal

737
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,200
of this imaging is to demonstrate 100 kJ

738
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,840
DT equivalent fusion yield. Uh this

739
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,520
imaging runs with pure dutarium as the

740
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,480
fuel but they've started experimenting

741
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:26,799
with adding some some trace tridium. Uh

742
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:31,039
it's 33 m in diameter uh 26 mega current

743
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:32,640
and 22 mega stored energy. Uh, and I'm

744
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,559
not I'm not going to talk more about

745
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,880
this today, but just to mention our

746
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,799
group here at MIT is working on we have

747
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,480
one diagnostic installed on the Z

748
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,320
machine, which is a compact recoil

749
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,559
spectrometer to look at the neutrons

750
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,399
from the DD reactions and we're working

751
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,440
on developing a magnetic recoil

752
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,600
spectrometer for the Z machine as

753
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,960
well. Okay. And then uh the big one

754
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,320
indirect drive lace diffusion

755
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,720
experiments are being done at the

756
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,039
national ignition facility which I keep

757
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,200
referring to as N in Livermore in

758
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,000
California. And here you can easily see

759
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,320
the comparison to Omega. Uh this is

760
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,559
actually the scale comparison. So very

761
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,200
similar footprint of the facil or sorry

762
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,120
very similar layout of the facilities

763
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,880
but the foot is very different. This is

764
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,720
the direct scale comparison.

765
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,559
Um, at the N facility again we have the

766
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,240
laser bay taking up most of the space

767
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,159
and people typically talk about that

768
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,840
it's the size of three football fields

769
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,039
which for me as a suite doesn't mean a

770
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,039
whole lot but

771
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,960
um and then we have the target chamber

772
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,520
over here which is now 10 mters in

773
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,120
diameter so significantly bigger and if

774
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,880
you look at this you can kind of see

775
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,200
that all the lasers coming in from the

776
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,840
top and bottom instead uniformly from

777
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,000
all sides. uh that's seen easier in this

778
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,760
picture which is the side view of the

779
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
target chamber. This blue ball is the

780
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,240
target chamber and obviously the reason

781
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,919
for this is that N is optimized for

782
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,440
indirect drive. So you have that that

783
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,200
cylinder you're trying to get the laser

784
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,159
beams into the bottom. Um this is what

785
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,640
it can look like. It's obviously just a

786
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:06,640
artist's impression. uh but you have the

787
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,640
cylindrical ho round laser beams are

788
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,919
incidentated in rings and converted to

789
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,679
x-rays and then you can drive the

790
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,960
capsules and we already passed around

791
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,039
the picture of the actual model of so n

792
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,080
delivers about 2 megaj of laser energy

793
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,320
to a centimeter

794
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,880
scaled and it's got 192 laser beams

795
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,960
compared omega

796
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,919
60 okay I have let's see I don't think

797
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,720
we can do sound here right it's it's

798
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,760
just imagine this

799
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:38,240
very eerie very um interesting sound.

800
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,159
Let me see if we can put it. This is a N

801
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,679
beamline movie just to give you an idea

802
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:46,399
of how it actually

803
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:48,480
works. Okay. And it um first he calls

804
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,039
out shot director ready for shot and

805
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:56,120
then they um they show the seed

806
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:59,600
poles. Okay. It's a little jumping

807
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,960
today. So yeah, imagine this really um

808
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,720
adventure movie kind of music.

809
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,240
Okay, we have a seed pulse which is

810
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,679
really small originally. It's

811
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,039
pre-amplified. Um here comes the seed

812
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,200
pulse

813
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:17,520
there master oscillator and then it's

814
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,840
going to get split and amplified in two

815
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,159
stages. A pre-amplification stage and

816
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,320
then a main amplification stage after

817
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,960
it's split into all the 192 beams where

818
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,240
it bounces back and forth four times

819
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,320
until it gets to its final energy.

820
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,279
There are parts

821
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,880
bouncing and then eventually we're

822
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,679
actually need to follow these laser

823
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:44,799
beams into the target chamber

824
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,480
bouncing. It's um yeah, it's more fun

825
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,480
with the music, but it's also very

826
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,480
irritating.

827
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,519
Okay, so now we're moving with the laser

828
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,559
beams in from the laser bay into the

829
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,559
target bay. This is the wall towards the

830
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,679
target bay.

831
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:06,000
Yes. So now you can see the

832
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:08,600
target and again it's 192 beams. They're

833
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,960
all coming in on their individual beam

834
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:16,799
lines. Uh

835
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:19,919
and you can see frequency from 1053

836
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,200
nmters to 351. And that's pretty color

837
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,799
change. And this 351 nmter wavelength

838
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,039
laser beams all hit a

839
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:33,679
horiz. And you can see in the walls of

840
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,679
the hormone and we'll soon get the X-ray

841
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:42,000
conversion. There we go. Here are the

842
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,399
X-rays and the abilation of the surface

843
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,120
material. Rest of material starts moving

844
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:50,919
inwards and we get okay. So that's how

845
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,120
an experiment did

846
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:54,960
work. I think you can look it up on

847
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,960
YouTube if you want with the music too

848
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,960
like

849
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,679
Uh just a couple of uh fun pictures from

850
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,159
the N. So this one is from the

851
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:12,480
inauguration. Uh and this one is from uh

852
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,399
one of the Star Trek movies. So this is

853
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,799
actually a gamma reaction history

854
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,519
diagnostic uh which somehow turned into

855
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,200
the warp core in the movie. uh my

856
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,960
colleague Hans Herman at Los Alamos was

857
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,279
nationalist the brain behind this

858
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,880
diagnostic and he took his kids to the

859
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,760
movies to see this movie was very proud

860
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,760
to be able to point out his

861
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,799
um okay so you may have all heard or

862
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,919
most of you may have heard that on

863
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,240
December 5th 2022 fusion ignition energy

864
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,320
gain were demonstrated in the laboratory

865
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,399
for the first time uh and this really

866
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,960
was a moment 60 plus years in the

867
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:54,080
meeting so what happened on this shot

868
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:56,720
with 3.15 megajoules per output and 3.05

869
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:00,480
megajles laser input. So that's a target

870
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,880
gain of 1.5 and there's a whole gallery

871
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,919
of videos about this result uh if you go

872
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,280
to the uh

873
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:11,679
lasers.lm.gov web page uh and give you a

874
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,679
little bit of background to that. So

875
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,159
getting to ignition and energy took more

876
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,000
than a decade of meticulous research at

877
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,399
the NIF and there were many many

878
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,079
challenges along the way. This is uh

879
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:27,919
kind of illustrating progress in target

880
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:31,760
gain. So from the first experiments in

881
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,960
uh 2011 with DT and working up towards

882
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,919
this result in December 2022 uh we went

883
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,040
from a target gain of 10 to the minus 3

884
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,960
if you 10 to the minus 4 uh and worked

885
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,919
our way through many many different

886
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:50,159
permutations until we finally achieved

887
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,839
um target gain on December 4th 2022. So

888
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,200
some of the changes just to give you an

889
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,560
idea I'm not going to go through this in

890
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,000
detail. We started with a plastic

891
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:02,960
ablator and tried to do really long

892
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,040
laser poles to drive it um to really uh

893
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,800
drive it like really high compression

894
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,400
and it turns out you have a lot of

895
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,480
instabilities you have to worry about

896
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,720
when you do that. So basically all these

897
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,560
implosions were killed by mix. So the

898
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,560
first thing that happened was we figured

899
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,040
out how to mitigate some of that high Z

900
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,920
mix links with a shorter laser pulse

901
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,240
which led to this jump in target gain to

902
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,480
10 to the

903
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,720
minus2. Uh and then um started looking

904
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,960
at using different surface material of

905
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,880
the capsule from these plastic abladers.

906
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,960
We went to high density carbon which is

907
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,880
just another word for diamond basically

908
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,920
switching to mostly diamond the bladers

909
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,920
starting in 2016. uh and then figured

910
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,839
out ways to increase the coupling

911
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,560
efficiency of the lasers using larger

912
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:48,640
capsules, changing this uh shape of the

913
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,880
or the dimensions of the capsule

914
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,040
relative to the whole arm, changing how

915
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,680
long you let the laser poles drive the

916
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,119
capsule uh versus just letting it coast

917
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:02,320
at the end. Uh as well as learning how

918
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,920
to do cleaner targets. Um and just to

919
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,520
this I'm going to play a little video

920
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,599
unfortunately in um Google slides. It's

921
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,560
hiding this text, but this is from a 3D

922
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,320
hydra simulation. Uh, and we got

923
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,640
temperature on the left hand side and

924
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,720
density on the right hand side. Uh, and

925
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,680
below is just saying who did it is a

926
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,760
simulation by Dan Clark at Lawrence

927
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,640
Livermore. Uh,

928
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:28,800
and this is just so this is the capsule

929
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,280
only simulation and this is one that

930
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,119
probably is somewhere in this range. Uh

931
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,560
where you could see I'm gonna play it a

932
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,160
couple times, but you could see already

933
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,720
at the start print uh both at the top

934
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,400
and bottom and the little divot coming

935
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,599
in from the right. So if you see that

936
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,160
again um those are actually engineering

937
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,280
features on the target. So the way you

938
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,960
hold that capsule inside the whole

939
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,440
really thin membrane which we call a

940
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,520
tent. It doesn't just levitate. It has

941
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,560
to be held in place somehow. And that's

942
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,760
what's uh giving rise to these really

943
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,839
bad ruptures at the top and bottom. So

944
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,000
learning how to mitigate that by shaping

945
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,000
the laser pools better using thinner

946
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,240
tents was one big thing. The other thing

947
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,160
is where the fuel gets inserted into the

948
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,400
capsule. That's the fill tube right

949
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,079
here. That became a really bad problem

950
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,880
too in terms of engineering. That would

951
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,280
rupture uh the compression and not allow

952
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,119
us to do uniformly. So we actually went

953
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,920
from I think originally we were working

954
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,079
with something like 20 micron fill tubes

955
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,079
and the igniting implosion is now a two

956
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,240
micron fill tube. So that's thinner than

957
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,640
a human hair that's used to inject the

958
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,119
fuel into the capsule which is kind of

959
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,640
crazy. So we don't think the implosions

960
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,000
look like this anymore but these were

961
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,079
definitely some of the issues that we

962
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,400
had to work through uh to get to where

963
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,400
we're at

964
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,560
today. Thank you. Okay. So, but once

965
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,720
things started taking off, rapid

966
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,880
progress was made. So, the first thing

967
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,680
that happened was in the winter of 2021

968
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,599
where we started having burning plasmas.

969
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,599
Uh, and this was published in nature in

970
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,839
January 2022. There's a picture of the

971
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,760
cover right there. Uh, and what that

972
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,599
means is really that the alpha particle

973
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,760
started doing its job. So, uh, this is

974
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,640
the article from nature, burning plasma

975
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,560
achieved in inertial fusion. And um I'm

976
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,200
quoting Livermore's Alex Sster here.

977
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,440
Alex was also previously of MIT. He uh

978
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,640
he got his PhD from the plasma science

979
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,720
fusion center and he was the a respons

980
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,720
responsible individual for some of these

981
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,560
shots in this campaign. And what he said

982
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,400
was experiments over decades have

983
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,400
produced fusion reactions using large

984
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,880
amounts of external heating to get the

985
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,720
plasma hot. But now for the first time

986
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,359
we have a system where the fusion itself

987
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,000
is providing most of the heating. So

988
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,920
really in this paper it explicitly says

989
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,599
a burning plasma state signifies a

990
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,760
transformational change to the energy

991
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,000
and power balance in the DT plasma

992
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,880
opening up the potential for rapidly

993
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,960
increasing performance and rapidly

994
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,680
increas increasing performance is what

995
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,760
we got. The next thing that happened was

996
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,960
in August 2021

997
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,839
um this is what we as ICF scientists

998
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,079
call ignition. So we got 1.3 megajoules

999
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,160
out for 1.9 megajoules in. It's not

1000
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,680
target gain. But this is the first time

1001
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,320
we really saw that thermonuclear

1002
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,320
instability taken off where it got much

1003
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,400
hotter. The burn duration got much

1004
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,160
shorter and we started seeing that the

1005
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,079
burning plasma was actually bigger

1006
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,640
meaning that it's burning on its way out

1007
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,160
as it's exploding. So this is what we

1008
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,760
call ignition. Uh but it didn't meet the

1009
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,400
I think it was the national academy of

1010
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,720
sciences that had said ignition is when

1011
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,280
uh the output exceeds the laser energy

1012
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,760
in. So for a long time we're not allowed

1013
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,839
to call this ignition but for us this

1014
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,119
was really still really the the biggest

1015
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:54,079
news. Uh and there were around 470 news

1016
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,560
reports in August 2021 alone. And uh

1017
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,359
Alex Silstster again shared the um

1018
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,880
spreadsheet with me so I can show you

1019
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:05,040
exactly. Okay. So after this pretty soon

1020
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,040
is where we had this target gain larger

1021
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,800
than one shot. Uh and this is one of

1022
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,320
those moments on a personal note. This

1023
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,760
is one of those moments in time you

1024
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,960
really know what you were doing. So this

1025
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:17,320
is is me um during a Swedish Christmas

1026
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,119
concert in between rounds of MRS

1027
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:23,200
analysis. Um so MRS I mean I did I think

1028
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,960
briefly mentioned it on my bio but this

1029
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,880
is that's the detector that we have

1030
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,520
installed at the N that measures the

1031
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,160
neutron spectra. Um so this is me and

1032
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,920
Chris with that spectrometer.

1033
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,440
And I think I should shouldn't take too

1034
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,000
much time there, but just to give you an

1035
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,079
idea, the neutrons uh are produced at

1036
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,480
the target chamber center. A fraction of

1037
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,480
them will scatter in a um duterrated

1038
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,280
plastic conversion foil and forward

1039
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,960
scattered recoil dutans will go on to

1040
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,119
take a different trajectory through this

1041
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,720
magnet depending on their energy. They

1042
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,040
end up in a different physical location

1043
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,760
on the array. So based on where you find

1044
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,440
duturans on these plastic detectors

1045
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,359
which are processed after the shot in

1046
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,040
the dedicated etchin scan lab, you can

1047
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,200
figure out how many nutrients were born

1048
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,839
here, how hot the plasma was, and how

1049
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,079
tightly it was compressed. So it's

1050
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,599
pretty neat. So anyway, I was analyzing

1051
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,839
that data. I was um camping with scouts

1052
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,520
that weekend. I got the first scans in

1053
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,960
the morning, found an office at the camp

1054
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,560
where I could do the analysis and went

1055
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,119
and did the Christmas concert and got

1056
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,839
the next round of of scans and was able

1057
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,960
to confirm the results. So yes, we got

1058
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:31,359
target gain and that was a lot of fun.

1059
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,160
Since then, uh we've managed to repeat

1060
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,000
it seven more times. Uh so there are now

1061
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,960
eight of these target gain larger than

1062
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,680
one shots on the timeline and the most

1063
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,160
recent one was in April, April 6th where

1064
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,680
we got 8.6 modules. So you will see that

1065
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,800
in absolute numbers this is less than

1066
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:52,400
what Alex was getting at the jet. Uh but

1067
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,400
this is a target gain of

1068
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,520
4.1. Um okay so to put this in

1069
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,200
perspective it is a research facility.

1070
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,839
So we're really not anywhere close to

1071
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,240
putting energy on the grid. There's a

1072
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:08,800
lot of losses in the system. Uh and we

1073
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,760
worked our way through first we showed

1074
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,520
scientific break break even in 2014. we

1075
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,000
were able to show more energy output and

1076
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,760
it was coupled to the fuel. Uh burning

1077
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,079
plasma was more energy out than was

1078
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,920
coupled to the capsule. Uh then

1079
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,359
ignition, we actually had more energy

1080
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,839
out uh uh than the X-rays were

1081
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:30,640
delivering. And then target gain is when

1082
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,079
we had more energy out than the laser

1083
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,160
delivered to the target. And that's

1084
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,760
where we're at right now. So, but in

1085
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,920
order for the laser to be able to

1086
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,599
deliver this much energy to the capsule,

1087
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,760
the capacitors are using 400 m. So it's

1088
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,839
definitely not facility gain yet and

1089
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,680
that's what people in private companies

1090
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:51,520
are starting to work towards now. N is

1091
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,520
never going to reach facility gain. N is

1092
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,200
aiming for ever higher performance with

1093
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,280
the near-term goal of 10 megajoules

1094
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,280
which we said 8.6. So it's really not

1095
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,440
too far away right now and they also

1096
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,599
have an enhanced yield capability which

1097
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,520
is pushing up towards 30 or 60

1098
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,760
megajoules. It's never going to get to

1099
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,839
400 megles. So what's needed there

1100
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,680
architecture changes many different

1101
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,400
things.

1102
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,160
uh and the other thing uh is we need to

1103
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,160
repeat this often. So there are many

1104
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,400
steps remaining to make inertial fusion

1105
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,480
a reality and this is kind this is from

1106
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,119
a a report that I think is about to come

1107
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,800
out from measurement innovations basic

1108
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,480
research needs workshop just to give you

1109
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:33,040
a sense we have shot rate hertz on the

1110
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,160
x- axis and the performance in terms of

1111
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,480
gain on the y- axis and it's just

1112
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,720
illustrating so n at at the time I made

1113
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,520
this plot just over a year ago was at a

1114
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:48,960
gain of slight two uh and omega is at

1115
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,880
you know, well less than one gain uh but

1116
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,079
can repeat more often at 12 shots per

1117
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,240
day there. Um then we also have a large

1118
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,920
number of smaller lasers around the US

1119
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,079
that are actually already capable of

1120
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,119
operating at rep rate but don't have any

1121
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,880
gain at all. They're not intended to do

1122
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:08,000
implosions. So what where we need to get

1123
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,880
in order to have an inertial fusion

1124
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,079
energy plant is up here where we have a

1125
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,319
gain of about 100 and a rep rate of

1126
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,200
about 10 hertz. So there's quite a bit

1127
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,520
of research remaining to do. Uh one

1128
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,359
thing though the N is built on 90s

1129
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,440
architecture. So we think that we could

1130
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:29,359
already now get to uh um 10% laser

1131
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,200
efficiency compared to that 400 megles

1132
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,720
to two megales. That's that's really

1133
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,920
bad. That's not what we think we could

1134
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,160
do these days. Uh and there's been an

1135
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,640
explosion number of private companies

1136
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,359
working on this. We'll get back to it

1137
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:45,520
right at the end. Uh okay. Yeah, I don't

1138
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,200
think we really need to talk to this.

1139
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,040
The plant design will look similar to

1140
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,520
any other power plant. This is just for

1141
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:55,760
the the laser driver and the ICF type

1142
00:44:53,520 --> 00:45:01,079
chamber, but the rest of this part can

1143
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,079
be the same for vision as well.

1144
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,000
So, Alex, you want to come back up for

1145
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,000
this

1146
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:12,079
last win? We'll see. I I What's What's

1147
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,119
the next slide? That'll probably tell

1148
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,520
us. No, I mean, we

1149
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:20,319
uh do you want to talk? Yeah, sure. So

1150
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,480
you know you know it's clear that both

1151
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,480
hocamax and magnetic confinement fusion

1152
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,720
and and sort of lasers in terms of

1153
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,880
inertial com confinement fusion are are

1154
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,800
leading the path you know the leading

1155
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,480
candidates to to produce net fusion

1156
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,079
energy and electricity. I mean we've

1157
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,400
seen net fusion energy already with

1158
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,160
lasers. Uh this is a pretty common plot

1159
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,359
which most people have seen before

1160
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,640
plotting um various metrics but really

1161
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,560
what you want to know is you want to be

1162
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,480
in the upper right hand corner and I've

1163
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,720
highlighted here some of the experiments

1164
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,440
that Marie and I have worked on um which

1165
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,280
are already up there and hopefully as

1166
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,920
Spark comes online we'll we'll continue

1167
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:59,040
to push there and as these new companies

1168
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,760
build more facilities we'll get up into

1169
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,960
that right hand corner. Just to briefly

1170
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,800
say that um you saw how the sort of

1171
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,280
pathway for inertial confinement in

1172
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,599
terms of um their idea for a fusion

1173
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,400
power plant and Commonwealth Fusion

1174
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,480
Systems which spun out of MIT has taken

1175
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,000
on sort of the path that was developed

1176
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,560
here uh to go this compact high field

1177
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,440
route. Uh so after spark creating

1178
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,920
something that is is bigger um but

1179
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,480
similar size to the jet took Mac hoping

1180
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,839
to to create a power that's on the order

1181
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:34,839
of hundreds of megawatts of electricity

1182
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,000
and do you want to see oh yeah okay so

1183
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,599
the recent results um and both magnetic

1184
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
and inertia confinement fusion have

1185
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:46,480
generated a lot of excitement and also a

1186
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,640
jump in private fusion companies this

1187
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,720
slide specifically is about the ICF

1188
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:54,240
schemes so uh There was inertial fusion

1189
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,280
energy basic research needs workshop

1190
00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:00,240
that happened shortly after the ignition

1191
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:02,240
result and there's also been um a new

1192
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,920
initiative which we call if star

1193
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,079
inertial fusion energy science and

1194
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,400
technology accelerated research with

1195
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,640
three different hubs that form a kind of

1196
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,040
national consortium to push these

1197
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:17,359
efforts. uh MIT is part of the star fire

1198
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,359
hub which is led by uh Lawrence

1199
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:23,599
Livermore and then yeah this is uh I

1200
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,760
think our our final slide right? Yeah,

1201
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:27,520
this is just to say that you know uh

1202
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,319
there are a lot of private companies

1203
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:33,040
now. Uh I went to the fusion industry

1204
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,400
association which um has all of these

1205
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,240
members. So I just copied everything

1206
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,680
from their web page here. There probably

1207
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,640
more fusion companies that might not

1208
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:43,359
even be on here. Uh I put in these uh

1209
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:46,079
sort of magenta boxes uh companies that

1210
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:48,880
either MIT is working with or people

1211
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:51,280
from MIT have gone on to be founders or

1212
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,680
work closely in the uh early startup

1213
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,920
phases. So, it's really exciting to see

1214
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,000
um these companies spin out and and of

1215
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,760
course continue to work with MIT as well

1216
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,480
and and hopefully at least one of them

1217
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,560
will succeed. So, okay, the race of

1218
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:07,920
fusion energy, who will win? Well, we

1219
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:10,240
all win, right? Uh doesn't matter so

1220
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,319
much who who wins at the end of the day

1221
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,599
except you know their shareholders when

1222
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:19,440
they I but uh but you know this will be

1223
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:21,200
a huge uh success for humanity. Uh with

1224
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,520
that, we're happy to take some

1225
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,380
questions. Thank you for attending. Um

1226
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,699
and uh

1227
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,699
[Applause]

1228
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,040
yeah, if I can, I think it would be best

1229
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:38,000
to take some questions maybe from folks

1230
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,920
who are sort of new to Fusion. Um all

1231
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,400
the other PSFC folks, you know, we can

1232
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:49,640
obviously talk to most times. Uh so, uh

1233
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:49,640
anybody have a burning question?

1234
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:59,440
Yeah, first um which instabilities in

1235
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:02,640
magnetic confinement are currently kind

1236
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:06,800
of subjects of focus? I know about the

1237
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,680
uh catarash uh record last year about 22

1238
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,119
minutes. What feels like a long time,

1239
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,640
right? What time do we need to get to

1240
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,160
and what challenges do we have to get to

1241
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,520
that point? Yeah, that's a good

1242
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,920
question. So I think yeah you're

1243
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,319
referring to these uh really long

1244
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,400
plasmas like existing for for many

1245
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:24,559
minutes and and it's true that in the

1246
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,800
future we'll want to get to creating

1247
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,960
plasma pulses in magnetic confinement

1248
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,040
fusion that are on the order of say 20

1249
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,240
minutes or so. There there is some push

1250
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,400
to do fully steady state but in magnetic

1251
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,400
confinement fusion you have to drive

1252
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,640
well for tokamax you have to drive

1253
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,440
current in your plasma and so to

1254
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:45,119
continuously drive current in the plasma

1255
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,040
um well there are different techniques

1256
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,119
for doing that. If you can pulse your

1257
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,640
plasma so keep it on for 20 minutes and

1258
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,880
let it come back down which is what they

1259
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:56,240
were doing um in in France and also in

1260
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,920
in China um you know that might be a

1261
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,079
little more viable. Um but there are

1262
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,520
methods to do continuous current drive.

1263
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,000
It's some of that's being explored.

1264
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:06,880
People here at MIT work out in the D3D

1265
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:10,880
tokamac in San Diego and so um and it

1266
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:13,800
was also installed on CMOD. So um so

1267
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,720
there are a few ways to do this

1268
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,720
and not not super super long times but

1269
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,599
right uh 20 minutes still is a long time

1270
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,359
and then there are a lot of

1271
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,119
instabilities. Most of them arise

1272
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,280
because of the current that we actually

1273
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,800
have to put in to a tokamac. So, there

1274
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,880
are other types of magnetic fusion

1275
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,960
devices called stellarators. We didn't

1276
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,960
even touch here. You don't you're not

1277
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,640
supplying current to them. Um, and

1278
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,720
you're creating these really twisted

1279
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,480
magnetic field coils to create the

1280
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,960
magnetic geometry that you need to

1281
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,280
confine all your plasma. Um, and that is

1282
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,280
a way to have sort

1283
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,760
of steady state plasma that could kind

1284
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,839
of exist for as long as your other, you

1285
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,720
know, you know, heating or cooling

1286
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:54,240
parameters would need. Um, I hope that

1287
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:56,319
sort of answered your question. Yeah.

1288
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,000
Yeah. No, it answers it well. I might

1289
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:59,599
ask some more detailed questions later.

1290
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Sure. Yeah, maybe we see. Are there any

1291
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:05,040
other questions and we can come to you?

1292
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,920
There is one. So, you're talking about

1293
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:11,520
20 minutes for that for like an Aquator

1294
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,760
type of reactor. But yours, I can't even

1295
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,319
visualize in my head how that would go

1296
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,839
from this tiny little itty bitty thing

1297
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:18,960
into some sort of a mass production

1298
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:20,880
where you would actually producing

1299
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,559
energy. There have to be like billions

1300
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,319
of those things firing off all the time.

1301
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,800
Right. That's exactly right. Kind of

1302
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,800
hurts. It's

1303
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:34,240
I mean and there are experiments on yeah

1304
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:37,200
make well making simpler targets uh

1305
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:40,960
working on how to inject them. Uh so

1306
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,960
yeah those efforts have started

1307
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:45,200
guess that would be it's more like a

1308
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,040
almost like a car engine of like lots of

1309
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,280
explosions. So so some yeah so some of

1310
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,880
the other things actually uh get easier.

1311
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,480
you need less tridium than you would for

1312
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,720
a magnetic confinement facility. It's

1313
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,480
easier to protect the target chamber.

1314
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:58,240
But we definitely have to solve those

1315
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,960
problems. So yeah, so one of the things

1316
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,040
that people are working on is um wedded

1317
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,200
foam targets where you can basically you

1318
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,240
have a foam matrix 3D printed foam

1319
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,599
matrix that you can just soak in

1320
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,359
liquidity instead of the ice layers that

1321
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,760
are used in current targets. So that

1322
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:15,359
would be a much cheaper path and and we

1323
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,599
do have one of our grad students is

1324
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:21,440
working on looking at asymmetries in

1325
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:23,280
wooded forms for example.

1326
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,000
Question online we could get to or I

1327
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,680
guess there are two but the first one um

1328
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,640
how can high performance computing and

1329
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,200
simulations help in ICF and MCF. I mean

1330
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:36,960
it's incredibly incredibly helpful and I

1331
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,720
think as you are going toward um you

1332
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:42,000
know projecting to fusion power plants

1333
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,760
in the next five 10 years uh they need a

1334
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,599
lot of simulations to back them up

1335
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,200
because your investors are wanting to

1336
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,680
invest a lot of money into these types

1337
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,760
of things. Um but you know on the other

1338
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,359
side of that like experiments are really

1339
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,000
at the end of the day are going to show

1340
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:58,400
you if it works or not. So um here at

1341
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,160
MIT there's a huge push on on both on

1342
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,400
both sides and people running in some of

1343
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,079
the biggest super supercomputers in the

1344
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,920
world. Anything you want? Yeah, I mean

1345
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,920
the the N is an excellent example of

1346
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,240
like kind of like that back and forth

1347
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,160
between experiments and simulations. I

1348
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,040
showed the the chart of how the gain has

1349
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,599
uh improved over more than a decade. uh

1350
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,280
at the outset the simulation people

1351
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,040
thought that we were immediately going

1352
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,640
to ignite actually dudded the fuel

1353
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,200
adding hydrogen into it because if you

1354
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,640
had pure DT it would just ignite and we

1355
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,880
get too many neutrons that we couldn't

1356
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,480
count uh but of course it turns out that

1357
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:34,160
there are more experimental problems

1358
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:37,040
than you think about uh so uh throughout

1359
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,880
the years the experiments have come back

1360
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,400
to simulations but then you can run a

1361
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,640
lot more simulations you can run

1362
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,559
experiments so the simulations have also

1363
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:46,480
guided what the next experiment ments

1364
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:49,119
would be and there's a continuous back

1365
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,359
and forth. Maybe last thing I'd just say

1366
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,960
that um machine learning is a is a huge

1367
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:56,000
thing that people are pursuing as well

1368
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,400
to try to make models more efficient or

1369
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,720
I mean some things are often hard to

1370
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,280
explain as well and so learning can take

1371
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,280
in a lot of

1372
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:08,880
data discover some

1373
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:10,559
physics other questions there's there's

1374
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,079
another online and we can take two but

1375
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:15,440
any in the room

1376
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:16,800
here I'll take this other one online

1377
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,760
real quick uh what recommend

1378
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,240
commendations do you have for

1379
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,240
undergraduates in engineering physics to

1380
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,440
get into fusion? What would you

1381
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,440
recommend pursuing a masters or

1382
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,680
prioritize finding experience after

1383
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,760
graduation? Yeah, these are great

1384
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,240
questions. I could take an initial stab

1385
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,000
at it. Um there are a lot of uh programs

1386
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,160
for internships and things I would

1387
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,240
suggest undergraduates look into.

1388
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,760
There's a program called u suli suli

1389
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:45,440
which allows you to work at a national

1390
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:47,440
lab in the US and and um kind of get

1391
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,359
into fusion and that's a lot of students

1392
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,760
here graduate students and myself came

1393
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:54,160
through that path um there also you know

1394
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,720
MIT has open courses you can start to

1395
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:59,839
learn from fusion online and now I would

1396
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,760
say in the past it you kind of you had

1397
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,839
to sort of go into grad school to get

1398
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,000
into fusion but that's no longer true

1399
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:09,280
with all these private companies I still

1400
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,760
think, you know, grad school's good. Uh

1401
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:15,280
I mean, but but maybe um masters

1402
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:17,359
infusion or um or or even having um some

1403
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,440
experience at a private company can help

1404
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,839
some people do a few years of work and

1405
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,200
then come back. So, uh look around at

1406
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:26,319
the different companies. They also have

1407
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,800
internship programs as well. Um and as

1408
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:31,440
to the national labs like Lauren Silver,

1409
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,559
summer internships. Yeah, I don't have

1410
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,079
much to add. I think you're actually

1411
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:38,000
perfect.

1412
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:40,400
Any other questions? Yeah. Um on

1413
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:45,599
inertial confinement, what's the primary

1414
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:48,400
limitation on um on rate of fire? So So

1415
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:50,240
I mean at the N the primary limit is the

1416
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,720
architecture of the laser. So like the

1417
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:56,359
you need to have the like the glass

1418
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,880
amplifiers cooled down. Um but in in the

1419
00:55:56,359 --> 00:56:00,480
future I mean it depends on the laser

1420
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,400
architecture.

1421
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,599
So the laser architecture itself rather

1422
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,119
than um injecting the pellet or I mean

1423
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,119
we have to figure out how to inject the

1424
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:13,200
pellet too but yeah but that doesn't

1425
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:16,319
limit the the rate at this point.

1426
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,680
Any final questions?

1427
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:19,119
I'm sure Maria and I can stick around

1428
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,119
for a few minutes, but maybe we should

1429
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,280
call this meeting to a close. So thank

1430
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,520
