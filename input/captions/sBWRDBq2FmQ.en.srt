1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,719
I'm going to introduce now my colleague

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,599
Ariana Rodenstein who is program manager

3
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,200
at the MIT startup exchange and she will

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,800
continue with the next part of this

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,800
presentation that will include two of

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,240
our startups in the area of

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,480
sustainability. So Ariadna

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,400
Jose thank you so much good to be here

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,960
and welcome everybody wherever you might

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,960
be today. So, we'll move on to the more

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,880
fast-paced lightning talks. Again, I'm

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,680
Marat Natenstein, program manager with

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,000
Startup Exchange. And to shortly, you're

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,320
going to hear from two very exciting and

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,320
very different startups, all members of

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,680
Startup Exchange. They are um working on

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,719
uh very novel uh solutions for problems

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,039
that could really be applied um and that

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,800
um we find in the real world as you will

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,879
see. and also especially at a time when

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,400
sustainability efforts and cost

22
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,240
reduction are crucial. But first I will

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,240
give a brief introduction of our

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,240
program.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,200
So MIT startup exchange was created to

26
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,159
support MIT connected startups as they

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,159
grow expand and solve some of the

28
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,840
world's greatest challenges and we do

29
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,680
this by fostering partnerships and

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,680
collaboration between the startups and

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,759
industry primarily members of the

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,439
industrializ program as I mentioned our

33
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,520
ILP who are represented by so many of

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,880
you here today and also the MIT

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,880
innovation ecosystem and

36
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:52,399
beyond. Sorry, the

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,640
um the startups in our program have a

38
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,159
very strong connection to the institute.

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,399
They may be based on MIT licensed

40
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,560
technology or founded by MIT faculty,

41
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,560
staff or alumni and they may also be

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,840
vetted by some of our MIT peers

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,080
including the engine start nano and cel

44
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,679
startup connect

45
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,920
plus. Our program has around a thousand

46
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,360
startups and they usually join at pilot

47
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,879
stage or beyond and of course they may

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,680
represent any sector and any geography.

49
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,520
Here you can see in bold some of the um

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,360
trending technologies of the startups

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,280
and those to be represented by the

52
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,520
startups presenting to you today. Of

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,319
course we start with AI and ML big data

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,599
and analytics and sustainability.

55
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,360
So when it comes to value, everything

56
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,599
that we do at Startup Exchange is really

57
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,440
to provide exposure opportunities and

58
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,280
connections for the startups with

59
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,280
industry and we do this in a very

60
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,120
customized approach. I hope everyone

61
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,440
will be taking advantage of the benefits

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,360
that you can see here on the screen.

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,200
These include when we launch calls for

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,160
startups, we call these opportunities

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,440
and they're based on a corporate's

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,360
um priorities and internal challenges.

67
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,440
And startups can apply on our website

68
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,599
and if selected, they can work with you

69
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,400
as an ILP member to help you solve a

70
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,599
problem that you may be facing in your

71
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,920
industry. We also host one-on-one

72
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,400
meetings, virtual demo days, other

73
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,879
webinars like today, and conferences

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,239
locally and internationally. And for

75
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,080
these we have startup lightning talks

76
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,599
and exhibits and we also create

77
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,640
workshops and trainings sometimes in

78
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,920
conjunction with our peers. And so with

79
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,440
that let's hear from the startups. Um

80
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,599
each speaker will present for five

81
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,280
minutes and then we will have Q&A for

82
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,680
two minutes. So I ask again that you

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,120
pose your questions to the Q&A tab and I

84
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,040
will get to as many of those as

85
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,239
possible. Let's keep this interactive

86
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,239
and dynamic.
