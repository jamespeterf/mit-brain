1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,720
we are um talking about how consumers

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,680
make decisions last time we talked about

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,359
preferences and utility functions and we

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,560
let you have as much money as you want

5
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,439
today the bad news today we impose a

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,000
budget constraint and talk about how

7
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,920
consumers actually make decisions

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,759
realistically when they face a limit on

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,800
their resources and that's what we focus

10
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:35,160
on today so let's start by talking about

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,800
what budget constraints are budget

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,960
constraints and let's start by Bud talk

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,960
about budget constraint

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,600
construction we're going to go back to

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,680
our

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,920
example um of pizza and cookies and in

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,079
particular for the next I don't know 19

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,039
lectures we are going to make the

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,480
critical assumption that your budget

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,680
equals your income that is there is no

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,519
saving or borrowing you consume all your

22
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,799
income okay we'll come back and talk

23
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,479
about people make savings and borrowing

24
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,080
decisions later sadly this is not a

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,040
terrible approximation for Americans the

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,119
average American has less than

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,880
$1,000 in available savings to access so

28
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,439
actually measuring saying your

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,840
consumption equals your income is not a

30
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:24,920
terrible approximation to the way most

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,439
people in America have to live their

32
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,119
lives today okay so but it's very

33
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,520
important to remember it's not we're

34
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,240
saying people don't save and borrow they

35
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,360
do both we're just going to leave that

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,960
complication to later and assume that

37
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,520
every penny you have you're going to

38
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,960
spend on consumption goods and in this

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,720
case it's just two consumption Goods

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,040
slice of pizza and cookies so you're

41
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,200
going to write your budget constraint as

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,240
your

43
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,200
income okay equals the number of cookies

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,079
times the the price of cookies plus the

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,960
number of slices of pizza times the

46
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:58,000
price of a slice of

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,479
pizza okay that is your total spending

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,280
on cookies will be the number of cookies

49
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,840
you eat times the number the price per

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,159
cookie your total spending on pizza

51
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,479
slices will be the number of slices you

52
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,679
eat times your spending per slice and

53
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,400
that will add up to your income because

54
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,400
you got to spend your

55
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,640
income and that leads us to what we see

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,680
in figure 31 which is the budget

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,239
constraint something you become very

58
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,200
very familiar with over the next over

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,319
the coming weeks okay it's just a graph

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,720
of this

61
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,319
representation the xaxis represents how

62
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,640
many cookies you'd get if you spend all

63
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,440
your income on cookies which is your

64
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,319
income divided by the price of

65
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,480
cookies the Y AIS represents how much

66
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,400
you'd get if you spend all your income

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,480
on slices of pizza which your income

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,599
divided by the cost of a slice of

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,200
pizza and the slope critically is the

70
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:50,000
opposite of is the negative price ratio

71
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,599
critically the slope is the negative of

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,200
the price ratio minus PC over

73
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,640
PS

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,360
okay this is critical and we're going to

75
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,280
come back to why this is such a critical

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,760
concept the slope of the budget

77
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,519
constraint let's start with an example

78
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,519
imagine that your income is

79
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:16,319
$24 that the price of cookies is

80
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:19,239
$2 and the price of slice of pizza is

81
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,319
$4 okay imagine those are the parameters

82
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,319
you were given now you might ask where's

83
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,519
your income come from where's the price

84
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,879
of cookies come where the price slice

85
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,080
come from these two things we will tell

86
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,159
you where they come from we get to

87
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,599
Consumer Theory producer Theory we'll

88
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,040
talk you about how firms set these

89
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,760
prices but during in consumer Theory

90
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,319
we're taking them as const as given okay

91
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,720
so for the consumer theory part of the

92
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,080
course for this lecture and next lecture

93
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,640
okay we take these things as given we

94
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,360
get to producer Theory derive where they

95
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,280
come from

96
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,879
income comes from how hard you work and

97
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,799
what are the sources of income you have

98
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,280
we'll talk about that in a few lectures

99
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,280
for the next Le couple lectur we'll take

100
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,959
that as given so for today's purposes

101
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,360
you are given an income you're given

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,640
price prices and you have to decide how

103
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,400
you're going to optimize your bundle

104
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,640
given your preferences and given that

105
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,799
budget constraint and what's cool about

106
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,079
this course like I said it's a layered

107
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,760
course we'll come back and tell you

108
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,599
where all these things come from but we

109
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,959
go step by step to develop it right now

110
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,519
we take the step of those things as

111
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,880
given

112
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,479
okay now what this means is the slope

113
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,759
the slope of the budget constraint in

114
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:28,080
this example is minus

115
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:31,360
one2 so minus the price of cookies over

116
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,840
the price slice of pizza is - 12 that's

117
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,440
the slope of the budget

118
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:40,199
constraint and we're going to call this

119
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,320
the marginal rate of transformation

120
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,400
remember yes last time we had the

121
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,440
marginal rate of

122
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,440
substitution this is the marginal rate

123
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,240
of

124
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,400
transformation this is the rate at which

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,120
you can effectively transform cookies in

126
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,080
a slice of pizza this is not a course

127
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,360
about alchemy we're not going to teach

128
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,759
you how to transform cookies into pizza

129
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,600
but given the prices in your income

130
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,039
opportunity cost dictates that every

131
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,800
time you eat a cookie you effectively

132
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,400
reading one half fewer slice of pizza

133
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,240
why because cookies cost half as much

134
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,320
and you have to spend your income so you

135
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,120
spend it on cookies you're not spending

136
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,000
on pizza and vice versa every S Pizza

137
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,639
you have effectively that's too fewer

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,440
cookies so you're effectively

139
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,039
transforming pizza into cookies and vice

140
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,520
versa through the market through the

141
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:27,160
market by choosing one you're not

142
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,520
choosing the other that's why we're

143
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,840
called the Dismal science that's the

144
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,520
concept of opportunity cost nothing is

145
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,000
nothing is free every cookie you have

146
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,360
means less pizza every Pizza you have

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,680
means less cookies okay so that is uh

148
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,400
exactly the application of opportunity

149
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,080
cost

150
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,759
so this is sort of a difficult concept I

151
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,919
think so I like to think about this in

152
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,440
perhaps the best real world example of

153
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,120
how people can use budget constraints in

154
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,560
their lives which is Weight Watchers you

155
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,759
guys are all young and fit uh it is sort

156
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,520
of amazing we'll come back and talk talk

157
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,479
about obesity later it is sort of

158
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,560
amazing you look around this room there

159
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,000
is you guys are incredibly young and fit

160
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,919
you realize that onethird of Americans

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,880
your age are obese onethird 0% of this

162
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,000
class and onethird of Americans

163
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,360
something to just think about as we

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,120
think about what's the role of the

165
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,880
government in dealing with the problems

166
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,360
of society to realize that we've really

167
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,880
separated a lot between the halves and

168
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,560
the have knots on many things not just

169
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,800
money but also Health okay let me ask a

170
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:34,120
question how many of you guys drink

171
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,120
calorie or non- calori

172
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,160
soda okay that is stunning okay that is

173
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,560
stunning 20 years ago it would have been

174
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,120
100% okay it is really amazing we've

175
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,919
switched away from soda we you all

176
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,280
exercise switched away from Bad eating

177
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,440
habits it's just sort of amazing but

178
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,039
only in the most educated populations

179
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,199
this happen it's really quite striking

180
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,360
anyway um but so for many people

181
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,639
struggling with your weight is an issue

182
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,960
and Weight Watchers has a program that's

183
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,000
very effective it's one of the a few

184
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:04,520
scientifically shown methods to actually

185
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,879
lose weight what does Weight Watchers do

186
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,319
they recognize that dieting does not

187
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,120
work telling people eat this and eat

188
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,039
that does not work there is no evidence

189
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,000
that any diet ever works okay what

190
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,199
Weight Watchers instead is establish a

191
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,720
budget constraint they say look we're

192
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,199
not going to tell you what to eat we're

193
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,599
just going to tell you what each piece

194
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,720
of food costs effectively in terms of

195
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:31,120
weight gain and we do that by assigning

196
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:36,199
each piece of food a weight so they say

197
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,280
for instance a carrot has zero points a

198
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,599
Snickers

199
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,560
bar has uh six points and you just add

200
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,840
up the points of what you eat up to the

201
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,440
point total you want to hit they say

202
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,199
look you tell us you can go wait watch

203
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,520
us and set it up for free you don't none

204
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,360
of you have to but when you're older uh

205
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,199
you can go set it up for free and you

206
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,120
basically say um what what weight do you

207
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,000
want to hit and they say okay this is

208
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,840
how many points you can have per day

209
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,400
plus you get cheat you get some cheat

210
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,039
points and if you hit if you consume

211
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,520
those points per day within X weeks you

212
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,159
will hit your goal weight but you decide

213
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,840
how to do it so for example let's say

214
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:13,440
you go to McDonald's for lunch and let's

215
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,360
say your budget's 30 points which is a

216
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,599
pretty typical budget okay what that

217
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,039
would say is for 30 points you if you go

218
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:23,159
to lunch for McDonald's and you get a

219
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:26,080
classic number one that's a Big Mac 14

220
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:28,960
points fries 10 points and a coke which

221
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,039
is six points that's 30 points on lunch

222
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,399
you're done

223
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:34,719
nothing else for the day on the other

224
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,919
hand you could say well wait if I got a

225
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,360
10piece nugget that's 12 points apple

226
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,399
slices is one point and a die Coke is

227
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,680
zero points you've only used 13 points

228
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,360
now unless you have strange tastes

229
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,720
that's a way worse lunch I mean who

230
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,720
wouldn't rather Big Mac and fries and a

231
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,800
coke than apple apple slices and chicken

232
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,920
nuggets I mean come on but is less than

233
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,040
half as expensive in terms of weight

234
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,399
gain and you can make that decision some

235
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,279
days you might might say screw it I want

236
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,720
a big lunch I'll skip dinner some days

237
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,320
you might say I got a I got a nice

238
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,920
dinner coming out a have a lower calorie

239
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,279
lunch but you decide because the budget

240
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,560
constraint is laid out for you and

241
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,720
that's why it's the most effective way

242
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,440
to lose weight because it put empowers

243
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,079
the consumer not follow arbitrary rules

244
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,440
but to follow their hearts within the

245
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:19,920
constraint it's basically what we're

246
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,720
going to do in this class of examed

247
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,600
optimization it says make yourself as

248
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,920
well off as possible subject to a

249
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,880
constraint and that constraint is

250
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,920
expressed in terms of the points

251
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,560
assigned to food so that's a great Weir

252
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,480
World example of how people can use

253
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,680
budget

254
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,279
constraints okay questions about

255
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,839
that okay let's now talk about what

256
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,440
happens when we run when we shock the

257
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,120
budget constraint when we in when

258
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,399
various things change to move the budget

259
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,360
constraint around let's talk about how

260
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:49,480
that works okay for example imagine

261
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,320
prices

262
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:57,399
change okay imagine the price of pizza

263
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:01,440
slices goes from $4 up to $6 a

264
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,560
slice $4 up to6 a slice what does this

265
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,320
do to your budget ex well that's

266
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,519
Illustrated in figure

267
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,120
32 note the xais the x intercept does

268
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,240
not change why does The X inter not not

269
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,839
change because if all you're buying as

270
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,519
cookies nothing's changed the only thing

271
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,560
that's changes if you want to buy slice

272
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:20,839
of pizza now instead of let's say you

273
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,399
only wanted Pizza instead of being able

274
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,240
to afford six slices on your $24 income

275
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,240
you can only afford four slices the

276
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,560
budget constraint has pivoted

277
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,920
Inward and the new slope hope instead of

278
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:39,000
being minus 1/2 is now minus

279
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,000
1/3 okay the opportunity cost of cookies

280
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,040
has

281
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,120
fallen the opportunity cost of pizza has

282
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:51,720
risen and critically your entire

283
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,600
opportunity set has shrunk you are worse

284
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,279
off why you're worse off because the UN

285
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,959
the area underneath the budget

286
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,320
constraint represents the full set of

287
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,839
choic that are available to you and that

288
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,160
area has shrunken this is a critical

289
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,600
Insight okay remember I'm going to

290
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,399
overstate that term okay which is

291
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,720
basically that your income hasn't

292
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,200
changed you still got 24 bucks all

293
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,360
that's Chang is price yet you're worse

294
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,760
off you're worse off because your income

295
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,639
is just a representation of what you can

296
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,040
buy as the price goes up you can buy

297
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,880
less so your opportunity set which is

298
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,240
the area under the budget con is shrunk

299
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,079
from the much larg area including the

300
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,360
light dots to only the darkened area so

301
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:30,959
it's a shrinkage in your opportunity set

302
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,160
because you can buy fewer stuff now once

303
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,440
again that's irrelevant if all you like

304
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,480
is cookies but for everyone else they

305
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,160
are worse

306
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,079
off okay so that's one example of how

307
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,399
the budget constraint can

308
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,200
change another example how the budget

309
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,920
can

310
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:51,240
change is your um your income can change

311
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,880
okay let's imagine for example um your

312
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,079
income decreases to $20 let's say

313
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,519
instead we'll go back to the original

314
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:00,079
prices but say your income goes from 24

315
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,560
to 20

316
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,880
okay well what happens there is

317
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:08,600
Illustrated in figure

318
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:11,000
33 now here it's a parallel shift in in

319
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,360
the budget constraint why is that why is

320
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,440
the budget constraint shift parallel as

321
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,360
opposed to

322
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,560
pivoting yeah SL do change the slope

323
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,839
doesn't change and

324
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,720
why yeah your the relative cost of pizza

325
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,360
and cookies has not changed the

326
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,000
opportunity cost of giving up cookies

327
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,720
for pizza is the same it's just you can

328
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,760
have less of both so it's say parallel

329
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,279
shift in in the budget

330
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,519
constraint but once again a shrinkage in

331
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:38,360
your opportunity set you are worse off

332
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:39,880
but for a different reason you're worse

333
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,000
off now for a more obvious reason which

334
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,519
you have less

335
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,800
money okay so two different changes one

336
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,839
changes one pivots the slope one just is

337
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,160
an inward parallel shift both reduce

338
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:57,000
your opportunity cost okay in both cases

339
00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:00,199
you are uh unambiguously worse

340
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,320
off you're worse off now you might say

341
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:02,320
well technically in the first case

342
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,199
you're not worse off you like only

343
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,199
cookies but remember taste can change

344
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:09,000
things can happen you might someday want

345
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,160
a slice of pizza so we say you're worse

346
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,639
off even if you're someone who choose

347
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,760
cookies your opportunities have shrunk

348
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,440
so you're still technically worse off

349
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,199
because you have fewer opportunities to

350
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,199
eat pizza

351
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,040
yeah so great question so the question

352
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,959
is like what what happens if there's

353
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,920
inflation Etc we'll cover all that once

354
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:30,800
again we're going to go in steps we'll

355
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,880
cover inflation and what it does but

356
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,480
obviously inflation would be like a

357
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,079
price change now what's interesting is

358
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,880
if it's uniform

359
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,440
inflation that would look like figure

360
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,720
33 right if all prices go up constantly

361
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,240
by a constant percentage that like

362
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,600
figure 3 three if it's differential

363
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,120
inflation if cookies and pizza have

364
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,880
differential inflation it look more like

365
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,959
figure

366
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,720
32 okay so what's going to happen is

367
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:57,720
going to depend on the nature of

368
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,720
inflation yeah

369
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,279
ah great question great segue to the

370
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,920
next point which is why wouldn't you

371
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,240
always be on the line and the answer is

372
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,519
you would be okay uh the opportunity set

373
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,720
is still a relevant concept because even

374
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,680
if you're on the line the opportunity

375
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,040
the line is lower but you're asking a

376
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,279
great point which is why would you ever

377
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,160
spend less than your income if you can't

378
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,759
spend more than your income and the

379
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:25,040
answer is you wouldn't okay so basically

380
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:28,000
now we come back to

381
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,120
combining what we learned last time with

382
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,440
what I just taught you and we come to

383
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:37,040
the fundamental um tool of consumer

384
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,040
Choice which is constrain

385
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,240
choice we said last time you want to

386
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,320
have as much as you can more is better

387
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,920
we said this time you can't consume more

388
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,920
than your budget constraint as this

389
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,079
points out as this question points out

390
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,360
that means you're going to choose a

391
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,959
point in your budget constraint in

392
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,519
particular you're going to choose the

393
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,519
highest possible indifference curve you

394
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,160
can reach given your budget constraint

395
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:07,800
in other words the you will optimize at

396
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,800
the point of

397
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,079
tangency between your budget constraint

398
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,000
your indifference curves and the

399
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,519
intuition is just what this gentleman

400
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,839
said higher indifference curves are

401
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,199
better you can only go as far as your

402
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,680
budget constraint therefore the best

403
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,160
possible choice is when the indifference

404
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,079
curve is tangent to the budget strength

405
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,720
that's the furthest out you can

406
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,560
get okay and we could see this

407
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,279
in figure

408
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,600
34 figure 34 is our first example of

409
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:39,399
making a strange Choice decision so what

410
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,480
we have here is the budget constraint I

411
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,480
laid out there and the utility function

412
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,240
we use last time utility is square root

413
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,959
of c x s of cookies time slices okay and

414
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,680
and the budget States the one up there

415
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,319
income of 24 price of cookies two price

416
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,720
of pizza

417
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:59,160
four that is Illustrated in figure 34

418
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,279
how's it Illustrated well you know to

419
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,120
draw the indifference curves we taught

420
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:04,079
you that last

421
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,839
time okay you know how to draw the

422
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,839
budget constraint I just taught you that

423
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,519
so just draw both and you find the one

424
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:15,240
with the tangency so the optimal choice

425
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:18,199
is going to be at Point

426
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,120
d That's the farthest possible

427
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:21,120
indifference curve that can be reached

428
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,800
given your

429
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,959
budget and this gives utility Point D

430
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,360
give utility of square otk of 18 now

431
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,680
once again that number is meaningless

432
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,680
but it's useful in an ordinal sense

433
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,560
which it lets us ask well could we do

434
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,759
better at another point so for example

435
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,279
take Point

436
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:45,680
e okay why what what would why what

437
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,040
would our utility be at Point e and why

438
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,120
can't we have it someone raise their

439
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,120
hand and tell me

440
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,519
yeah no point point e I'm sorry Square

441
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:02,279
32 right

442
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,959
yeah exactly so Point e square of 32

443
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:11,000
you're happier but it's not you can't

444
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:13,039
afford it okay what about um point a

445
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,720
this is on the budget constraint why

446
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,959
don't you choose that

447
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,480
point

448
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,640
yeah I'm

449
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,839
sorry yes so point a you can afford it

450
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,039
but it's a square root of 10 why would

451
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,320
you want

452
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:31,440
it okay the point is you can show

453
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,200
yourself and then similarly Point

454
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,320
C would be crazy because then as this

455
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,640
earlier question pointed out you're way

456
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,320
inside your opportunity set you're

457
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,039
wasting money so the bottom line is you

458
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,120
can show yourself graphically why the

459
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,000
tangency is is the best possible choice

460
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,720
you can

461
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,240
make okay now once again I want you to

462
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,840
understand this intuitively graphically

463
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,880
and now mathematically so let's do the

464
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,960
math of constraint Choice okay always

465
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,360
risk when I start writing math on the

466
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,679
board so if I make a mistake please

467
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,559
don't jump down my throat just kindly

468
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:09,919
put it point point it out to me okay um

469
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,520
all right so basically the key decision

470
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,120
consumers make and this is the one of

471
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,799
the harder intuitions in economics it's

472
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,520
never about how much you have it's about

473
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:23,240
the next thing you might want to get we

474
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,200
operate in marginal space we're always

475
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,720
about not how many cookies do I have but

476
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,200
do I want another one okay it's always

477
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,039
about the marginal ision we talked about

478
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,159
margin utility margin rate substitution

479
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:36,080
last time it's always about what is the

480
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:40,080
on the margin should I be moving in One

481
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,120
Direction or another okay and basically

482
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,679
if we said that the equili is the

483
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,200
tangency what's the slope of the

484
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,440
indifference curve the slope of the

485
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,120
indifference curve is the marginal rate

486
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,840
of

487
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,200
substitution we derived that last

488
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,840
time okay the marginal rate of

489
00:18:52,200 --> 00:19:00,720
substitution which is minus mu C over

490
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,720
muu s

491
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,320
what's now what's the tan what's the if

492
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,559
that's tangent that means that it's

493
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,600
equal to the marginal rate of

494
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,880
transformation at that

495
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:17,039
tangency we Define the marginal rate of

496
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:20,360
transformation as minus PC over PS and

497
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,880
that leads us to the fundamental rule of

498
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:28,799
consumer utility maximization which is

499
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:30,039
set mu C over mu or Marg is equal to

500
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,880
price

501
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:35,200
ratios utility is

502
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,919
optimized when margin the ratio of

503
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,559
margin utility equals the ratio of

504
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:42,200
prices we didn't have to think about

505
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:43,559
like we don't go and think like well

506
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,600
let's take eight piece slice of pizza

507
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:48,280
let's take 10 slice of pizza no we say

508
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,679
at the point we're at how do we feel

509
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,600
about incrementally trading pizza for

510
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,720
cookies pizza for cookies that's the way

511
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,039
to think about decision don't think of

512
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,640
like do I want eight slices of pizza or

513
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,760
five cookies or whatever no don't think

514
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,360
that way think from where I'm at today

515
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,080
do I want to move in One Direction or

516
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,720
another and the answer is you always

517
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,360
want to move in One Direction or another

518
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,320
until you get this

519
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,760
equality okay and if not you're not um

520
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,840
you're not

521
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:18,600
optimizing now basically this kind of

522
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,200
the fund the fundamental rule we do when

523
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,679
we do this constrain choice in economics

524
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,960
is we're always going to in general be

525
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,200
setting marginal benefits equal to

526
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,120
Marginal costs that's how we make

527
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,919
decisions in economics for every

528
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,480
decision we set the marginal benefit

529
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:34,760
that is the incremental benefit of a

530
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,760
decision equal to the marginal cost the

531
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,280
incremental cost and that's expressed

532
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,720
here what's the marginal

533
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:46,240
benefit what is the marginal benefit of

534
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,200
the next uh what's the what's what's

535
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,520
this ratio this is saying how much is

536
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:54,640
the next cookie Worth to me to me Rel to

537
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,360
pizza slices and what's going to cost me

538
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,400
Rel to pizza slices the maral benefit is

539
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,360
how happy I am with the next cookie in

540
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,600
terms of how much pizza I have to give

541
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,480
up the the cost is how much I have to

542
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,720
spend for the next cookie Rel to what

543
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,559
the next Pizza it's going to cost now I

544
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,799
find this is this is a I find this a

545
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:16,240
hard formula intuitively I like to

546
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,320
rewrite it for my own intuition in this

547
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:25,440
way I like to transform it and write it

548
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:27,120
as um mu u c over PC equals m over PS

549
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,080
and I call this a bang for the buck

550
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,480
equation think of as you want to consume

551
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,480
pizza and cookies until the ratio of

552
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,080
your happiness from each good to the

553
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,320
price of that good is equal to all the

554
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,840
other Goods it's your bang for your buck

555
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,120
your bang is your margin utility your

556
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,279
buck is what it's going to cost you okay

557
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,320
different ways of thinking about it and

558
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,360
once again this is something I need to

559
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:52,080
spend some time on

560
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:55,200
okay so let's think for a second about

561
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:59,240
why this rule makes sense imagine you

562
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:03,200
are in a place like you're on a place

563
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,200
where the Marg utility of

564
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,360
cookies over the Marg utility of pizza

565
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,880
is greater than the price of cookies or

566
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,000
the price of

567
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:16,320
pizza can anyone tell me what point on

568
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,679
this graph would illustrate that of the

569
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,440
labeled points which point would

570
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:26,440
illustrate that disequilibrium and

571
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:29,159
why which point illustrates a higher

572
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,240
marginal set of marginal utilities than

573
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:32,039
prices it's a hard question can anyone

574
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,799
get that

575
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:40,559
one uh yeah go

576
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:40,559
ahead uh uh and why would it be

577
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
C okay so that's a great it's not right

578
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,520
but a very illustrative wrong answer

579
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,320
because that illustrates why you want to

580
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,720
do marginal thinking economics you're

581
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,640
saying well Point C screwed up because

582
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,320
we're not spend anything we have well

583
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,640
that's irrelevant it's about the

584
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,960
marginal decision it's about the next

585
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,400
cookie versus is the next slice of pizza

586
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,679
so it's not Point C okay it's in fact

587
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,320
not Point D or E because at all of those

588
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:12,159
points this ratio

589
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,000
holds at points c d and e this ratio

590
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,840
holds at all those

591
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,880
points you're going to get those being

592
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:23,799
equal it's either point A or B anyone

593
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,799
know 50% chance

594
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:31,640
yeah exactly because at Point a the

595
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:34,480
univers Cur is cutting the quad strain

596
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,120
from above so it's a steeper slope so

597
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,480
this number this absolute value is

598
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,880
larger than this absolute value it's

599
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,919
cutting it from above so it's a steeper

600
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,080
slope of the inference curve than the

601
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,000
slope of the budget

602
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,480
constraint okay so here's how to think

603
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,159
about reestablishing equilibrium okay

604
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,080
what that says is at let's say this very

605
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,320
precisely listen this very precisely at

606
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,720
Point a it's so important I'm going to

607
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,840
read my notes okay the rate at which you

608
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,720
give the rate at which you're willing to

609
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:06,000
give up slices for

610
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,760
cookies is greater than the rate at

611
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,840
which the Market's demanding you give up

612
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,840
slices for

613
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,880
cookies okay so that is the marginal

614
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,360
benefit to you of another cookie in

615
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,279
terms of slices is greater than the

616
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,559
price to you of another cookie in terms

617
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:25,520
of slices so in other words at Point a

618
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,919
so let's show this mathematically okay

619
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,760
at Point a okay at Point a

620
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:32,039
what's the margin utility of cookies

621
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,480
well we used the same math we use last

622
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:36,679
time our utility function is square root

623
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,480
of C * s so what's the Marge utility of

624
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:40,679
cookies the margin utility of

625
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,919
cookies

626
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:48,520
is the derivative of this with respect

627
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:50,080
to C so it's 0.5 * s overun of s *

628
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,440
C

629
00:24:50,080 --> 00:25:00,320
okay Mar at Marge utility of pizza

630
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:05,520
slices 0.5 * C over Square < TK of s *

631
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,720
C okay that's our formulas at Point a

632
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,279
you have two slices of

633
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,159
pizza okay so this margin utility you

634
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,600
have two slices of pizza so this margin

635
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:19,679
utility is one over < TK of 10 and you

636
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:23,919
have five cookies this Marg utility is 2

637
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,919
and a half overun of

638
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:32,600
10 so the marginal utility so the margin

639
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,600
rate of substitution at this

640
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,640
point is minus

641
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:44,679
2.5 what does that mean that means you

642
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:47,640
would like you'd be willing to give up

643
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,600
two and a half slices of pizza to get

644
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,600
one

645
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,760
cookie you have so few cookies at Point

646
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,080
a that you're willing to give up two and

647
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,320
a half slices piece to get one cookie

648
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,120
let me just pause there it's from last

649
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,200
lecture people understand that

650
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,200
given your preferences

651
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,799
yeah the uh Square s * C I'm just it's

652
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,919
derivative of this it's just the

653
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,919
derivative formula the derivative of

654
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:16,919
square C * s is 0.5 s * well I wrote s

655
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,559
time c c * s doesn't matter it's but

656
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:21,159
it's just it's just it's the derivative

657
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,840
formula once again if you know this I

658
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:24,520
said I don't require h01 but you do need

659
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,559
to sort of know basic differentiation

660
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,360
stuff so I still don't know it it's

661
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,120
always good to review it okay other

662
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,240
questions okay so what this is saying is

663
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:37,399
your preferences are such that you would

664
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,880
be willing to give up two and a half

665
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:40,799
slices of pizza to get a cookie but

666
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,679
here's the question what does the market

667
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,679
tell you you have to give up how many

668
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:45,760
slices of pizza do you have to give up

669
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,159
to get a cookie in the

670
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,200
market how many how many house SLI pie

671
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,000
you have to get up to give a cookie

672
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,320
someone raise their hand tell me how

673
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,559
many slice of piece you have to go up to

674
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,559
get a

675
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:58,799
cookie guys are so afraid to get it

676
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,600
wrong you know this

677
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,120
someone raise their hand and tell me

678
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:07,200
yeah a half because cookies cost $2 and

679
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,840
Pieces cost $4 so you're saying I would

680
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,320
give up two and a half slices a piece to

681
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,640
get a cookie the Market's saying you

682
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,240
know what you only have to give up half

683
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,399
a slice of piece to get a cookie so what

684
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,880
are you going to

685
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:18,440
do what are you going to do buy more

686
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,240
cookies and less

687
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,679
Pizza the market is saying you can move

688
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,279
in direction that makes you happier you

689
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,880
can move in direction that that makes

690
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,440
you happier because right now you're

691
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,159
willing up a lot of pizza to get cookies

692
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,399
but you don't have to you only think up

693
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:36,960
half a slice of pizza to get cookies the

694
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:39,360
margin rate of substitution is greater

695
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,799
is greater than the marginal rate of

696
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,960
transformation which is minus a

697
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,120
half okay the marginate of substitution

698
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,559
is minus two and a half margin rate of

699
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,880
transformation is minus a half that's

700
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,480
why the slope of the indifference curve

701
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,559
is steeper than the slope of the budget

702
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,039
constraint therefore you're are willing

703
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,320
to make trades the market is happy to

704
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:00,039
let you make and so you should move and

705
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,399
you should continue to do that you'll

706
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:06,559
see by that logic you'll continue to do

707
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,320
that until you come to rest at Point uh

708
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,760
at Point

709
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,960
D okay now give my bad handwriting I'm

710
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,600
not going to go through the opposite

711
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,240
case I strongly urge you to go home

712
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,679
right away while still in your mind and

713
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,080
redo this for point B and show yourself

714
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,039
that you get the opposite conclusion at

715
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,399
point B you will find that you are happy

716
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,120
to give up a lot lot of cookies to get

717
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:33,960
pizza well the market says that's a

718
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,000
great deal you know you have to give up

719
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,279
two cookies to get pizza you're going to

720
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,120
be happy to give up lots more than two

721
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:40,919
cookies to get pizza so you move back to

722
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,120
the middle again so there is pressure

723
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,960
the disequilibrium between the margin

724
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,840
rate of

725
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,440
substitution and the margin rate of

726
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,880
transformation leads to pressure to move

727
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,320
to the point where they're equal there's

728
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,840
a natural equating equilibrating

729
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,360
mechanism which is the the the uh

730
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,240
difference between your preferences and

731
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,399
the Market's price will drive you to

732
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:03,399
equalize

733
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:06,320
those and that's it that's how we make

734
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:07,799
all decisions ever I've now explain the

735
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:12,120
entire process of human decision making

736
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:14,360
to you g newk psychology I'm just joking

737
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,559
but actually the truth is once again

738
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,640
this simple model we learned in a

739
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,799
lecture and a half remember last lecture

740
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,399
was short so really sort of a lecture

741
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:25,440
and a quarter okay can explain probably

742
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:29,399
90% of everything consumers do okay it's

743
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,720
incredibly powerful tool yeah

744
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:32,360
oh the margin substitution remember is

745
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,679
the negative of the ratio of margin

746
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,399
utilties definitionally margin rate of

747
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,120
substitution so it's the margin utility

748
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,120
of cookies which is one over s of 10 to

749
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,799
over the margin slices which is two and

750
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:46,159
a half over square of 10 and a negative

751
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,159
sign in front of it because it's definit

752
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,960
negative the marginal

753
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:59,000
you

754
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:59,000
uh what did I do wrong here

755
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,919
uh oh you know what I did wrong I did

756
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,399
this wrong the number remember we have

757
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,440
here we have how many slices of pizza do

758
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,360
we have at Point a we have five slices

759
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,840
of pizza so this is two and a half good

760
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,519
catch that's two and a half I did and

761
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,960
that's

762
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:18,320
one that's the mistake which is I put in

763
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,440
the wrong number of slice of pizza I

764
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,640
inserted here you should insert here the

765
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,320
number of slice good catch this is this

766
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,559
is five this is two so I inserted the

767
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,519
wrong numbers there so the ratio is

768
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,799
right I just got these wrong in the

769
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:33,720
margin chilly calculations that's a good

770
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:36,240
catch okay other questions and once

771
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,480
again please speak up on those things

772
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,679
okay because now look at all the people

773
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:45,200
you've helped you're a giver okay you're

774
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:48,279
welcome uh okay other questions about

775
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,320
that okay let's do an

776
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:54,279
example and for the example I want to

777
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:56,279
come to one of the most important social

778
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:59,080
programs we have in the United States

779
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:01,919
which is the snap program

780
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,960
supplemental nutrition and assistance

781
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,639
program traditionally when I was a kid

782
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,279
it was called food

783
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:12,880
stamps it's basically the program in the

784
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:15,399
US that gives M gives resources to

785
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,760
people they can use to buy food

786
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:20,760
essentially the way this program works

787
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,679
is if you're poor enough we give you a

788
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,880
debit

789
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,799
card and that debit card has a certain

790
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,440
amount of money on it that you can use

791
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:30,919
to buy food and the way it works is is

792
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,240
when you go to the grocery store there's

793
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:33,440
certain items that the debit card will

794
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,320
ring up for and certainly won't so if

795
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,840
you take a snap card and try to buy a

796
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,600
magazine it won't bring up for that you

797
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,960
can only use to buy

798
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,440
food okay it used to literally be you'd

799
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,240
get stamps and you'd have to sort of

800
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,559
embarrassingly hand them to the cashier

801
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,200
now it just looks like a regular debit

802
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,840
card the difference it can only be used

803
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,279
on certain items okay and basically

804
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,919
roughly speaking in the US we have

805
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:56,080
something called the poverty line we'll

806
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,080
come back and talk more about this the

807
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,600
poverty line is is what we assume is of

808
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,200
the minimum

809
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,960
standard uh above which you need to have

810
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,240
to live in America it's embarrassingly

811
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,120
low we say the poverty line for an

812
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,000
individual is about

813
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,919
$14,000 I don't know how I would live in

814
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,240
Boston on $4,000 but whatever but that's

815
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:16,080
the poverty line and basically if you're

816
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,960
below a little below the poverty line a

817
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,200
little bit above it you get like a

818
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,120
couple hundred bucks a month in food

819
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:26,120
stamps in in in on on your debit card

820
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,799
okay now what I want to do is ask the

821
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,679
following question why do we do this why

822
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,360
don't we just give people cash if we

823
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,159
want poor people to have money why don't

824
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,600
we just give them money and so we're

825
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,960
going to analyze the answer to that

826
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,880
question not through introspection but

827
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,519
through

828
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:44,000
economics so what we're going to do is

829
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:46,399
talk about how snap operates relative to

830
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,080
giving people cash so to do this let's

831
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:51,360
go to figure

832
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,120
3-5a let me walk you through this figure

833
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,720
this is sort of multiple things if if I

834
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,360
if I had a projector is be done in

835
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,440
animation there's multiple things going

836
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,279
on in this figure okay we have an

837
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,679
original budget constraint imagine

838
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,720
someone has

839
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,320
$5,000 imagine world where someone has

840
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,600
an income of $5,000 they're very

841
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,080
poor and all they could spend their

842
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:14,159
money on all they need all they could

843
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,120
spend their money on is either food or

844
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,679
shelter now once again you might say

845
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,080
well gee don't they need health or

846
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,200
whatever leave that alone we're in a too

847
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,720
good world you can ex you can make this

848
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,320
threedimensional in your free time okay

849
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,480
so basically think about a simple world

850
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,960
where people have $5,000 of income very

851
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,039
poor people and all they can spend on is

852
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,200
food or shelter and they spend all their

853
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:35,880
income of course so the original budget

854
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,039
constraint looks like the line that's

855
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,679
labeled original budget line what I'm

856
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:43,840
going to do is I'm going to assume that

857
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:46,960
the price of food equals the price of

858
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,480
shelter equals one this is a trick we

859
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,919
use in economics or in mathematics in

860
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,480
general it's called the numer

861
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:55,600
good we don't want prices to mess up the

862
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,720
math so just let's set the prices to one

863
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,480
it doesn't do any harm it's

864
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,360
generalizable and this way you could

865
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,360
think of dollars as quantities so the

866
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,840
amount you spend as the quantity you get

867
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,559
and since food and shelter are vague

868
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,200
Concepts anyway having to find what food

869
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,040
is it's a basket of food and shelters a

870
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,280
basket of living arrangements no harm

871
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,839
setting the price to one so basically

872
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,280
the ratio of the slope of The Bu train

873
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,960
is minus one we' set these prices to one

874
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,320
for some vague concept called food and

875
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,480
some vague concept called shelter we set

876
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,760
the prices to one we have a budget

877
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,679
constraint where the intercepts are at

878
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,560
$5,000 on each axis because that's all

879
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:31,359
the money you have and the slope is

880
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,919
minus one once again any question along

881
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:38,000
the way shout out raise your hand okay

882
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:39,960
now imagine the government decides and

883
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,760
this graph is not to scale I'll say that

884
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,599
right up right up front the government

885
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,560
decides they want to give every poor

886
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:50,399
person $500 they want to give every

887
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,200
person $500 okay every poor person $500

888
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,280
so for this person what that means is

889
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,839
they are now richer their opportunity

890
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,920
set has expanded their budget constraint

891
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,240
has shifted out in a parallel fashion

892
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,119
prices haven't changed they're just

893
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,760
richer so the budget crade has shifted

894
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:06,040
out from 55500 once again not to scale

895
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,280
but allows some space to illustrate

896
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:12,200
things easily so the new budget

897
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:14,640
constraint is at the point uh is the

898
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,960
same slope but the higher

899
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,960
intercepts now let's talk about two

900
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,280
different people and the choices they

901
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:25,640
make person

902
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,839
X likes shelter and doesn't care much

903
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,720
about food once again we can't judge

904
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,839
preferences preferences come from some

905
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,720
innate psychological basis okay it turns

906
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,560
out psychology does matter okay we can't

907
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,599
judge preferences but their preferen are

908
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,839
such that they don't need to eat a lot

909
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:42,200
but they really want shelter so

910
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,320
originally they spent of their $5,000

911
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,760
they spent almost nothing on food they

912
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,800
spend 4,800 on shelter and 200 on

913
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,160
food person why on the other hand

914
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,640
doesn't care much about shelter but

915
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,640
really needs to eat so they spent only a

916
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,640
hundred on shelter originally 4,900 on

917
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,640
food

918
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,520
now what happens when we give each of

919
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,359
them

920
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,240
$500 well I'm not going to go through

921
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,680
the math these are these are actual

922
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,960
choices and actual utility function I'm

923
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,640
not going to do the underlying math of

924
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:14,640
this but given these

925
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:17,240
preferences person X chooses to say look

926
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,000
I love shelter I'm taking four of my 500

927
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,720
bucks and spending on shelter so I'm

928
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,640
going to go from 4,800 bucks in shelter

929
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:27,119
and 100 and 200 on food to 5200 bucks on

930
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,960
shelter and 300 on food once again that

931
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,040
is it's mathematically consistent with a

932
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,160
set of preferences there's a set of

933
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,599
preferences that delivered that

934
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,280
outcome person y says look I love

935
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:37,400
shelter so I'm going to spend most of my

936
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,680
new money on

937
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,400
shelter so it just sort of reinforces

938
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,359
their preferences if you will they get

939
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,079
wider apart they both have they're both

940
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,319
better off but they they're more

941
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:49,560
different in their choices okay

942
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:53,040
questions about

943
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,319
that now is the hard part imagine the

944
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,560
government says you know what poor

945
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:59,440
people we're not giving you $500 in cash

946
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,680
we're going to give you a $500 debit

947
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,960
card that you can only spend on food not

948
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,720
on shelter how does this change the

949
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,839
budget strength here's the hard part

950
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:11,040
okay we start with the same original

951
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:12,920
budget straight in figure 3.5 B but now

952
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,520
it's different than giving them $500 in

953
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:19,560
cash and why is that that's because you

954
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,119
the for the first $500 in food there is

955
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,920
no opportunity cost in terms of

956
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:26,599
shelter if you spend you can get the

957
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,640
same amount of sh you can get the same

958
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:32,040
amount of of uh shelter if you spend

959
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:35,640
$100 on food or $200 on food or $500 on

960
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,640
food so the budet trade is now flat from

961
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:41,920
the Y AIS to the point

962
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,240
X2 it's flat and then it rejoins the

963
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,680
original budget

964
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,760
constraint why is it flat because think

965
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,760
about it the all those points on that

966
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,119
flat segment are now the feasible points

967
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,440
no matter if you want $5,000 in shelter

968
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,760
before if you wanted $5,000 in shelter

969
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,839
and you want to and you couldn't have

970
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,200
any food now you can have up to $500 in

971
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,920
food and still $5,000 in shelter the

972
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,520
budget constraint is now flat and then

973
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,040
rejoins the original budget constraint

974
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,000
at that point x

975
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,839
to okay we're going to practice in

976
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,720
section these kind of piecewise budget

977
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,720
constraints this is hard to do but you

978
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,040
get good at

979
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,000
it now let's ask what effect does that

980
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,599
have on people's choices well let's

981
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,880
start with person

982
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:25,000
y we've just said to person y we're

983
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,599
going to give you

984
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,480
$500 that you can only spend on food yet

985
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:32,240
it has the same effect as giving them

986
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,079
cash

987
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,000
why why for person why is there no

988
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,920
difference between the two panels even

989
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,880
though we've given them the debit card

990
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,319
they can only spent on

991
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:45,560
food why is there no

992
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:45,560
difference uh

993
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,560
yeah okay that that's that's uh that's

994
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,680
partly right but you've got the the

995
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,760
basic idea the important point is the

996
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,280
important point is the second part of

997
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,319
your sense they're already spending that

998
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,760
money on food anyway and money is money

999
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:11,920
so they can just say fine I'll take $500

1000
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,200
out of spending on food I'll call it

1001
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,599
snap and I'll replace it with $500 more

1002
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,319
I can spend on something

1003
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:21,319
else as long money is

1004
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:23,200
fungible as long as you're spending one

1005
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:25,280
$500 on food if I give $500 say it must

1006
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,520
be for food you're like whatever I was

1007
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,119
always spending $500 on food I'll just

1008
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:32,440
relabel it

1009
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,440
okay it doesn't affect my choices

1010
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,240
yeah no no no no they'll just spend it

1011
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,800
on in other words the point is think

1012
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,720
about when we give them cash this is

1013
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,760
confusing we give them cash they say

1014
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:47,280
great you give me 500 cash I'm going to

1015
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,839
take my consumption from 4,900 to 5100

1016
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,400
of of food um I'm going to take my

1017
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,040
consumption of food I'm sorry 41 to

1018
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,240
50100 I'm take my consumption of shelter

1019
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,599
from 100 to

1020
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,079
400 now I say oh no you have to spend I

1021
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:03,200
cast are like fine I don't care I still

1022
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,000
can I'm still going to spend 5100 on

1023
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,160
food and 400 on shelter I'm just going

1024
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,160
to label

1025
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,400
55100 snap but nothing else has changed

1026
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:15,920
just a labeling thing

1027
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:18,400
okay now think about person X they can't

1028
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,200
pull off that trick

1029
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,839
why why is person X person X now has to

1030
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,079
make a different Choice instead of

1031
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,880
choosing what they wanted which was X2

1032
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:32,280
they now have to choose X2 Prime which

1033
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,200
is where a different indifference curve

1034
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:39,240
hits that Kink where I3

1035
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Prime hits that Kink why why do they

1036
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,200
make have to make a different Choice

1037
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,800
yeah they can't we're not letting

1038
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,920
them so what has happened is by

1039
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,839
constraining this money to be on a debit

1040
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,520
card rather than

1041
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,960
cash we have changed their choice from

1042
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,079
what they wanted to do which is 5200 in

1043
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,839
shelter and 300 in food to now 5,000 in

1044
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:11,160
shelter and 500 in food we forced them

1045
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:13,280
to have less shelter and more food and

1046
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,920
what have we done to their well-being

1047
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,839
are they better off or worse off tell me

1048
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,480
why so raise their hand tell me why is

1049
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:21,400
person X better off or worse off when we

1050
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,400
can strain their choice

1051
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,440
yeah exactly more is better they're in a

1052
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,400
lower indifference curve they are worse

1053
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,680
off by constraining their choice we've

1054
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,599
made them worse off

1055
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,319
definitionally by giving people

1056
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:38,520
something other than cash we make them

1057
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:41,079
worse

1058
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,200
off but we do it

1059
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:45,760
anyway and to see why let's think of a

1060
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,319
simple change to this diagram which

1061
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,720
represents the way policy makers think

1062
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:53,839
about poor people cross out on the Y AIS

1063
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,240
cross out the world shelter and put in

1064
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,240
the word cocaine

1065
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:00,280
basically policy makers think we can't

1066
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,400
give these guys money because they'll

1067
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,800
just spend it badly they won't spend it

1068
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,160
on things we want them to spend it on we

1069
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,359
want them to spend it on food we're

1070
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,920
going to force them to spend it on food

1071
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:10,800
to make sure they don't waste it that is

1072
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,400
policy makers think look there's a third

1073
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,280
option which is cocaine or alcohol or

1074
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,119
whatever and we don't want them spending

1075
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,240
money on that so we are going to force

1076
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:24,160
them to make sure they have the

1077
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:26,839
food so that is why we have these kinds

1078
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,440
of what we call in-kind benefits indeed

1079
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:31,000
as teach you later semester and as I

1080
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,160
spend a whole section of my course 1441

1081
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,920
talking about the US government

1082
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,079
redistributes in Goods vastly more than

1083
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,640
in cash the amount of money we give poor

1084
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:43,359
people in Goods is something like 10

1085
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,880
times the amount of money we give poor

1086
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:48,440
people in cash between Medical Care

1087
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,960
housing and food those programs add up

1088
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,119
to about 10 times of how much money we

1089
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,200
give people in cash maybe five to 10

1090
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:58,319
times okay because of this exact problem

1091
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,960
because we think that we know better

1092
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,200
government policy makers think that we

1093
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,920
don't want to give people cash reward

1094
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,680
what they spend it on so this raises the

1095
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,200
natural

1096
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,839
question

1097
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:14,760
of actually raises two

1098
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:18,520
questions one is the positive

1099
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:21,520
question of what effect does this have

1100
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,680
that is how much more food do we get

1101
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,000
people to eat by giving them debit cards

1102
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,040
rather than cash you don't know the

1103
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,960
answer from this graph because maybe

1104
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,319
everyone's like why

1105
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,800
maybe no one's affected by maybe

1106
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:35,760
everyone so maybe the answer is zero

1107
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,839
okay the answer is and we've done this

1108
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,680
from experiments we basically convert

1109
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,599
we've we'll talk a lot about in this

1110
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,119
course about experiments run economics

1111
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:46,559
and really a Pioneer in that field is

1112
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:47,920
our Nobel prize winning couple of uh es

1113
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,000
Duo and abijit

1114
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,280
bannery uh they've sort of pioneered the

1115
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,839
use of of wides skill experiments in

1116
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,000
economics one such experiment was run to

1117
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:01,079
actually randomly give some people cash

1118
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,119
and some people uh food stamps and what

1119
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:05,960
they found was it does I'm sorry snap

1120
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:07,720
giving snap does increase consumption of

1121
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,000
food that is there's enough X's out

1122
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,599
there that on average for every dollar

1123
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,760
you give in food stamps rather than cash

1124
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:16,240
you get about in sorry snap sorry about

1125
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:19,880
that for every dollar given snap rather

1126
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:22,160
than cash you get about 15 cents more in

1127
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,040
food consumption not a dollar there's

1128
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,680
some people like why but basically up

1129
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,160
all the X and y's by giving people snap

1130
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,720
instead of cash you do change their

1131
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,720
consumption

1132
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,280
Behavior okay so the positive question

1133
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,760
is is snap having his intended effect

1134
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,160
the answer is

1135
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,200
yes the normative question is should we

1136
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,880
do

1137
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:50,119
this should we force people to be take

1138
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:52,599
their take their uh good in um take

1139
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:55,839
their goods in food rather than cash and

1140
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:58,319
here once again we come to the value of

1141
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:00,440
experiments it's a hard question

1142
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,119
ask but this is where experimental

1143
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,319
economics once again is pired here and

1144
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:06,240
by their third Nobel Prize winner

1145
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:08,480
Michael Kramer who's now Chicago du Flo

1146
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,160
benergy and Kramer set up something

1147
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,200
called

1148
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,640
japal the jam poverty action lab it's in

1149
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,640
the department of Economics here at MIT

1150
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,359
it is now the preeminent organization in

1151
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,480
the

1152
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:24,280
world for using experiments like real

1153
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,760
scientists do to actually answer

1154
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,800
economic questions to basically say as

1155
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,760
an interesting economic question want to

1156
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,839
answer answer let's answer by randomly

1157
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,400
running an

1158
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:35,559
experiment so for example JP palal has

1159
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,880
now run dozens of experiments with the

1160
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:39,680
experiment with giving people in

1161
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,440
developing countries cash they mostly

1162
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,920
focus on developing World okay giving

1163
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,520
people developing countries cash versus

1164
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:51,200
giving them

1165
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:53,559
goods and the answer seems to be that

1166
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,400
basically we should give people

1167
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:59,000
cash they basically give people cash

1168
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,839
very little of it getss spent on bad

1169
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,559
things almost all of it gets spent on

1170
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:06,599
education for children or food or

1171
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:09,520
shelter but

1172
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:11,520
moreover giving very poor people cash

1173
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,000
allows them to make investments to

1174
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,079
escape poverty so did is they took a

1175
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,720
group of poor women in Uganda and gave

1176
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:22,960
them $150 you might think wow big deal

1177
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:26,079
$150 that is 50 to 100% of the annual

1178
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,839
income in Uganda let's be clear okay

1179
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,480
okay the

1180
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:33,040
about half the world lives on less than

1181
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:36,119
$2 a day okay so $150 big big money in

1182
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,720
Uganda what they found was and they gave

1183
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:40,760
some women that they randomly gave other

1184
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:43,400
women did not give them the money what

1185
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,400
they found is 18 months later the women

1186
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,280
who gotten the cash had raised their

1187
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,520
earning had doubled their earnings why

1188
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:52,200
because they used that cash to set up

1189
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,640
little shops to buy a cow to invest in

1190
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,040
how they could make more money so not

1191
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,880
only do they spend very little of it on

1192
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,880
things you might consider bad they Ed it

1193
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,559
in a productive way we even foresee to

1194
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,880
invest in their own Futures and get

1195
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:06,800
better off there's a recent experiment

1196
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,280
in um gosh I don't remember was you

1197
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,079
might have read of where they gave

1198
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,160
homeless people in the US $7,500 a small

1199
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:14,160
sample of homeless people like 60

1200
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,680
homeless people and they found that once

1201
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,440
again they spent most of it on getting

1202
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,920
their lives back together not on

1203
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,920
dangerous goods it's not to say that we

1204
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,200
shouldn't worry about people consuming

1205
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,280
dangerous goods we'll talk a lot about

1206
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,119
this this semester it is to say that

1207
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,119
when we want make a decision Economic

1208
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:33,920
Policy we look to the evidence and the

1209
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,800
evidence is a the positive evidence is a

1210
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,880
giving snap cards rather than cash

1211
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,920
changes people's behavior and B they

1212
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,160
seem to be better off if we give them

1213
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,960
cash okay and that's how we use the

1214
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,880
tools of Economics to make informed

1215
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:49,359
policy decisions okay let's stop there

1216
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,920
we'll come back next time and talk about

1217
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:54,440
how more putting this all together first

1218
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,000
problem set is handed out Friday it is

1219
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,280
due in two weeks because we have no

1220
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,960
section next Friday at 5:00 p.m. in 2

1221
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,960
weeks on September 30th
