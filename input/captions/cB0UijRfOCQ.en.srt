1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,960
Good morning. Good morning. Welcome.

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,400
Welcome to lecture 11 of 6120 61200. I

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,600
never know how to pronounce it. It's one

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,160
of them probably. Um we have finished

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,400
our number theory unit and we're now

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,679
starting a new unit on graphs. Graph

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,000
theory. Um this is a a new topic, a new

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,800
kind of mathematical abstraction that

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,360
we'll see oops that we'll see um really

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,680
interesting uses for across this class,

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,480
across algorithms, across other contexts

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,640
as well. Um before we dig into what

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,920
they're good at, let's talk about a bit

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,480
about what they are, how they're

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,559
defined. Uh so I've written an example

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,600
of a graph up here. Totally clear,

17
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,719
right? It's easy to read and comprehend.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,039
Um but let me define it for you. So a

19
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,719
simple

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,239
graph

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,239
let's say a simple undirected graph

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,080
which are the only kind of graphs we'll

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,680
be talking about for the next couple

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,680
lectures

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,680
um is defined as a pair.

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:29,280
So G is the graph G is a pair V comma E

27
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,280
where V is a non

28
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,799
empty set

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,799
of what we call nodes

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,119
also known as vertices.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,119
Um

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,000
and

33
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:57,159
E is a set

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,159
of two element subsets

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,240
of V. Not all of them but some of them

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,320
possibly none of them could be all of

37
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,920
them as well where um any amount that

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,560
you want. So a graph is just a set of um

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:16,280
a set V um where we call the objects

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,280
vertices or nodes. Um, sorry.

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,200
These are edges.

42
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,440
So, it's a set V of nodes and a set E of

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,280
pairs of nodes. And those pairs are

44
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,519
called edges. So, in its purest set

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,160
theoretic form, here is a graph. Here's

46
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,760
a set of vertices. Here's a set of some

47
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,319
of the two element subsets of V. Of

48
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,760
course, I don't really think about the

49
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,720
graph in this form.

50
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Let me give you an alternative way to uh

51
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,680
express this graph up here.

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,280
One, two, three, four, five, six, 7. Uh

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,120
these are going to be my nodes. This is

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,640
A, this is B, C,

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,720
uh D, E, F, and G.

56
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,959
And anytime we have an edge, let's

57
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,040
connect them by drawing an arc between

58
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,840
them. So we have AB, AC, and BC. We have

59
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,360
these, these, these, this, this, and

60
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,519
this. This is a visual representation of

61
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,760
this graph, but it's conveying the same

62
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,080
information. This is a lot easier to

63
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,599
look at in my opinion, but they're both

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,080
conveying the same information. This is

65
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,239
the general idea of a graph. It's a set

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,720
of vertices which are the dots and edges

67
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,040
which are the segments connecting them.

68
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,360
Does that make sense?

69
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,159
Wonderful.

70
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,000
Um I want to mention that there there

71
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,120
are some subtle differences in the

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,120
definitions in other sources. Um

73
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,120
sometimes

74
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,439
uh sometimes uh when people are talking

75
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,439
about undirected graphs

76
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,439
um some people will allow what are

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,439
called parallel edges.

78
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,439
Oops.

79
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,000
which is when you have two different

80
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,560
edges connecting the same pair of

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,199
vertices.

82
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,759
Um or

83
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,759
uh self loops

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,800
which is when you have a single edge

85
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:33,560
connecting a vertex back to itself

86
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,560
and we are disallowing both of those.

87
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,040
So we will never be working with graphs

88
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,400
like this that have parallel edges or

89
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,880
that have self loops. Uh so that is what

90
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,479
what people usually mean by simple. Um

91
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,840
and it's why all of the undirected

92
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:55,560
graphs we work with are going to be

93
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,560
simple. Um likewise some sources

94
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,680
allow the vertex set to be empty. U I

95
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,400
stipulated up there that V should be a

96
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,400
non-MP set.

97
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,560
Um,

98
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,479
so we're just disagreeing on a single

99
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,320
graph that has zero vertices and then

100
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,280
necessarily zero edges because there's

101
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,759
nothing to connect. Um, the reason we

102
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,600
are not allowing that for our purposes

103
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,120
is that often it's going to be a counter

104
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,120
example to a lot of the theorems we want

105
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,680
to state. We would always have to say

106
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,440
for every non-mpy graph, for every graph

107
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,560
with a positive number of vertices,

108
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,960
something like that. And it just gets

109
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,639
cumbersome. Um, so we chose this

110
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,800
definition because it makes that more

111
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,919
convenient. Not really a big deal, not

112
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,400
really something we'll need to think

113
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,560
about much. It's just a part of the

114
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,479
definition to be vaguely aware of in the

115
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:52,039
back of your mind. Um,

116
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,039
we do allow

117
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,160
the set of edges to be empty.

118
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:03,280
For example, here is a graph

119
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,120
with five vertices and zero edges. Let's

120
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,160
call them vertices one, two, three,

121
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,000
four, and five. Five vertices, zero

122
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,440
edges. That's totally fine. That's a

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,160
valid graph. Uh so this has an empty set

124
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,919
for the set of edges, which is fine. All

125
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,800
right. Um so what are graphs good at? Um

126
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,800
graphs are great at representing um

127
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,919
two-way relationships between pairs of

128
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,800
objects. Uh let me give some some real

129
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,120
world examples like friendship. Um you

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,479
can imagine the graph of all the friends

131
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,880
in the world. Uh the the vertices here

132
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,280
let's see the friend

133
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,960
graph

134
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,280
the vertices are going to be the set of

135
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,280
people

136
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:53,400
each person is a vertex. The set of

137
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,400
edges is pairs of friends.

138
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,360
Now I'm making an assumption here that

139
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,639
friendship always goes both ways. If I'm

140
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,919
friends with you then you're friends

141
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,599
with me. No unrequited friendships here.

142
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,560
Um,

143
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,000
for example, Facebook friendships always

144
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,960
go both ways. You're either friends on

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,280
Facebook or you're not. Um, so the graph

146
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,360
of Facebook friends is a concrete

147
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,560
representation of this kind of thing

148
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,639
which is which can be interesting. Um,

149
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,560
whoops.

150
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,240
Uh, let's see. Another example is the

151
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,560
brain.

152
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,400
The brain is just a network of neurons.

153
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,400
The neurons are the vertices.

154
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:36,319
neurons and connections.

155
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,360
Some neurons connect to neighboring

156
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,000
neurons and it's those neurons and their

157
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,080
connections that somehow creates

158
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,639
cognition and memory and intelligence

159
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,120
and I wish we understood how but at

160
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:54,599
least it's a graph.

161
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,599
Um, also we have the internet.

162
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,879
Um most network connections on the

163
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:04,360
internet go both ways

164
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,360
network connections.

165
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,879
So the servers are the vertices and the

166
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,840
which servers can talk to which other

167
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,360
servers u are the edges. Uh and most

168
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,360
communications have to go both ways

169
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,720
because you have to like communicate

170
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,280
back and forth and make sure that each

171
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,360
of you trusts the other party before you

172
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,840
actually send any information over. So

173
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,160
you have to go both ways to to make that

174
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,680
connection first. Uh and then you can

175
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,240
send information in whatever direction

176
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,240
you want. Um a non-example

177
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,959
is hyperlinks on websites.

178
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,279
If site A has a link that takes you to

179
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,360
site B, there isn't necessarily a link

180
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,680
back. Um so this would not be an example

181
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,440
of an undirected graph. That would be a

182
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,480
directed relationship which we're going

183
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,800
to talk about later after break. Um but

184
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,360
that's not an example for today.

185
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,360
Similarly, Twitter followers is a

186
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,440
directed relationship. If I follow you,

187
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,440
you don't necessarily follow me. So that

188
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,040
would be a directed graph which will fit

189
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:14,480
into um into lectures after break, not

190
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:17,920
this one. Um all right.

191
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,560
And graphs uh I said earlier graphs are

192
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,200
a really useful abstraction. And I claim

193
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,279
that they're useful because uh they

194
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,600
strike a nice balance between simplicity

195
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,600
and complexity.

196
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,560
On one hand, graphs are simple to define

197
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,720
and describe. They're simple

198
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,839
conceptually. It's just a set of objects

199
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:47,519
and a set of pair-wise relationships.

200
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:49,839
um easy to define. So, as we just saw,

201
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,000
there are lots and lots of real

202
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:55,120
scenarios that can be modeled faithfully

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,440
as a graph. On the other hand, they're

204
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,360
complex in that there's a rich

205
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,360
mathematical theory of graphs.

206
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,680
There are lots of powerful tools and

207
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,519
definitions and theorems that we can

208
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,079
bring to bear anytime we're trying to

209
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,320
analyze a graph and therefore we can

210
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,920
apply all of that to all the real world

211
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,399
scenarios that we have been able to

212
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,200
model as a graph. So it's a really nice

213
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,839
balance between the two.

214
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,600
Um so let's dig into this rich

215
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,800
mathematical theory and see what what

216
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,800
tools and theorems we can develop.

217
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,160
So the next definition is vertex degree

218
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:49,720
um sorry the next definition is um

219
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,720
adjacency. Let's see.

220
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:58,279
Two vertices U and V are adjacent

221
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,279
adjacent

222
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,519
if and only if

223
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:10,839
um they're connected

224
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,839
by an edge.

225
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,600
i.e. UV is one of our edges.

226
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,120
So there vertices are adjacent if

227
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,279
they're connected by an edge. Um we'll

228
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,279
say that

229
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,480
uh let's see

230
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:38,200
an edge UV

231
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,200
has end points

232
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,800
U and V.

233
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,519
Just the the two end points of the edge.

234
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,519
And we'll say that

235
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,560
edge uv

236
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,560
is incident

237
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,839
to u and v.

238
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,839
So a vertex and an edge are incident if

239
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,040
that edge has that vertex as one of its

240
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,880
end points. Um these words sound a

241
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,040
little alike. Adjacent is used for two

242
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,120
vertices that have an edge between them.

243
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,200
Incident is used for an edge and a

244
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,920
vertex where the vertex is an endpoint

245
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,680
of the edge. Um but useful terminology.

246
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,200
Uh and that lets us define the next

247
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,839
thing

248
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:32,800
which is for a vertex V.

249
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:35,839
Uh the degree of V

250
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,320
is the number

251
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,480
of edges

252
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,480
uh incident

253
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,920
to V. So the degree of a vertex is the

254
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,839
number of edges it has. So what's the

255
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,839
degree of E? Just yell it out.

256
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,839
Three. Yeah. One, two, three. What's the

257
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,760
degree of C?

258
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,079
Four. Degree of f two. What's the degree

259
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,519
of this vertex two?

260
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,519
Zero. It doesn't have any edges.

261
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,079
Excellent. Degree is just the number of

262
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,240
incident vert uh incident edges.

263
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,720
Wonderful.

264
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,880
Uh you can understand some not

265
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,600
everything but some things about a graph

266
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,720
just from the degrees of its vertices.

267
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,720
Uh for example uh that graph way over

268
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,959
there on the left. The degrees of its

269
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:31,279
vertices are let's go through them all.

270
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:33,519
We've got 2 2 4 3 3 2 in that order. I

271
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,040
think I got that right. Sometimes this

272
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,959
is called the degree sequence.

273
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,680
That's less important than the degree

274
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:44,320
itself um than the concept of degree

275
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,079
itself. But we can we can play with this

276
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,720
concept a little bit. For example, does

277
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,720
there exist a graph

278
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,880
with degree sequence 2 2 1?

279
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,639
Sorry, that's supposed to be a question

280
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,880
mark. There we go. Does there exist a

281
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,440
graph with degree sequence 221? So,

282
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,920
three vertices, two have degree 2, one

283
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,920
has degree 1.

284
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,600
Think about that for a second and then

285
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,600
we'll try it together.

286
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,920
Okay, I see someone violently shaking

287
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,639
their head. I think they're cracking

288
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,760
their neck.

289
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,959
Uh, let's try it. Um, so 221 means we

290
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,920
need three vertices. One, two, three.

291
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,440
Um, first vertex has degree two. Well,

292
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,600
there's really only one way to do that.

293
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,760
It has to connect here and here. The

294
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,279
next vertex also has to have degree two.

295
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,959
Well, that means it also has to connect

296
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,040
there. Only way for it to get a second

297
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,079
edge. Then the third vertex is supposed

298
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,279
to have degree 1, which it doesn't. So

299
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,800
we're sad it didn't work. Um, you can

300
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,680
think of this, by the way, as a proof by

301
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,920
contradiction. Um, if there were a graph

302
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,600
that satisfied this, then it would have

303
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,320
to look like this. But this graph

304
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,959
doesn't work, so nothing works.

305
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,800
Sound good? Okay. But what if we asked a

306
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,800
more complicated uh version of the

307
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,800
question? Does there exist a graph with

308
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,360
degree sequence two two two

309
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,800
one?

310
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,560
This time there would need to be six

311
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,240
vertices and now there are lots of ways

312
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,959
that we could choose two edges for each

313
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,639
of those vertices. Um so there are lots

314
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,079
of cases that we would need to try out

315
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,760
in our proof by contradiction. Um so

316
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,760
maybe a different strategy would work

317
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,600
better. Does there exist a graph with

318
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,199
this degree sequence?

319
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,480
Yes.

320
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,079
always.

321
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,160
No, because the sum always has to be

322
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,399
even. Interesting. Why does the sum have

323
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,399
to be even?

324
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,519
All right. So, if an edge connects to

325
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,079
one vertex, then it also can connects to

326
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,880
another vertex. So, each edge is somehow

327
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,639
counted twice. Yeah, that's exactly the

328
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,320
right intuition for the following

329
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,040
theorem. In fact, that's the correct

330
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,920
proof for the following theorem. Um,

331
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,920
we've got the handshake

332
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,399
shake lema.

333
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,639
Let's see.

334
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:19,040
For graph G, which is vertices and

335
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,839
edges, we have the sum

336
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,360
of vertices in the set of vertices of

337
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,360
the degree of that vertex equals. So if

338
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,519
you take all the degrees and add them

339
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,880
all up, um your colleague here claimed

340
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,079
that what you're going to get is 2 times

341
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,920
the number of edges.

342
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:42,399
And we can see that for this example, if

343
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:45,440
we add this up, 4 8 14 16 18 and there

344
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,199
are nine edges, that checks out.

345
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,360
Um

346
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,440
and the reason this is true is also

347
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,279
exactly what your colleague said earlier

348
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,680
over here. We're adding the degree of

349
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,160
every vertex

350
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,680
um which means we're basically counting

351
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,600
every end point of all the edges and

352
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,559
every edge has two end points. So every

353
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,760
edge was counted twice in this count on

354
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,199
the left. So that's the handshake lema.

355
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,039
It's called handshake lema because if

356
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,000
you imagine a room full of people and

357
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,360
some pairs of them shake hands, then if

358
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,520
each person counts the number of

359
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,039
handshakes they had and you add that all

360
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,280
up, that equals two times the number of

361
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,480
handshakes because each handshake had

362
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,079
two hands involved. Um it's exactly the

363
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,160
same explanation and proof. It's just

364
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,039
with hands

365
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,720
uh instead of um pairs instead of half

366
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,080
edges.

367
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,799
Um all right. So does this help us with

368
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,799
that?

369
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,559
Can someone tell me why there doesn't

370
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,559
exist a graph with this degree sequence?

371
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,240
Yes.

372
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,200
Yeah, because the sum is odd. Um, this

373
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,440
would have to have what? 11 divided by

374
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,440
two edges,

375
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,640
which isn't great. Uh, I don't know how

376
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,840
to draw a half edge in these graphs. So

377
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,000
there is no such graph. Awesome. Here's

378
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,840
one more application of the handshake

379
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,480
lema. Uh let's see.

380
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,640
What is the maximum

381
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,880
number

382
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,880
of edges

383
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,320
in an nvertex

384
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,320
graph?

385
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,679
What is the maximum number of edges in

386
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,640
an nvertex graph?

387
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,640
Um well

388
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,240
each vertex

389
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,080
has degree at most n minus one because

390
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,240
at most it connects to all the other

391
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,520
vertices. There are no other vertices to

392
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,280
connect to. You can't connect to

393
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,360
yourself. You can't repeat any

394
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,960
connections. Uh once again that's what

395
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,000
we meant by simple graph and all our

396
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,919
graphs are simple. Um so every vertex

397
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,960
has degree at most n minus one.

398
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,960
So the sum of the degrees

399
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:19,679
uh is at most n * n minus one.

400
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,640
But the sum of the degrees is equal to 2

401
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,600
* the number of edges.

402
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,880
So the number of edges is at most n * n

403
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,799
minus one / 2.

404
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,760
Didn't have to do any fancy induction.

405
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,520
Didn't have to compute some sum. I

406
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,520
wonder if this equals a sum that we've

407
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,679
seen before.

408
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,120
Um,

409
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,360
but so we have an upper bound. The

410
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,240
number of edges is at most that. And

411
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,240
turns out this is achievable

412
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,559
achieved by the complete graph

413
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:06,039
kn which is the graph with n vertices

414
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,039
and all possible edges.

415
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,480
So this vertex connects to everyone.

416
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,640
This vertex connects to everyone. This

417
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,960
connects to everyone. Connects to

418
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,720
everyone. I think I got them all. So

419
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,160
this is a drawing of K6.

420
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,559
There are six vertices and everyone

421
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,120
connects to everyone. This graph indeed

422
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:31,679
has every vertex with degree N minus

423
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:34,400
one. So it has exactly this many edges.

424
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,960
Um the K for KN this is standard. You'll

425
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,679
see KN uh everywhere. I think it comes

426
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,280
from German. Uh it kind of sounds like

427
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,080
complete graph, right? Um, but we'll be

428
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,159
using this notation a lot.

429
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,159
All right,

430
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,799
let me ask another question. Um,

431
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,080
so most of us here are MIT students. I

432
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,840
know we have some crossregistered

433
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,640
students. Welcome. You're um I'm glad

434
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,840
you're here. Um, for the MIT students in

435
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,000
the room, do you have any friends at

436
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,159
Harvard?

437
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,799
Yeah. Awesome. Um, okay. So, I got at

438
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,919
least one hand. I got more than one

439
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,840
hand. But let me ask, how many Harvard

440
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,760
friends do you think the typical MIT

441
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,919
student has? Don't answer that. It's

442
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,000
rhetorical. Uh, what about the reverse

443
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,799
question? How many MIT friends does the

444
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,159
typical Harvard student have?

445
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,320
Which one's bigger?

446
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,440
Let's see. So on one hand we've got the

447
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:39,080
average number of

448
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,080
Harvard friends

449
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,039
for the typical MIT student

450
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,880
or the average number of MIT friends for

451
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,880
the typical Harvard student.

452
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,840
Which one's bigger? And how could we

453
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,559
know? How do we how can we decide this?

454
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,559
Maybe I could do a big survey. I could

455
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,200
sample a bunch of MIT students, sample a

456
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,039
bunch of Harvard students, um take the

457
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,000
average of whatever is reported and and

458
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,960
take that as ground truth. Um that is

459
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,120
how a lot of empirical statistics ends

460
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:22,280
up working. Um

461
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,280
can anyone suggest a better way? Yes.

462
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,520
All right. Uh, so let me let me rephrase

463
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,280
that. Um, so we know that every

464
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,200
friendship goes both ways. There's one

465
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,200
MIAT student and one Harvard student.

466
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,760
Again, we're assuming friendship is uh

467
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,360
is two-way, no unrequited friendships.

468
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,960
Um, can't the two schools just get

469
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,480
along?

470
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,039
Um, but because there are the same

471
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,559
number of friendships on both sides, um,

472
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,000
when we're taking the average, we're

473
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,520
dividing by the number of Harvard

474
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,919
students and dividing by the number of

475
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,080
MIT students. But Harvard has more

476
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,480
undergrads than MIT, so we've divided by

477
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,440
a bigger number. So, the MIT average

478
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,440
should be bigger. Woo, that was a lot.

479
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,320
Um, thank you for saying all that. Let's

480
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,559
unpack it a little more slowly. Um, but

481
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,159
you are absolutely correct in every step

482
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:22,039
of your reasoning. Um, so what I'm going

483
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,039
to do is let's draw a graph

484
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:29,600
where the vertices are going to equal um

485
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,919
the set of MIT undergrads and the set of

486
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,000
Harvard undergrads.

487
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,840
Um, and I want to emphasize that these

488
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,159
are two disjoint sets. No student is

489
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,679
enrolled in both schools. Um, we're not

490
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,840
counting cross registration. That's why

491
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,400
I mentioned that earlier. uh and

492
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,559
sometimes to emphasize that these two

493
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,440
sets are disjoint sometimes you put a

494
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,919
little dot inside the union sign. So our

495
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,520
set of vertices is the disjoint union of

496
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:58,400
MIT students and Harvard students. And

497
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:03,200
um our edge set is going to be the set

498
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,919
of let's see M comma H where M is an MIT

499
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,720
student, H is a Harvard student and M

500
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,720
and H are friends.

501
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,000
And we can draw an example of what this

502
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,840
might look like. So here's all of my

503
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,559
Harvard vertices on the left. Here's all

504
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,919
of my MIT students on the right. Um here

505
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,960
we have like I don't know Bill and Helen

506
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:29,360
and Natalie

507
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:34,080
and Neil and TS on the right. Maybe we

508
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:36,320
have uh Buzz and Kenji

509
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,440
and Lisa.

510
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,799
And these lists go on. Um, this is just

511
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,120
an example. I don't know if they're

512
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,720
actually students with these names. Um,

513
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,720
and some pairs of them are friends.

514
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,080
Maybe these are friends. And these and

515
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,559
these are friends. And Buzz is just

516
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,880
friends with most people. And TS only

517
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,039
likes Lisa among this graph. Some pairs

518
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,400
of them are friends. Here's our graph.

519
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,480
Again, there are more vertices, more

520
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,880
edges, but here's an example of our

521
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,200
graph. And this graph has a special

522
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,600
property called bipartite. This is a

523
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,480
bipartite graph.

524
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,480
Um let's see definition

525
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:17,440
um G is

526
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:22,440
bipartite

527
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,440
um when it's possible

528
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,600
to partition V as the disjoints disjoint

529
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,279
union of two sets. I'm going to call

530
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,960
them left and right. That's common

531
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:40,760
notation for for bipartite graphs. um

532
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,760
such that every edge

533
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:50,640
has one end point

534
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:52,159
in L and one end point in R.

535
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,840
So you have some vertices on the left,

536
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,080
some vertices on the right, and every

537
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,679
edge crosses between them. One end point

538
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,360
on the left, one end point on the right.

539
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,520
These graphs are called bipartite, and

540
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,279
the one we just drew certainly has that

541
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,960
property.

542
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:11,120
Sound good with me so far? Awesome.

543
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,600
And now um we have a bipartite version

544
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,919
of the handshake lema.

545
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,919
Let's see.

546
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,799
handshake lema

547
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,799
bipartite

548
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,240
which says that if you add up all the

549
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,240
degrees just on the left

550
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,279
the vertices in the left side degree of

551
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,200
v.

552
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,039
Well, every edge has one endpoint on the

553
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,400
left and one end point on the right. So

554
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,640
this is just equal to the number of

555
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,400
edges.

556
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,120
And likewise you can do the same thing

557
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,120
on the right.

558
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,600
So all the degrees on the left add to

559
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,880
the number of edges. All the degrees on

560
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,039
the right add to the number of edges.

561
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,679
But remember we are interested in the

562
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:07,919
averages. The average degree on the left

563
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,679
versus the average degree on the right.

564
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,600
All right.

565
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:17,039
So, we've got, let's say, average degree

566
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,600
on the MIT side

567
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:23,520
divided by the

568
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:26,640
average degree on the Harvard side.

569
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,120
Well, this is equal to the

570
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,400
total degree on the MIT side. So, just

571
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,000
adding up all the degrees um of the MIT

572
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,080
students

573
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,120
divided by

574
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,360
the number of MIT students.

575
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,159
And this denominator

576
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,279
is the total

577
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,840
degree on the Harvard side divided by uh

578
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,520
the number of Harvard students.

579
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,120
Right? That's what we mean by average.

580
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,000
Add them up, divide by the number. Add

581
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,600
them up, divide by the number. Okay? But

582
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,440
we just said that the total degree on

583
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,080
the Mside and the total degree on the H

584
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,240
side, both of those are equal to just

585
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,720
the number of edges.

586
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,200
So this is the number of edges divided

587
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,919
by the size of M.

588
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,640
divided by the number of edges divided

589
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,640
by the size of h.

590
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,440
The e cancel. This just becomes the size

591
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,880
of h divided by the size of m.

592
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,080
All right, we've now caught up to your

593
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,559
comment. Thank you so much. Um, and now

594
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,120
we can just ask how many students there

595
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,440
are in each school. Um, this is about,

596
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:40,559
let's see, I wrote something down. About

597
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,159
7,200 divided by 4600.

598
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,080
Those are close anyway. They might be a

599
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,720
bit out of date. Um, but this is about

600
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,440
1.6.

601
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,880
So, the average MIT student has about

602
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,440
1.6 times more Harvard students, Harvard

603
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,000
friends, uh, than the number of MIT

604
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:05,200
friends the average Harvard student has.

605
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,120
And that's not um any judgment about

606
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,559
behavior on the two sides of the

607
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,080
schools. It's just a fact about averages

608
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,600
uh after knowing a little bit of graph

609
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,600
theory.

610
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Um but our number is bigger so we're

611
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,600
better.

612
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,559
Um, but

613
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,240
so already

614
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,399
we've just defined a couple things and

615
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,520
we've already been able to prove some

616
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,799
non-obvious theorems and facts. Um,

617
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,360
again, they still look like toy

618
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,240
examples, but there are real scientific

619
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,840
studies that have studied questions like

620
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,399
that and not known the graph theory and

621
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,399
then came up with conclusions that were

622
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,440
very obviously wrong to anyone who did

623
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:52,240
know the graph theory. Um for example uh

624
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,480
there's a very famous study um out of

625
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Chicago from 1994

626
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,360
uh called the social organization of

627
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:03,120
sexuality sexual practices in the US. Uh

628
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,440
so it was a big sweeping um study about

629
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,399
sexual practices and behavior and health

630
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,159
across the country. Um they had

631
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,640
thousands of participants. They asked

632
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,200
lots and lots of questions and came up

633
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,039
with lots of statistics and measurements

634
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,240
and trends and published all their

635
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,200
results in a big 700page writeup, a very

636
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,320
famous study. Um, and out of all the

637
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,679
questions they asked, I'm going to

638
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,799
single out one of one of them uh for the

639
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,440
single purpose that their results are

640
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:36,240
obviously wrong because of exactly this

641
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,559
argument. So, one question they asked um

642
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,760
specifically to their male and female

643
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,760
participants um they asked the men um

644
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,120
how many female partners they've had.

645
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,679
They asked the women how many male

646
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,440
partners they've had. Um don't worry,

647
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,840
they had lots of other questions about

648
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,440
other kinds of relationships. Uh they

649
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,520
had lots of other questions for their

650
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,520
non-binary participants as well. Like I

651
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,039
said, I'm just singling out this one of

652
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:03,279
many questions. Um so, what's the

653
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,279
average number of female partners a man

654
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,480
has had? what's the average number of

655
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:12,000
male partners a woman has had. Um, and

656
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,520
according to their reports and surveys,

657
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:21,159
um, the men reported about 1.74 times as

658
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,159
many partners as the women. Um,

659
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:36,240
let's see. So the average

660
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:40,159
degree of the men

661
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:45,840
um was equal to about 1.74

662
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:48,320
times the average degree of the women.

663
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,960
Um, a different study, this time from

664
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,320
ABC News in 2004,

665
00:31:50,960 --> 00:32:00,440
um, got a similar result, but instead of

666
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:00,440
1.74, so sorry, this was from Chicago,

667
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,880
um, ABC News

668
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,640
approximated this number to be about

669
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,880
3.3.

670
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,720
Um, yet another study from the National

671
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,679
Center of Health, National

672
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,399
Center of Health

673
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,799
this time from 2007 got this number to

674
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,799
be about 1.75

675
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,440
when of course we know the exact answer.

676
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,840
This ratio should be the number of women

677
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,679
divided by the number of men. Because of

678
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,480
the specific question they were asking

679
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,039
about this subset of relationships among

680
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,679
this subset of the population. They put

681
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,279
themselves in a bipartite scenario where

682
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,799
this theorem applies and the correct

683
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,760
answer is just the number of women

684
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,760
divided by the number of men.

685
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,919
The uh let's see the number of women

686
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:01,600
divided by the number of men which um

687
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:07,279
according to the 2010 census was about

688
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:10,720
157 million over 152 million

689
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:14,320
which is about 1.03. 03.

690
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,360
The correct answer is 1.03.

691
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:20,000
And it's not a question of behavior.

692
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,240
It's a question of just averages.

693
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Uh there is nothing to learn from this

694
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,720
ratio except this is how many men and

695
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,399
women are in the country. Not a very

696
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,159
interesting example for a behavioral

697
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:35,120
study if you ask me. Um I'm not going to

698
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,320
speculate on why these numbers don't

699
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,600
match reality. Um,

700
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,919
I don't know. Think about it yourselves

701
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,279
if you want.

702
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,279
Uh, are there questions about this

703
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,279
example

704
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,360
or anything else we've talked about so

705
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,360
far?

706
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,799
All right, let's move on to another

707
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,799
topic in graph theory, another common

708
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,799
application.

709
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,960
[Applause]

710
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,079
So instead of measuring affinities or

711
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,760
friendships among pairs of objects,

712
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,760
let's measure conflicts between them.

713
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,800
So here's an example graph.

714
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,560
Let's say

715
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,240
let's define the vertex set of our graph

716
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,359
to be the set of all

717
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,119
MIT classes

718
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,520
with

719
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,800
a final exam

720
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,800
and E is going to be pairs of classes.

721
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,800
is

722
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,480
C1 C2

723
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,400
that have someone

724
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,720
enrolled

725
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,720
in both.

726
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,200
So you're the registar. Your goal is to

727
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,119
assign a time for the final exam for

728
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,440
every class.

729
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,760
And if some student is taking two

730
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,760
different classes and those classes are

731
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,839
scheduled for the same time slot or

732
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,760
overlapping time slots, then that

733
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,359
student can't be in the same place at uh

734
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,400
can't be in two different places at the

735
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,880
same time. So you have a conflict. So

736
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,800
this graph here is measuring all of the

737
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,040
conflicts among uh final exam times.

738
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,280
There's an edge precisely when the two

739
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,440
classes can't be scheduled for

740
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,079
overlapping times.

741
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,079
Does that make sense so far? Cool. So,

742
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,079
edges

743
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,760
are conflicts

744
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,640
in exam scheduling.

745
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,720
And let me draw an example.

746
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,200
Let's see.

747
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,200
So in this example, MIT only has five

748
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:21,560
courses.

749
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,560
Um six um 3700, 6,000,

750
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,920
6200,

751
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,240
6 3,000,

752
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,200
and 64,100.

753
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,280
So this is some fake approximation of

754
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,200
what this graph might look like. So,

755
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,560
this says that there's someone taking

756
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,480
our class and 62000.

757
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,839
Um, there's some people there's at least

758
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,599
one student taking both of these

759
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:49,440
classes. There's no one taking uh 6 3700

760
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,680
and 63000.

761
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,119
Um, so for example, these two are

762
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,880
allowed to be scheduled at the same

763
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,800
time.

764
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,960
Um, so this is listing all of our

765
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,520
conflicts.

766
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,520
And this brings us to the graph coloring

767
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,520
problem.

768
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,340
[Applause]

769
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:34,320
Uh, so we say that a

770
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:44,359
proper K coloring

771
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,359
a proper K coloring of a graph G

772
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,960
uh is defined to be

773
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,520
I'll write it down mathematically first

774
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,599
and then explain it in words. a function

775
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,520
f from the set of vertices to a set c of

776
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,520
colors

777
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,520
um

778
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,000
where there are at most k colors

779
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,240
and for all edges

780
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,119
uv

781
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,640
fu does not equal

782
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,480
fv.

783
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,440
So in other words, we have some set of

784
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,240
colors available and we want to assign a

785
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,079
color to every vertex.

786
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,960
Um, and we want to assign a color to

787
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,560
every vertex so that no two adjacent

788
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,480
vertices are ever assigned the same

789
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,400
color.

790
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,320
In this example, you can think of colors

791
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,839
as time slots for final exams.

792
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,040
If two vertices are given the same

793
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,760
color, that means that they'll be

794
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,440
administered at the same time. And this

795
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,280
condition that edges have to have two

796
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,040
different colors on their endpoints

797
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,680
means that anytime there's a scheduling

798
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,200
conflict, they will always be given

799
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,320
different colors, which means they'll be

800
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,240
given different time slots.

801
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,000
So this is what we mean by a proper K

802
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,839
coloring. It's an assignment of um of a

803
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,320
color to every vertex from a possible

804
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,079
choice of K different colors where the

805
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,800
two end points of every edge are

806
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,800
assigned different colors.

807
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,560
Uh, and as an example,

808
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,599
so let's let's try to color this graph.

809
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,920
Um, okay. I'm going to color

810
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,359
let's say I'm going to color this red

811
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:33,359
and this green and this blue and this

812
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:36,359
yellow and this purple. Is that a proper

813
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,359
coloring?

814
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,760
Yeah. Yeah. Every edge has two different

815
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,839
colors on its end points because all the

816
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,160
colors are distinct. This is a proper

817
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:50,599
five coloring.

818
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,599
Can be five colored.

819
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,359
All right. But that means we need five

820
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,800
different time slots for the final exams

821
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:01,040
and we'd like to be a little more

822
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,520
efficient. Uh can we color this with

823
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,520
just four colors?

824
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,200
Yes, I claim we can. Let's make that red

825
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,440
instead of purple.

826
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,040
Now, this class and this class are both

827
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,480
red,

828
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,240
but because there's no edge between

829
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,920
them, uh, that's fine. All of the edges

830
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,240
have two different colors on their end

831
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:27,400
points, and that's all we need. All

832
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,400
right, so this can be fourcolored.

833
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:35,240
Can we do better?

834
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,240
Can we get away with just three colors?

835
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,480
All right. Interesting. I'm seeing one

836
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,760
headshake and and one head nod. Um, so

837
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,119
yes, please.

838
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,760
How about making the yellow?

839
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,760
Make yellow red.

840
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,320
Okay, we'll make this blue or green.

841
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,720
Yeah. All right. So, we've got red,

842
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,880
green, blue, red, blue. So, we've got

843
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,040
two reds, but there's no edge between

844
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,040
them, so we're fine. And we've got two

845
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,839
blues, but there's no edge between them,

846
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:09,119
so we're fine. This is absolutely a

847
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:09,119
valid threec coloring.

848
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,920
can be three-colored.

849
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,560
Can this be 17 colored?

850
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,280
Is there a proper 17 coloring for this

851
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:28,480
graph? This is a bit of a weird edge

852
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:31,359
case, but yes. Um, this set C um says

853
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,119
that there have to be at most 17 colors

854
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,560
available.

855
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,240
We don't have to use all of those

856
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,680
colors.

857
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,680
Um so if we were if we had a 17 color

858
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,839
palette and we found this proper

859
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,680
coloring that would be a be considered a

860
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:50,079
valid 17 coloring. So this is a valid uh

861
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,040
this is a proper 17 coloring of the

862
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,319
graph but more directly it's a proper

863
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,440
three coloring because usually we're

864
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:59,599
trying to minimize the number of colors.

865
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,599
All right. And we can make that notion

866
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,599
concrete

867
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,880
definition. Uh the chromatic

868
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,160
number

869
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,240
of a graph G. The chromatic number is

870
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,800
denoted

871
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,800
kai of G. That's a lowercase Greek. Kai

872
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,319
is the smallest

873
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,440
number of colors

874
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,880
needed

875
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,880
for a proper

876
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:48,079
coloring of G.

877
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,760
All right.

878
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:52,800
So, the chromatic number asks, what's

879
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,400
the fewest colors you can get away with?

880
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,400
Um, in our scheduling problem, what's

881
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,440
the fewest number of time slots that we

882
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,040
need to cover all of the final exams?

883
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,319
Um, for this graph, what is its

884
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,560
chromatic number? Have we shown that

885
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,560
it's three?

886
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,280
First of all, is it five?

887
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,319
Is the chromatic number of this graph

888
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,319
five? Why not?

889
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,920
because we can we can get away with

890
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:26,319
fewer colors. That's right. It's not

891
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,079
five because we can do fewer. Uh it's

892
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,079
not four because we can do fewer. Is it

893
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,079
three?

894
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,760
I don't know yet. Can we get away with

895
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,760
fewer colors?

896
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,400
Well, let's see.

897
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,319
Um can it be two-colored? Is there a

898
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,560
proper coloring with just two colors for

899
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,560
this graph?

900
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,839
And in this case, there isn't because

901
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,520
this triangle right here shows us that

902
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,839
all three of these vertices need

903
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,520
different colors.

904
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,520
Uh you can think of this as a proof by

905
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,319
contradiction as well. Assume it's

906
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:05,359
possible to color with just two colors.

907
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:07,280
Well then, well, these three vertices

908
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:10,160
would have a conflict among them

909
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,640
somehow, which is a contradiction.

910
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,640
Um so

911
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,440
cannot

912
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,440
be two-colored

913
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,440
and these two statements together can be

914
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,240
colored with three colors cannot be

915
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,680
colored with two colors. This is what we

916
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,400
need to confirm that the chromatic

917
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,160
number is three. Three is the smallest

918
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,240
because three works and fewer doesn't

919
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,920
work.

920
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,920
uh and I want to emphasize that in

921
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,920
general

922
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,079
to show that the chromatic number of G

923
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,319
is some value K

924
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:52,119
um usually we need both an upper bound

925
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,119
and a lower bound.

926
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,440
We need an upper bound

927
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:03,920
which is that K of G is less equal K.

928
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:07,040
And how do we prove that?

929
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,359
usually by giving a K coloring. If you

930
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,440
know it's possible to color in K colors,

931
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,440
then the chromatic number has to be K or

932
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,440
smaller.

933
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,839
Give a K coloring.

934
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,400
But you also need a lower bound

935
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,480
that K of G has to be greater than K

936
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,200
minus one.

937
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,560
And how do you prove that?

938
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,440
You prove you have to prove that it

939
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:40,720
can't

940
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:44,280
be kus one colored

941
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,280
usually by contradiction.

942
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,839
So I just wanted to emphasize that the

943
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,079
definition of chromatic number as the

944
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:58,880
smallest thing that works there are two

945
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:02,800
parts to that. It works and nothing

946
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:05,440
smaller works. Make sense?

947
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,079
Cool.

948
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,160
All right.

949
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:14,079
So,

950
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,599
let me Yes.

951
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,480
So, graph coloring. We've seen one

952
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:22,000
application which is the registar

953
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,240
scheduling final exams. They actually do

954
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,240
something exactly like this. By the way,

955
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,920
this is why uh final exam schedules

956
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,920
don't come out till a couple weeks into

957
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,079
the semester because they need to see

958
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:35,200
who's enrolled in which pairs of classes

959
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,720
so we can try to schedule those um apart

960
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,319
from each other. They're trying to find

961
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,000
a coloring with few colors. Um in

962
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,000
practice, if they were looking for an

963
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,599
actual proper coloring with no conflicts

964
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
whatsoever,

965
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,599
probably wouldn't fit into exam week. So

966
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,839
instead they're looking to minimize the

967
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,200
number of conflicts which is a slightly

968
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,599
different problem but still an

969
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,720
interesting one.

970
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:02,000
But there are lots of scenarios where

971
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,680
you're trying to avoid conflicts

972
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,400
um just like the registar is trying to

973
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,800
avoid conflicts.

974
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,800
So other

975
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,720
coloring applications,

976
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,319
um, a really common one and one that's

977
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:24,760
appropriate for this computer science

978
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,760
class is register allocation.

979
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:32,880
When designing compilers,

980
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,800
um, you have multiple values that you're

981
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:39,400
trying to compute, different operations

982
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,400
you need to do with them. Yes,

983
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,480
matters,

984
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:51,119
that's a great question. Thank you for

985
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:53,359
asking. Um, do the elements of C matter

986
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,640
or just the size of C? C is the set of

987
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:58,720
colors available. Um, so if you change

988
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,160
the set C, then you're you're giving a

989
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,440
different coloring because your colors

990
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,520
mean different things. Um, but you're

991
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,960
not going to change how many colors are

992
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,560
needed. You're not going to change the

993
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,920
chromatic number if you change the set

994
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:14,000
of colors available. Um,

995
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,599
and you you said we could have put like

996
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,839
green green here instead of here.

997
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:22,559
Yeah. Like we could have made the reds

998
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:24,480
could in could instead be green and this

999
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:26,400
green could be red or this green could

1000
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,000
be yellow.

1001
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,319
Now we've got some greens, some blues,

1002
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,440
and a yellow. Still three colors,

1003
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:34,319
different coloring because we're

1004
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,160
assigning different colors to them, but

1005
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:37,760
um still the same number of colors. And

1006
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,839
often for the applications we're about

1007
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,480
to talk about, the number of colors is

1008
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:44,079
all that matters because the colors just

1009
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,000
mean these are the different classes

1010
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:48,800
that you need to put them in. and then

1011
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,359
you do something with each class.

1012
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,960
Um so this application register

1013
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,880
allocation when you're computing

1014
00:48:52,960 --> 00:49:00,400
multiple values um the your processor

1015
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,480
has a small number like 16 or 32

1016
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,720
registers which are really really fast

1017
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,400
memory that it can um that it can do

1018
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,280
operations on and in fact it has to

1019
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:13,839
bring data into a register before it can

1020
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:16,000
compute on them usually. Um, and

1021
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,760
some values you're computing and you

1022
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,359
need lots of different pieces to go into

1023
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,480
that computation. Some values, well,

1024
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,640
you're done with it. You don't need to

1025
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,920
remember it anymore. So, let's evict

1026
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,119
that and put something else in that

1027
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:29,359
register. And ideally, you can figure

1028
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,520
out a way to schedule all of your values

1029
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:33,040
in the different registers so that

1030
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,720
everything fits in the registers and

1031
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,359
everything's fast instead of having to

1032
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:40,720
spill them out into RAM. um you don't

1033
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:43,520
need to understand compilers or exactly

1034
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,880
what I'm saying here. The point is um

1035
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,200
your variables, the values you're

1036
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,960
computing have different lifetimes.

1037
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,160
Times when they need to still exist and

1038
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:56,160
other times when you're allowed to

1039
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:59,200
forget them. Um and compiler writers

1040
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,599
often draw exactly the conflict graph

1041
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,200
between these lifetimes. This value has

1042
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,599
to exist at the same time that this

1043
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,000
value also has to exist. So they can't

1044
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,839
be in the same register

1045
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,160
um because then one would overwrite the

1046
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:14,160
other. And if you can write down your

1047
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:16,880
conflict graph and find a coloring with

1048
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,319
a small number of colors um ideally

1049
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,079
smaller than the number of registers

1050
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,800
available then everything works in

1051
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:26,880
registers and you're really fast.

1052
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:31,400
Um another one is

1053
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,400
radio tower frequencies.

1054
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,960
Um, if each if each tower in a radio

1055
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,079
network needs to broadcast with some

1056
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,920
frequencies, well, if two towers use the

1057
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,000
same frequency that can reach the same

1058
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,280
places, then they're going to conflict.

1059
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,480
You're going to get static in the noise.

1060
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,200
You're getting noise from two different

1061
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:52,720
places at once. Um, so any conflicting

1062
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,040
towers need to use different

1063
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:58,000
frequencies. And this is again a graph

1064
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:00,000
coloring problem. Um, draw your your

1065
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,920
conflict graph, color it with a small

1066
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,160
number of colors. each color is a

1067
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,640
different frequency. And since different

1068
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,160
towers that are assigned the same color

1069
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:09,680
don't have an edge in the conflict

1070
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,040
graph, it means they don't conflict. And

1071
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,680
so they're allowed to use the same

1072
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,440
frequency just fine.

1073
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,880
Um,

1074
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:22,160
in general, where did I put this list?

1075
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:27,079
Way over here. No, come back.

1076
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,079
Um, let's see. Map coloring.

1077
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,880
Uh a while ago, Eric told us about the

1078
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:37,680
four color theorem that every planer map

1079
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,319
uh every map that you draw uh on a sheet

1080
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,160
of paper, you can color all the regions

1081
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,839
in different colors so that two

1082
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,319
neighboring regions never have the same

1083
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:48,160
color. Uh and four colors is always

1084
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,240
enough.

1085
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,720
Excuse me. Um this is just saying that

1086
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,440
certain kinds of graphs can always be

1087
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,920
fourcolored. Not every graph but certain

1088
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,480
kinds of graphs um the so-called planer

1089
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,240
graphs can always be fourcolored.

1090
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,400
Um

1091
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,319
this is this is the language that that

1092
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,839
proof is written in. It's it's a theorem

1093
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:10,800
about graph theory. It uses graph

1094
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:12,880
theory. Um

1095
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,760
but it's an example we've already seen

1096
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,559
which is nice in general. Anytime you're

1097
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,119
trying to avoid

1098
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:24,119
pairwise

1099
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,119
conflicts,

1100
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,480
graph coloring is a great tool to reach

1101
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,079
for

1102
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:32,880
because it's such a great tool to reach

1103
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:36,480
for in many contexts. Wouldn't it be

1104
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,800
great if there was a really fast, simple

1105
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:40,880
algorithm that says, "Here's a graph.

1106
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,559
Here's a target number of colors. Please

1107
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,200
give me a coloring, a proper coloring

1108
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:48,319
that uses this number of colors.

1109
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:51,760
Um so an algorithm

1110
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:56,520
to k color

1111
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,520
any input graph

1112
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:04,040
um or decide

1113
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,040
it's not possible

1114
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,040
if I'm the registar and I know I have

1115
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,720
what is it five days of exams two

1116
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,119
sessions each so I have 10 different

1117
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,599
exam sessions I really want a 10

1118
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,119
coloring of my graph

1119
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,280
Um

1120
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,960
and so I want to ask please give me a 10

1121
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,119
coloring of this conflict graph and then

1122
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:27,920
that's my schedule. Is there an

1123
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:30,720
algorithm to do that? Um likewise

1124
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:35,839
uh instead of asking give me 10 colors

1125
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:39,040
um you can ask algorithm to compute

1126
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:40,559
k of g. I don't know in advance how many

1127
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,160
colors I'm expecting. Just give me the

1128
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,240
best coloring. Give me a coloring that

1129
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,160
uses the fewest number of colors. Is

1130
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,520
there an algorithm to do that? That

1131
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,240
would be really great in lots of

1132
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,839
applications. Um, unfortunately, I'm

1133
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,800
talking in hypotheticals here because

1134
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:59,720
these algorithms very very likely don't

1135
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,720
exist. Uh, these problems

1136
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,359
are what we call NP

1137
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:12,280
well this problem's nplete. This one's

1138
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:12,280
possibly even harder. Um,

1139
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,240
at least this problem is npmplete. Like

1140
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:21,599
I said, this one might be even harder

1141
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,599
than NP. Um, what does this mean? I

1142
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,680
don't care so much. Uh, I don't really

1143
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:28,240
want to dig into what NPMPlete means

1144
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:30,880
right now or NP hard or any of those

1145
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,200
things. What I will say is that there

1146
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,520
are thousands upon thousands of

1147
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,119
computational problems like graph

1148
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,160
coloring

1149
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:41,599
um like the traveling salesman problem

1150
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:46,559
if you've heard of that one it's pretty

1151
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:49,520
famous um like sudoku on n squ by n

1152
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:51,119
squared boards instead of just 9 by9 um

1153
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,160
there are thousands upon thousands of

1154
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:58,240
these problems that computer scientists

1155
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:00,559
have decided are all equally difficult

1156
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:03,040
So if we were able to find an efficient

1157
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,599
algorithm to solve any one of them like

1158
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,880
to solve the k coloring problem then

1159
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,880
that would immediately give us an

1160
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,680
algorithm to solve all the other ones

1161
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,040
efficiently as well. Uh and all the

1162
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:17,599
problems that are easier than those. Um

1163
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:21,400
a notable problem that we've already

1164
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,400
talked about is factoring

1165
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:29,119
large numbers.

1166
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,119
This is known to be in NP. It's not

1167
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,440
known whether it's NP complete. It's in

1168
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,200
fact thought to be even easier than than

1169
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:39,280
most of these. So it's thought that

1170
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:43,359
factoring numbers is somehow easier than

1171
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,800
K coloring your graph. Also, by the way,

1172
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,880
even if we're just asking for three

1173
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,119
colors, does this graph have a coloring

1174
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,480
with just three colors? That's already

1175
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,599
nplete. That's already too hard. and we

1176
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,520
don't believe there's going to be an

1177
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:59,359
efficient algorithm for it. Um, so if

1178
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,200
you solve this easier problem, factoring

1179
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:03,599
large numbers, if you find an efficient

1180
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,160
algorithm for that, well, you'll be able

1181
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:08,079
to break all the public RSA keys, uh,

1182
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,960
read everyone's encrypted messages,

1183
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,559
steal all the electronic money, um,

1184
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,920
including the real currency from

1185
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:17,680
electronic banks, um, run from all of

1186
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,480
the world governments that are trying to

1187
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:22,640
hire and/or silence you.

1188
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,480
Um,

1189
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:27,280
but if you solve the even harder problem

1190
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:30,000
of threecoloring a graph, you get all

1191
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,799
that plus a million-doll prize for

1192
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,000
solving a famous millennium problem. So,

1193
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:37,760
you've got choices.

1194
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,799
Point is

1195
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,839
graph coloring is a hard computational

1196
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:45,200
problem and we strongly believe most

1197
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:47,920
computer scientists strongly believe

1198
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:51,520
that there is no efficient algorithm um

1199
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,599
for graph coloring and so we're not it's

1200
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:57,520
not realistic at least for very large

1201
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:59,280
graphs. It's not realistic to ask for um

1202
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,599
a coloring with a specific number of

1203
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,920
colors or the the best possible

1204
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,760
coloring,

1205
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,680
which means that our applications are a

1206
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,920
little bit sad because sometimes we

1207
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:13,119
really want optimal colorings.

1208
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:15,440
Thankfully, in practice, um optimal

1209
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,200
colorings aren't really necessary.

1210
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,880
Sometimes we can get away with good

1211
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,880
enough.

1212
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:25,359
Um, and so for all of these NP complete

1213
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,880
or NP hard problems, the best you can

1214
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:30,160
hope for is an algorithm that's good

1215
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:33,280
enough. Um, usually the answer it gives

1216
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:35,520
is a little worse, but it runs faster.

1217
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,400
Uh, and let's let's see an algorithm for

1218
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,319
that to give us some colorings of

1219
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,880
graphs, even if they're not always

1220
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,880
optimal colorings.

1221
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,599
All right.

1222
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:04,040
So we have a greedy

1223
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,040
coloring

1224
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,760
algorithm.

1225
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:12,640
Um and here is the idea of the

1226
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,400
algorithm. So first of all, um we're

1227
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,359
going to

1228
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:20,079
order the vertices

1229
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:21,920
v1, v2

1230
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,559
vn. So we're going to pick some ordering

1231
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:28,920
of the vertices.

1232
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,920
Uh we're going to order the colors.

1233
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,160
Uh I'm going to use my favorite color

1234
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,559
palette. One, two, three, and so on.

1235
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:40,680
Those are my colors.

1236
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,680
Um and then

1237
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:47,200
for each vi in order

1238
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:49,040
so we'll look at v1 then v2 then v3 and

1239
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,599
so on and we'll assign each of them a

1240
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:54,240
color one at a time.

1241
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:58,680
Um,

1242
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,680
assign vi the smallest

1243
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,880
color

1244
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,280
that doesn't introduce conflicts.

1245
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:18,160
So when we get to vertex I, we're going

1246
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,480
to ask, does color one work? Does color

1247
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:23,040
two work? Does color three work? And

1248
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:25,359
this the first time we get to a color

1249
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,280
that is valid that it doesn't have a

1250
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:28,960
neighbor of that same color, we're going

1251
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,359
to assign it that color and then move on

1252
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:34,079
to the next vertex.

1253
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,200
It's greedy because you're um yeah, it's

1254
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,960
called greedy because you're always

1255
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:39,839
picking the smallest color you can at

1256
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:41,359
any one time. It doesn't necessarily

1257
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:44,640
mean that you're going to get an optimal

1258
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:46,079
coloring. In fact, usually you won't. At

1259
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:49,359
least, you know, for big graphs where

1260
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:51,359
it's hard to find optimal colorings. Um,

1261
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:53,520
let's run through this algorithm. Let's

1262
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:58,880
see it happening just to get a more

1263
00:59:53,520 --> 01:00:01,520
concrete feel for what we mean. Um,

1264
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,319
here we go. So, here's my graph. Nope.

1265
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:07,040
Pause. Thank you. Six vertices. One,

1266
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:09,200
two, three, four, five, seven edges.

1267
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,720
Uh, and this is the vertex order we're

1268
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,040
going to use. We could choose any vertex

1269
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:15,520
order we want. Um, but we're going to

1270
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:17,280
look at the vertices in this order and

1271
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:20,079
always choose the smallest color that's

1272
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,440
valid. So the first one, first color is

1273
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,760
fine because there are no possible

1274
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,640
conflicts. No one else has colors yet.

1275
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,640
Uh second vertex, the first color is no

1276
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,319
good because it already has a color.

1277
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,520
Sorry, it already has a neighbor that's

1278
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:35,839
been assigned that color. So instead of

1279
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:38,799
the color triangle, we have to go up to

1280
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:41,440
color square.

1281
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:44,799
All right. Now, let's go to vertex

1282
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:47,520
three. Our first color is valid this

1283
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:50,960
time, so it gets color one.

1284
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:52,960
Still with me? All right. Vertex four

1285
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,559
can't use color one, but can use color

1286
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,480
two.

1287
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:59,520
Vertex five, let's take a look. Uh,

1288
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,760
vertex 5 can't use the first color,

1289
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:03,920
can't use the second color, but can use

1290
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:07,280
the third color. So, it gets assigned

1291
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,040
the third color. And finally, vertex 6

1292
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:11,280
gets assigned the first color. And we

1293
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:13,520
have our valid coloring, our proper

1294
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:16,319
coloring. Does that algorithm make

1295
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:21,480
sense? Awesome.

1296
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:21,480
Um, one thing I want to mention is that

1297
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:25,640
different vertex orderings

1298
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,359
will often lead to

1299
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:33,960
different colorings

1300
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,920
and often lead to

1301
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:46,720
colorings with a different

1302
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:50,040
number

1303
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:50,040
of colors.

1304
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,000
So here with this ordering, we got a

1305
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,640
coloring with three colors. We got a

1306
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,520
proper three coloring. But if instead we

1307
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,960
use this coloring, sorry, this ordering

1308
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,920
where all I've done is change the order

1309
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:06,160
of vertices 1, five, and six. This is a

1310
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,799
different vertex order on the same

1311
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,960
graph. So let's run the algorithm again

1312
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:13,119
in this ordering and let's see what

1313
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,839
coloring it gives us. So first color is

1314
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,440
fine here. First color is fine here.

1315
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,960
This one needs the second color because

1316
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,880
it already has a neighbor with the first

1317
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,640
color. Stop me if I'm going too quickly.

1318
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,119
Um, the next one has neighbors with

1319
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:29,599
colors one and two, so it needs the

1320
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:32,559
third color.

1321
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:35,680
Um, the fifth vertex has a neighbor with

1322
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:38,000
color one, so it needs the second color.

1323
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:41,520
Uh and then finally, vertex six has a

1324
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,079
neighbor with color one and a neighbor

1325
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:46,240
with color two and a neighbor with color

1326
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:48,319
three. So it in fact needs a fourth

1327
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,079
color.

1328
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:52,720
So with this different vertex ordering

1329
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:55,760
on the same graph, it gave us a four

1330
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:58,640
coloring instead of a three-coloring.

1331
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:01,880
All right. So some orderings are better

1332
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,880
than others.

1333
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:16,480
Yeah.

1334
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:18,400
All right. Um, does this algorithm

1335
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:21,640
actually work? Does it always give a

1336
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,640
proper coloring?

1337
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:27,760
So, yes, in this case it does. Um, and

1338
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:29,440
an easy way to see that is that um, the

1339
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,920
way the algorithm is designed, it never

1340
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,559
introduces conflicts.

1341
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:37,119
um always after we've assigned the next

1342
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:39,119
vertex, we never have an edge that has

1343
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:41,039
two end points of the same color because

1344
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:44,079
that's kind of the point of the

1345
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:46,240
algorithm. So we never introduce a

1346
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:48,559
conflict on any edge. So when we get to

1347
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:49,680
the end, we haven't introduced any

1348
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,319
conflicts, so there aren't any

1349
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:54,960
conflicts. That's kind of a a state

1350
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:58,520
machine style proof of of that

1351
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,520
algorithm. Yes.

1352
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,920
Good question. If you try all the

1353
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:06,000
orderings and then take the best one,

1354
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:09,119
the best coloring you get, will that be

1355
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,799
optimal? Um, so there there are sort of

1356
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:16,160
two questions in there. Um, can you get

1357
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:18,000
all colorings from this algorithm?

1358
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,599
And the answer is no. You can't get all

1359
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,359
colorings from this algorithm. For

1360
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:24,000
example, colorings that never use color

1361
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:25,359
one, you can't get from this algorithm

1362
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,599
because you're always going to use color

1363
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:30,160
one on the first vertex.

1364
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:33,280
Um, but the other question, can you

1365
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:35,920
always get some coloring that uses the

1366
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:38,240
minimal number of colors? Even if you

1367
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:39,680
can't get all different colorings, can

1368
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:43,280
you at least get all different numbers

1369
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:44,880
of colors? And that answer is yes. Um,

1370
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,039
it takes a little bit of thought to

1371
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:51,039
prove, but the answer is yes. So if you

1372
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:54,079
do try all n factorial vertex orderings

1373
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:55,920
uh and take the minimum minimal coloring

1374
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,960
um you will in fact get the chromatic

1375
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,760
number but n factorial is a runtime that

1376
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:05,680
is not considered efficient for things

1377
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:07,599
like np and and np hardness. Um so that

1378
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:10,000
is absolutely an algorithm to compute

1379
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,400
chromatic number uh just not an

1380
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:16,720
efficient one.

1381
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:19,520
Uh yeah great question. Um

1382
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:22,480
let me let me prove one thing about this

1383
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:24,640
greedy algorithm. Um as we said it's not

1384
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,319
always going to give the the smallest

1385
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:28,720
coloring depending on what order you

1386
01:05:26,319 --> 01:05:30,880
pick.

1387
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:34,240
But we can prove something about the

1388
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:39,000
quality of colorings we get.

1389
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:39,000
And here is that theorem.

1390
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:48,599
Okay. So

1391
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:57,079
for all graphs G

1392
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:57,079
for all vertex orderings,

1393
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:09,920
excuse me. Um if

1394
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:12,960
the max degree of our graph is less

1395
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,319
equal d um by max degree here I mean

1396
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,039
look at the degrees of all the vertices

1397
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:20,240
and take the largest one. So the maximum

1398
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:23,359
of the degrees of the vertices.

1399
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:25,440
Um so if the max degree is at most d

1400
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:29,960
said differently if all vertices in the

1401
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,960
graph have degree at most d

1402
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:34,920
then the greedy algorithm

1403
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,640
returns a coloring a proper coloring

1404
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:53,559
with at most D + one colors.

1405
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:59,680
So if all the vertices of the graph have

1406
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:01,760
degree at most D, then the greedy

1407
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:04,760
algorithm will use at most D + one

1408
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,760
colors.

1409
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:11,359
Does the statement make sense?

1410
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:14,480
So in this example, all the degrees are

1411
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:16,000
three or less. So we're guaranteed to

1412
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,079
produce a coloring that uses at most

1413
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,839
four colors.

1414
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:21,599
Uh, and I want to emphasize this depends

1415
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:24,400
on the degrees of the vertices, not the

1416
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:26,799
number of vertices. If if this graph had

1417
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,119
thousands and thousands of vertices, but

1418
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:30,720
all the degrees were three or less, we

1419
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,799
would still get a coloring with at most

1420
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:35,920
four colors.

1421
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:38,720
All right, it's not necessarily optimal.

1422
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,400
In this graph, it wasn't optimal. Um, we

1423
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,960
found a three coloring, whereas this

1424
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,960
only promises a four coloring.

1425
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,200
Um, but at least it's some measure of

1426
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:50,240
quality of the results we get out of

1427
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:52,880
this greedy algorithm.

1428
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:55,920
Does the claim make sense? Wonderful.

1429
01:07:52,880 --> 01:08:00,680
Let's prove it.

1430
01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:00,680
All right, we're going to prove this

1431
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,280
by induction.

1432
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:10,400
But induction on what?

1433
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:12,720
Um, we might think, okay, well, there's

1434
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:16,000
there's a D in the theorem statement.

1435
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:18,960
So, what if we induct on D?

1436
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:21,040
Well, that means at some point, um, we

1437
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,520
know something about all graphs whose

1438
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:25,040
degrees are at most eight, and we need

1439
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:28,799
to prove something about all graphs

1440
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:30,560
whose degrees are at most nine.

1441
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:33,040
I don't really see how to get from one

1442
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,520
to the next. That doesn't seem easy to

1443
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:37,120
me, right?

1444
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,960
Grasp with the degree nine. look with

1445
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,600
max degree 9 look very different from

1446
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:43,040
graphs with with max degree 8. If you

1447
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,560
have a graph with max degree 9, there

1448
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:47,839
might be many many many vertices with

1449
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:49,440
degree 9. Um but to get anything useful

1450
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:51,199
out of our inductive hypothesis, we

1451
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:53,199
would need all degree all degrees to be

1452
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:54,480
eight or less. Like there there's a

1453
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:56,640
disconnect there. I don't know how to

1454
01:08:54,480 --> 01:09:04,839
make that proof work.

1455
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:04,839
Um so let's see. Induction on what?

1456
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:09,839
We just said induction on D maybe not

1457
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,759
such a good idea.

1458
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:14,480
Often when when proving a statement

1459
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:17,839
about graphs by induction.

1460
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:20,799
Um there are two common strategies to

1461
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:23,359
try. You can try inducting on the number

1462
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:25,359
of vertices or inducting on the number

1463
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,839
of edges. I'll explain what that means

1464
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:29,359
in just a second. Um but these are going

1465
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:31,279
to be your best friends. If you're

1466
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:33,759
trying to prove a thing about graphs by

1467
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:35,759
induction, first try proving it by

1468
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:37,440
induction on the number of vertices.

1469
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:40,080
Then try proving it by induction on the

1470
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:43,359
number of edges. If both of those don't

1471
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:45,199
work, I don't know, cry.

1472
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:49,120
That that's what I that's what I would

1473
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:50,960
do. Um, but let's try this strategy.

1474
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:53,040
Let's induct on the number of vertices

1475
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,199
in our graph. And here's what that

1476
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:59,360
means.

1477
01:09:55,199 --> 01:10:02,239
So we're going to let P of N

1478
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:05,640
be the statement that

1479
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,640
all graphs

1480
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:14,760
with n vertices.

1481
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:14,760
So all graphs with exactly n vertices

1482
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:21,920
and

1483
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:24,920
max degree at most d

1484
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,920
um

1485
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:35,000
result in at most d +1 colors

1486
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,000
from the greedy algorithm.

1487
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:43,120
So this is what we mean by we're

1488
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,880
inducting on the number of vertices

1489
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:47,360
because n the variable we're going to be

1490
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:50,159
inducting on is measuring the number of

1491
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:52,960
vertices of our graph.

1492
01:10:50,159 --> 01:10:55,520
So um if we think about induction as

1493
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,600
proving things one step at a time. We're

1494
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:00,239
going to first prove something about all

1495
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,159
graphs with one vertex, then all graphs

1496
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:04,080
with two vertices, then all graphs with

1497
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:06,800
three vertices, then all graphs with

1498
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:09,199
four vertices. This is fun. It's five,

1499
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:12,080
six, seven. We're going to build up one

1500
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:14,000
size at a time. Um, and that's how our

1501
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:17,600
that's how our induction is going to go.

1502
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,440
Um, all graphs with n vertices is the

1503
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,320
key phrase here that makes this

1504
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,600
inducting on the number of vertices. If

1505
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:25,120
you wanted to induct on the number of

1506
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:28,560
edges, you would say all graphs with n

1507
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:30,400
edges or something like that.

1508
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,679
All right, does this setup make sense?

1509
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:37,159
So, we've defined PN here.

1510
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:37,159
Our goal

1511
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,960
we want

1512
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:53,280
to prove

1513
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,040
for all n greater equal one p of n is

1514
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,280
true.

1515
01:11:55,040 --> 01:12:01,679
Yeah.

1516
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:04,320
So for any number of vertices,

1517
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:06,719
all graphs with that many vertices do

1518
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:09,360
the thing.

1519
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:12,960
So together all of these PNS starting at

1520
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:15,520
P1 and going upward include all finite

1521
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:18,320
graphs.

1522
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:20,480
Does that make sense?

1523
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,840
I failed to mention earlier, but most of

1524
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,840
the graphs we're talking about in this

1525
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,440
class are going to be finite. So if I

1526
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,120
don't specify, go ahead and assume it's

1527
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:29,520
finite.

1528
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,960
Um, so this will cover all of the finite

1529
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,400
graphs. So it'll cover all the graphs we

1530
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,080
care about and we'll end up proving our

1531
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:40,480
theorem. All right. So let's actually

1532
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:42,400
prove our theorem. Um, base case

1533
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,400
P of one.

1534
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,600
Well, if there's only one vertex, we

1535
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,280
know what the greedy coloring is going

1536
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:51,360
to do.

1537
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:53,760
Um, well, let's see. Max

1538
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:56,080
degree is zero because there are no

1539
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:59,480
edges if there's only one vertex.

1540
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,480
Greedy coloring

1541
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:09,520
uses one color.

1542
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:12,320
One is 0 + 1 which is what was promised.

1543
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:14,800
So P of 1 is fine. Let's do the

1544
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:19,320
inductive step.

1545
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:19,320
P of N. So here assume

1546
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:24,960
P of N

1547
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:27,600
want to show P of N plus one. And I

1548
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:31,040
really want to emphasize one point right

1549
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:33,679
here. Um, very often in this class,

1550
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:36,480
students come away from uh the next

1551
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:39,920
couple lectures with the belief that

1552
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:42,080
induction on graphs is different. It

1553
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,000
follows different rules. It's backwards.

1554
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:47,120
We're going from n plus1 to n or

1555
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,199
something like that. Um, and I I really

1556
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,199
want to emphasize induction on graphs is

1557
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:53,199
using regular induction in the way we're

1558
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:56,800
used to that. We're not changing the

1559
01:13:53,199 --> 01:14:00,159
rules here. Um, what changes

1560
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:02,400
is that what it means to prove P of N

1561
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:04,239
implies P of N plus one is a little

1562
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,159
different from what we're used to. We're

1563
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:07,840
still proving that P of N implies P of N

1564
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:12,159
plus one because that's what induction

1565
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:13,679
tells us to do. But if we use our proof

1566
01:14:12,159 --> 01:14:15,760
outlining techniques from the first

1567
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:18,640
couple lectures and really unpack what

1568
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:20,719
it means to prove that this implies that

1569
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,560
what it tells you to do is often a

1570
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,560
little bit different from what your

1571
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:29,440
intuition might tell you you're supposed

1572
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:32,719
to do. So um it's doubly important when

1573
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:35,040
inducting on graphs to lean heavily on

1574
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:36,400
our proof outlining skills. to make sure

1575
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:38,560
that we're setting up our proof

1576
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:41,440
correctly to prove PN implies PN plus

1577
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:44,960
one and not something that we just think

1578
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:47,120
means PN implies PN plus1. Uh so let's

1579
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:50,640
do that. Now we're assuming P of N. In

1580
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:52,400
other words, we're assuming

1581
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,360
all

1582
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:58,360
uh let's see, nvertex

1583
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,360
graphs

1584
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:05,120
with

1585
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:07,600
min degree at most D produce at most D+1

1586
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:09,760
colors.

1587
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:15,040
Right? That's that's P of N. We're

1588
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:20,400
assuming P of N. And we want to show

1589
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:23,400
we want to show that all n + one vertex

1590
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,400
graphs

1591
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:32,640
with min degree at most d produce at

1592
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:34,320
most d plus1 colors.

1593
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:37,040
All I've done is write out what pn and

1594
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:38,640
pn plus1 mean in context. With me so

1595
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,560
far?

1596
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:42,159
All right. And here's where the the

1597
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:46,400
confusing bit happens or at least the

1598
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:48,640
non-intuitive bit. Um, our task is we

1599
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:52,640
want to prove that all n plus1 vertex

1600
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:56,000
graphs do some stuff. So the theorem

1601
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:59,120
we're trying to prove is a for all. All

1602
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,760
n plus1 vertex graphs do something.

1603
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:04,320
But we know how to prove a forall. We

1604
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,920
start with a generic thing in that set

1605
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:08,000
and we prove the conclusion for that

1606
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:10,560
thing.

1607
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,080
So this for all immediately tells us

1608
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:16,040
that the next line of our proof should

1609
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,040
probably look something like this.

1610
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:20,040
Suppose G

1611
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:24,760
is an arbitrary

1612
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:32,360
N +1

1613
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:32,360
vertex to graph.

1614
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:39,440
Yes.

1615
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:42,640
writing out the meanings of PN. Did you

1616
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:44,480
mean to say max degree?

1617
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,640
Absolutely. I meant to say max degree

1618
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:49,760
instead of min degree. That is a typo.

1619
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:51,520
Thank you so much. I guess it's a rhto

1620
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:55,719
because I'm not typing

1621
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,719
for both. Yes. Thank you.

1622
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:02,239
Thank you for catching that. All right.

1623
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,040
Is everyone okay with the fact that this

1624
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:07,600
for all all n plus1 vertex graphs tells

1625
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:10,880
us that this next line should start with

1626
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:12,480
suppose g is an n plus1 vertex graph

1627
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,760
because this is the part that many

1628
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:18,640
students get wrong. Um they will often

1629
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:21,120
say suppose g is an arbitrary nvertex

1630
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:23,199
graph and then they go on to try to

1631
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:24,480
prove stuff about some n plus1 vertex

1632
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:26,400
graphs but they haven't shown that

1633
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:28,000
they're really getting all of them. It's

1634
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:31,199
this for all that tells us we should

1635
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:34,960
start like this and no other way.

1636
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:37,960
All right. So what do we do next? Um so

1637
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,960
vertices

1638
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:43,520
v1

1639
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:46,560
vn vn plus one. So we have whatever

1640
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:49,560
vertex order we're using. Now the greedy

1641
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:49,560
algorithm

1642
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:58,120
will color V1 through VN

1643
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:04,520
as if VN + one and its edges

1644
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,360
didn't exist.

1645
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,480
The algorithm never looks at edges that

1646
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:16,560
connect to vertices that haven't been

1647
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:18,159
colored yet.

1648
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,640
So as far as the greedy algorithm is

1649
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:23,440
concerned, coloring vertices v1 through

1650
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:26,000
vn, so all but one of the vertices in

1651
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:29,679
our graph is going to look just like

1652
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:32,480
coloring an nvertex graph.

1653
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:36,800
Yeah. So

1654
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:38,640
this what's called a subgraph

1655
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,040
um

1656
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:43,040
on

1657
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:46,719
v1 through vn if we take just the first

1658
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:49,679
n vertices make a subgraph of just its

1659
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:51,760
um just its vertices as our vertex set

1660
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:54,760
and the edges between them as our edge

1661
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,760
set

1662
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,320
with all their edges.

1663
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:07,080
This subgraph

1664
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,080
also has max degree D.

1665
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:11,000
Uh oh, sorry.

1666
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,679
We're supposed to prove something about

1667
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:20,000
all n plus1 vertex graphs with max

1668
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:23,120
degree d. So assume g is some n plus1

1669
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,800
vertex graph with max degree d.

1670
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,239
Then when we look at the subgraph where

1671
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,719
we're only taking some of the vertices

1672
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:31,360
and some of the edges, well degree can't

1673
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:36,480
go up when you do that.

1674
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:39,719
So this subgraph also has max degree at

1675
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,719
most d.

1676
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,880
Okay

1677
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:51,159
by p of n because we assumed p of n.

1678
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:59,960
These n vertices

1679
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:59,960
will use at most D+1 colors.

1680
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:03,840
Right?

1681
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:06,239
We have an nvertex graph that we're

1682
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:07,760
talking about. We know it satisfies the

1683
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:09,920
property. So we get the conclusion

1684
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:13,040
because of our assumption. So it uses at

1685
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:14,560
most D plus1 colors. So now all we need

1686
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:17,960
to talk about is the last step of the

1687
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:17,960
greedy algorithm.

1688
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:23,040
Last step

1689
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:26,400
for VN plus one.

1690
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:28,320
Well, VN plus one has degree at most D.

1691
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,159
So it has at most D colors that

1692
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:34,400
conflict.

1693
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:36,080
So um one of the first D+1 colors will

1694
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:38,640
be sufficient.

1695
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:40,400
Um uses

1696
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:43,120
one

1697
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:45,360
through D+1 uses one of these colors

1698
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:48,400
because you can only have D conflicts

1699
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:51,760
because this has degree at most D.

1700
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:53,679
Therefore, the last color also uses one

1701
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,600
of the first D+1 colors. So, the whole

1702
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,880
coloring uses that many colors. And

1703
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:01,520
we're done with the proof.

1704
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,880
Did that make sense?

1705
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,400
If it didn't, come up, talk to me

1706
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,920
afterward. I'm happy to stay and answer

1707
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:09,239
questions. Thank you so much. We'll see

1708
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,239
you on Thursday.
