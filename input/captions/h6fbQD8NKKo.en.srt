1
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,960
all right let's get started uh today we

2
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,080
continue probability the last theme of

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,800
the class we have three more lectures

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,599
about probability um today's lecture is

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,640
about expectation which is a nice

6
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,640
summary it's a one number summary of a

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,680
random variable remember from last time

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,879
a random variable is neither random nor

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,960
variable it's really a

10
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,160
function from your sample space to

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,559
something usually real

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,039
numbers uh so we use this to represent

13
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,320
sort of some computation about an

14
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,199
experiment we had a similar uh setup

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,000
with derived variables if you remember

16
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,160
back to um State machines uh which were

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,879
also not variables they were really

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,440
functions from the state of the machine

19
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:02,920
to numbers so random variable the same

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,080
idea if I give you if I tell you what

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,880
sample like what random events happened

22
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,479
you can compute a single uh value for

23
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,119
this variable that's the meaning and we

24
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,479
had a particular type of random variable

25
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,119
that's going to be really useful today

26
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:17,720
which is an indicator random variable

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,720
where the output is always zero or one

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,320
indicating something happened that's the

29
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,640
one or didn't

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,400
happen so functions are complicated you

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,000
know if I want to write down a function

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,840
I got to write down a lot of numbers one

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,520
for every uh possible sample so uh

34
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,000
expectation is a way to take that

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,240
complicated function and reduce it down

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,399
to one number obviously it's not going

37
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,640
to tell you everything about the

38
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:43,520
function but it tells you what you

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,200
expect to happen on average what is the

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,240
it's not the most likely thing but if

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,960
you take all the things that could

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,000
happen and you average them that's

43
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,840
expectation so let's define that

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,320
precisely match my notation here so

45
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,320
let's call uh random variable X

46
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,119
over uh sample space

47
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,399
s uh then the

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,720
expectation of X which we write e x of X

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,120
although often it's written just e of X

50
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,080
so if you look at other probability

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,959
sources you might see that as well both

52
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,120
of these mean the same thing uh it's

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,599
going to be a weighted average weighted

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,800
by probabilities so we're gonna sum over

55
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:40,360
all possible samples which we call

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,159
Omega and S of the probability of that

57
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,360
outcome

58
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:48,239
times uh X the function X evaluated at

59
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,319
that income

60
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,239
outcome Omega for

61
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,760
outcome uh so if

62
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,400
I right so this is a particular type of

63
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,159
average right because the probability

64
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,480
sum to one and in particular if the

65
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:04,440
probabilities are all equal this is

66
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,440
literally the average value of

67
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,280
x okay but of course we would like what

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,560
we care about is the weighted by the

69
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,360
probability if there's something that's

70
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,560
more likely to occur that should get a

71
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:20,200
bigger multiplier in front Okay so this

72
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,200
is going to be some average of

73
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,680
X sometimes the expectation is also

74
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,040
called the average uh let's do a very

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,040
simple

76
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:36,599
example which is we roll a

77
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,599
fair uh six-sided

78
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,400
die I happen to have such a die right

79
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,760
here so we roll it it has values one to

80
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:51,560
six each equally likely here I got a

81
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:55,120
one uh what is the expected

82
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,200
value okay so sample space here is one

83
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,879
up to

84
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:04,760
six all the probabilities are one six

85
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:07,400
probability of I occurring is 1 over 6

86
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,560
and so the expected

87
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,879
value uh I should probably give this a

88
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,519
name let's call it D probability that uh

89
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:19,959
D equals I for any particular I between

90
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,759
1 and six is 1 over 6 and so the

91
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:25,720
expected value of D the DI

92
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:31,039
roll is from that formula well it's just

93
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:35,520
uh the probability that uh we get uh a 1

94
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:40,039
* 1 plus the probability that we get a

95
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,840
two * 2 plus and so on uh I'm going to

96
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:43,800
rewrite that a little bit so these these

97
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:51,680
probabilities are all six so we've got

98
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:53,759
16 * 1 plus6 * 2 plus up to 16 *

99
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,759
6 these

100
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,600
numbers it's our favorite summation the

101
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:05,120
Triangular number uh this

102
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,919
is uh gal right so if I factor out the

103
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,320
six in front then we have that times the

104
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,680
sum 1 through six which you should

105
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,840
remember is 6 * 7 over

106
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:22,560
2 it's getting a little crowded this is

107
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:24,840
1 over 6 * 6 * 7 over two let me get a

108
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,440
color

109
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,440
chalk it's time

110
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:34,840
for uh the exciting cancellation moment

111
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,600
the sixes cancel and so we're left with

112
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,800
7 over2 also known as

113
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,560
3.5 which is as you would expect the

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,639
average of numbers one through six um

115
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,840
but notice notably a point of this

116
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:52,000
example is that the expectation is not

117
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:55,759
actually a valid outcome you never get a

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,120
3.5 on a die but you get 1 2 3 four five

119
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,000
and six and the average of those is

120
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,080
three and a

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,400
half okay so don't expect don't expect

122
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,800
the expectation to be uh an actual point

123
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,759
in your an actual value that X could

124
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,960
take

125
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,840
on all right let's do a more interesting

126
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,840
example which we're going to use a

127
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,639
lot what if I have an indicator random

128
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:27,759
variable also X oh call it

129
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:33,199
I uh for event a so remember this means

130
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:36,240
uh I is one if event a occurred if what

131
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,240
if the sample that happened is in a and

132
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:45,479
zero if a did not occur okay so let's

133
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:51,280
try to compute the expected value of

134
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:53,199
I okay uh so um this is a little tricky

135
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,120
with this formula because s even though

136
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,720
I only takes on two values s can be you

137
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,280
know size a million who knows there's a

138
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,160
lot of different random outcomes that

139
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,759
could happen and then I kind of projects

140
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,479
them all down to this very simple 01

141
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:11,319
space so I'm just going to write the

142
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:17,440
definition first Omega and S probability

143
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:19,000
of Omega times I of Omega but this thing

144
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,919
is either zero or

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,039
one so this is a summation and we

146
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,720
remember one of the techniques for

147
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,960
dealing with summations is to rearrange

148
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,240
the terms in some useful way and given

149
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,919
that every term here is either

150
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,479
multiplied by zero which case it

151
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:37,039
disappears or multiply by

152
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,280
one let's maybe collect like terms so we

153
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:44,720
can split this summation into two parts

154
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:48,879
there's the sum where W is in a

155
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,639
compl uh probability of Omega time0

156
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,639
because I of something in a complement

157
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:58,840
here is

158
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:00,159
zero uh or it could be Omega inside a

159
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,159
without the complex

160
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,960
and then we get probability of Omega *

161
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:08,400
1 so these

162
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,520
disappear and we're just left with and

163
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:16,039
the one cancels or is doesn't do

164
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,720
anything so we get the sum of uh Omega

165
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,479
and a Time probability of

166
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,120
Omega and this is our definition of

167
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,120
probability of

168
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,080
a so that's nice and simple another way

169
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,720
to write this that's more directly about

170
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,279
I is this is the probability that I

171
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,240
equals 1 so the expected value of an

172
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,800
indicator random variable is always the

173
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,680
probability that that indicator random

174
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,120
variable equals one this is just a fun

175
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,480
fact because I only takes on zero and

176
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,800
one the zeros don't show to disappear

177
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,160
from the expectation formula and the

178
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,720
ones basically add up just the

179
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,399
probabilities of of the event occurring

180
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,320
okay we're going to use this fact

181
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,440
several times today so it's an example

182
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
and a useful

183
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:08,920
LMA all right uh probability I'm told uh

184
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,320
is was originally invented to analyze

185
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,000
gambling so let's put that to good use

186
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,839
and do some gambling so let me Define a

187
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,640
game and then I'm going to need a

188
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,320
volunteer couple volunteers

189
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,560
to play this game with

190
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,480
me it doesn't have a fancy name we're

191
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:31,360
just going to call it the gambling game

192
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,360
um so we're going to have three

193
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,880
lers and we're going to follow these

194
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,880
sequence of

195
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,560
steps everybody has some pile of money

196
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:50,320
which we're going to represent by

197
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,320
candy but I'll write it as

198
00:09:51,040 --> 00:10:01,320
dollars so every round every player puts

199
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,320
$2 into a shared pot then um each

200
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:09,200
player uh

201
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,200
picks heads or

202
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,959
tails you may have played this game in

203
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,079
the single player version you just try

204
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,320
to guess the outcome of a coin then

205
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:18,320
we're going to flip a Fair

206
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,680
coin okay with with multiplayer it's

207
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,760
more interesting let's say now mult we

208
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,920
could have multiple winners right maybe

209
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,440
two people guessed heads and the outcome

210
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,839
of the coin was heads then what we're

211
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,560
going to do is take the pot of money

212
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,519
that everyone uh added to and evenly

213
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,600
distribute it among the winners among

214
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:44,360
the people that guess the coin outcome

215
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,920
correctly so we

216
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,920
split

217
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,920
po

218
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,639
equally

219
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,639
among

220
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,800
winners uh there's one special case

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,079
which is maybe no one guesses the

222
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,160
correct value

223
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,360
in that case uh we'll also equally split

224
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,760
the pot which is equivalent to just

225
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,399
giving your money back and trying again

226
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,959
so we're going to play this uh game many

227
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,440
rounds and our goal your goal is to of

228
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,079
course maximize the amount of money you

229
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,320
get who would like to play this game oh

230
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,040
so many people all right I'm afraid it's

231
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:24,959
only a three- player game uh so I'm

232
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:28,320
gonna pick Jenny my accomplice uh and uh

233
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,320
how about you

234
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:36,320
yeah uh no totally fair game don't worry

235
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,680
uh what's your name Cleo Cleo all right

236
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,880
so everyone welcome Cleo and Jenny to

237
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,000
the

238
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,079
stage

239
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,360
yeah uh I I want you to be in like

240
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,920
equally hard and uh good good position

241
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,079
so we're going to put you in the middle

242
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,079
the

243
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,079
Cleo try to keep track here and we've

244
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,399
got a

245
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,800
coin uh except I don't have a coin I

246
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:12,839
have a Giant die so uh we're going to

247
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:15,240
say was it heads H H is uh huge I gotta

248
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:19,120
write this down or I'm gonna forget H is

249
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,720
huge and T is

250
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:26,800
Tiny okay so one two three is a Tails

251
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:30,720
four five6 is an H all

252
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,680
right so uh I'm gonna guess first then C

253
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,079
why don't you stand in the middle so

254
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,440
we're like in order here uh so I'll

255
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:40,120
guess Tails my usual

256
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,199
heads

257
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:47,000
Tails okay let's roll this

258
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:49,240
die that doesn't feel very fair but okay

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,199
well I'll do different types of rolls so

260
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,720
we got a four which is

261
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:57,600
H clear winds oh I forgot to distribute

262
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:01,079
the money okay uh these are all equal so

263
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:08,000
pick your pile of

264
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:09,399
cash which are uh poker chips and so

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,399
it's I think more fun if everyone can

266
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:15,800
see the pile so let me so uh we were

267
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,480
supposed to start out by putting two in

268
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,720
to the pot and then you are the only

269
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,000
winner for the pot so you get all this

270
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,639
money it's already looking good all

271
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,720
right so I'm going to flip the the we

272
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,000
should I should flip after guessing a

273
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,519
little too Force otherwise all right

274
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,760
I'll try Heads This Time Tails Tails

275
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,760
heads

276
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,760
Heads okay and we

277
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,880
flip okay six is high oh oh I forgot to

278
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,800
do our thing two

279
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,639
in uh and then we evenly split the pot

280
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,600
all

281
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,480
right

282
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,399
great very consistent coin right play

283
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
this game properly supposed to put the

284
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,720
money supposed to put your money where

285
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,199
your mouth is before you play the game

286
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,199
all right uh I'll try

287
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:05,199
heads

288
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,920
Heads yeah three heads in a row is never

289
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,639
useful uh because whatever happens we

290
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,120
will just take our money back all right

291
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:18,240
so we

292
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,240
flip this is quite fun another heads wow

293
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,560
it's very consistent coin

294
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:27,600
here all right so you just a St

295
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:34,120
distribution we put our money back in to

296
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:37,120
each uh I'll do Tails heads Heads Tails

297
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,519
Tails very efficient this is great I'm

298
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,240
the slow part here

299
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:44,800
rolling oh yeah another heads

300
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,000
great I love this there's another

301
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,399
problem we'll be working on which is how

302
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,519
many times you have to flip a coin until

303
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:56,199
you get tails the answer is two

304
00:14:50,519 --> 00:15:00,839
but uh all right so back in and uh I'll

305
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:04,040
do Tails sorry heads heads

306
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,040
else all

307
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,720
right based on how this D's been

308
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:13,399
going good

309
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,120
guess all right have we played enough do

310
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,040
you get the idea not yet oh not yet

311
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,600
you're you're you're almost depleted

312
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,120
there Jenny all right let's see uh one

313
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,440
more maybe we should keep going till we

314
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,920
get a Tails right that can't take

315
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:31,040
forever famous last words I've done this

316
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,120
before all right hey head Tails Tails

317
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,279
heads

318
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,199
Heads now the gamblers ruin would say

319
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,759
we're due for a tails now right it's

320
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,440
more likely than

321
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:46,360
50%

322
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:49,560
oh Gambler was wrong it's 5050 every

323
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,560
time all

324
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,360
right uh heads tails

325
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,519
yes finally

326
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,720
aails all right Cleo here has won

327
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,959
basically all the candy you can take as

328
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,440
many as you like because I'm actually

329
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,600
lactose intolerant so I can't eat these

330
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,759
uh so both of you are welcome to take as

331
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,920
many as you like um so that's the

332
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:28,959
gambling game now is it coincidence that

333
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:31,120
Cleo won and I lost no Wasing Jenny was

334
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,720
picking the other one the other from you

335
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,759
indeed very observant this is why Jenny

336
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,560
was so fast at guessing Jenny's one of

337
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,480
our Tas by the way that's uh how I

338
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,079
convinced her to cheat uh but she

339
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,079
cheated in order to destroy me uh so

340
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:48,160
there's this fun strategy which is uh if

341
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,120
you guess the opposite of one of the

342
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,079
previous players which if you guess in

343
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,839
sequence like this is easy to do Cleo

344
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,720
could have done it Cleo actually did it

345
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,160
most of the time I think there were only

346
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,720
a couple times one time when we matched

347
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,959
um and that's a good strategy uh in

348
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,839
particular uh well let's analyze shall

349
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:12,760
we how do we analyze a game like this so

350
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,240
small we just draw the decision tree or

351
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,880
the probability tree all right now it's

352
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,039
a little bigger than some of the ones

353
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,880
we've done uh luckily um the whole thing

354
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,880
is

355
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,679
symmetric it doesn't really matter which

356
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,919
one you do first uh the whole thing is

357
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:27,919
symmetric so I'm going to do it in the

358
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,160
order of let's branch on what player one

359
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,080
does player two player three and then

360
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,280
what the coin does and then we're going

361
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,080
to get some outcome uh which I'll Define

362
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,000
in a

363
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,120
second uh so uh it turns out whether the

364
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,080
first player guesses heads or tails but

365
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,120
because the coin is random uh it's going

366
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,640
to be symmetric so let's just ignore the

367
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,760
whole right half of this space and

368
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,240
pretend we're in this left half so

369
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,120
suppose I always guessed

370
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,160
heads uh or somebody always guesses

371
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,559
heads I think it's probably going to be

372
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,400
me that I care about yeah uh then

373
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,919
uh player two guesses heads or tails now

374
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,080
we haven't said what the probabilities

375
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:08,840
are here right uh we didn't I was trying

376
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,799
to be roughly 50/50 but I wasn't

377
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,320
flipping a coin each time to decide how

378
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,200
I should guess the coin uh I was just

379
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,720
making some arbitrary Choice C was

380
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,520
making some arbitrary Choice Jenny was

381
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,320
making some less arbitrary Choice and

382
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,679
then the coin this part is random so

383
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:28,960
this one is one half either

384
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:31,159
way so that's helpful

385
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,799
and then we get some outcome which I'm

386
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:37,400
going to measure the uh net for uh

387
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,840
player

388
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,280
one that's this number and I wrote it

389
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,600
down here because it's very easy to get

390
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,960
these wrong uh so the first case is that

391
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,600
we all guest heads and then it doesn't

392
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,400
matter what we do just our money is

393
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,520
going to go back or the pots going to go

394
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,559
back to even distribution whether we win

395
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,200
or lose the the money goes uh back to

396
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:00,120
where it started so the net for player

397
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,120
one in particular is zero so these are

398
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,320
boring uh then we have uh heads Heads

399
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,799
tails for the three players and so then

400
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,520
if it's heads these two players one and

401
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:13,880
so they evenly distribute so we're

402
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,600
always putting six in each time so

403
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,640
they'd each get

404
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,919
three uh but they started by putting in

405
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,400
two and so the net gain is only one this

406
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:27,360
is uh 3 minus two we gained three but we

407
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,400
had to pay two to get there okay or we

408
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,440
lose whenever we lose and all of these

409
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Tales branches uh player one is going to

410
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,640
lose because they gu heads and in that

411
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,640
case you get minus two because you had

412
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,000
to put in the two uh so this case is the

413
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,360
same there's two heads and so you each

414
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,440
get three and so it's a net of one and

415
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:49,559
then there's this case this is the case

416
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:51,000
you really aiming for this is the best

417
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,559
for player

418
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,679
one uh because in this case player one

419
00:19:53,559 --> 00:20:00,000
is the unique winner so here uh there

420
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:03,000
was heads uh and and the other two guess

421
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,440
tals and the coin came up heads and so

422
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,840
that's where you're really trying to be

423
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,559
uh the unique winner in this game the

424
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,520
less common winner that's when you get

425
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:17,400
lots of

426
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,400
points okay so uh let's compute the

427
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,280
expectation to compute the expectation

428
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,159
we need to know what the probabilities

429
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,919
are on these branches or something about

430
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:29,240
them uh and I'm going to start by saying

431
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:33,559
let's uh

432
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:33,559
that uh all

433
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,520
players are uh

434
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,520
uniform and

435
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,520
independent

436
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,840
so so 50/50 on every Branch okay then

437
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,960
the probabilities down here let me use

438
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,760
color are going to

439
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:58,240
be 116th in the whole tree or 1/8 in

440
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,880
this sub tree so I'm going to just

441
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,440
condition on the H in the beginning and

442
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,320
so I'll write uh 1/8 down here but if

443
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,360
you were drawing the whole tree you'd

444
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,919
have to write

445
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,520
11/16th okay each of these things occurs

446
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:11,520
with 1/8

447
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:19,240
probability get yeah each of these 1/8

448
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,440
and so we get the expected value

449
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,000
is uh

450
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:31,360
1/8 times the sum of these values 0 + 0

451
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:35,000
+ 1 - 2 + 1 - 2 + 4 -

452
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,279
2 uh which I hope is equal to zero

453
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,360
because it negative is uh six and the

454
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:43,520
positive is also six so this is what you

455
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,159
might call a fair game right the your

456
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,880
expected winnings are zero so you're

457
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:48,440
just as likely well it doesn't mean

458
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,520
you're just as likely to go above or go

459
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:56,480
to below but on average you will break

460
00:21:52,520 --> 00:22:01,720
even okay uh but that's not what we

461
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:04,960
did uh we considered the case where uh

462
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,360
let's say player two does not equal

463
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,799
player three which is something that

464
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,679
player three could enforce and that's

465
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,799
what Jenny was doing always choosing

466
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,960
opposite of Cleo

467
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,520
here in that

468
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,760
case

469
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,279
uh it's really bad for me right because

470
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,840
whatever I guess out here if there's

471
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,799
both a heads and a Tails out here if

472
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,240
you're if they're always guessing

473
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,159
opposite one of them's heads one of

474
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,760
them's Tails so that means I always

475
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:34,000
match one of

476
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,400
them guaranteed and the other of them is

477
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,640
in the unique pile and so they have a

478
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,640
50% chance like in this situation Cleo

479
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,360
has a 50% chance of getting that

480
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,600
plus4 there's still a 50% chance that we

481
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,679
uh that it came up tails of course not

482
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,279
with this die but in principle there's a

483
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:55,000
50% chance that it comes up uh taals but

484
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,720
then we each only get one point so if

485
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,279
you're focusing on my winnings I will

486
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:03,159
never get

487
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:06,000
four dollars in a round with uh Jenny

488
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:08,799
strategy right I will always get either

489
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,159
one or minus two that doesn't sound like

490
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:14,000
a very good game for me if I randomly

491
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,360
get 50% chance I get a one 50% chance I

492
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,600
get a minus

493
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:24,279
two um so this this was uh I guess

494
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,520
expected uh net for player one that's

495
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:29,240
what we've been Computing so in this

496
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,120
situation uh the expected

497
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:38,200
net for player one uh if you want to be

498
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:41,799
precise you can say um it's this sub

499
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:44,600
tree here this is when uh the last two

500
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:46,919
guesses are heads Tails or tails heads

501
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,080
is the middle part of this sub tree and

502
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,840
you can see uh my possible outcomes are

503
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,400
limited to these

504
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,360
guys and

505
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,039
uh it turns out they're equally likely

506
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,799
uh in fact independ dependent of what

507
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,360
player two does I won't try to prove

508
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,640
that here but um because all that

509
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,919
matters is this last coin flip 50 if

510
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,960
it's heads then I get a plus one if it's

511
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,320
Tails I get a minus two every time in

512
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,000
this half of the tree and so it's it

513
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,600
ends up being half in other words the

514
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,679
average of 1 minus two also known as

515
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,919
minus a

516
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:28,880
half so given how Jenny played in fact I

517
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,080
expect to lose and you saw that happen

518
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,760
Jenny also happened to lose the way this

519
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,159
is practical if you're a gambler is you

520
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,880
if you have two players that collude

521
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,080
they decide whatever happens we're going

522
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,200
to take our total winnings and split it

523
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,600
evenly between us at the end of the game

524
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,279
after all the rounds are done then this

525
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,600
this is not quite a guarantee but it's a

526
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:55,600
pretty good bet that together uh Cleo

527
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,960
and Jenny would get most of the coins

528
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,640
most of the money uh because they have a

529
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,360
their their expected outcome is plus a

530
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:08,440
half I believe should be the compliment

531
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,520
plus yeah anyway it's positive and my

532
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,640
expected expect expectation is negative

533
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,080
so uh yeah don't play this game if you

534
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,200
don't trust players two and three not to

535
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,520
collude all

536
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,520
right cool you might think this is a

537
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,720
silly game who would ever play this game

538
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,399
well the Massachusetts lottery uh played

539
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,200
this game uh it's a little more

540
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:34,039
complicated there's you I think you had

541
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,480
up to four digits and you uh tried to

542
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,120
guess a sequence of four digits that

543
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,360
would come up randomly I mean pretty

544
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,080
similar to lotteries today they just

545
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:43,200
have more numbers uh and there's this

546
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,120
great MIT Professor Herman shernoff who

547
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,799
we'll talk some of his probability

548
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,080
results later in the class um and he

549
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:50,559
wrote this paper how to beat the

550
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,039
Massachusetts numbers game which is what

551
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,480
the lottery was called originally um and

552
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,919
he just looked at some data and it's a

553
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,679
similar situation if there are many

554
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:02,039
lottery winners they evenly split the

555
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,880
pot also the state takes like 40% or 60%

556
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:07,600
cut I forget which way it goes um but

557
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,000
even then uh he made money off of the

558
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,919
lottery and there have been more recent

559
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,120
versions of this run by MIT students I

560
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,840
hear uh to make a lot of money off the

561
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,200
massachusett lottery and they've since

562
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,720
changed the rules to make those

563
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,279
strategies hard to run uh but in

564
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,640
particular uh he executed this made a

565
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:27,000
lot of money the whole the idea is if

566
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,600
you can guess numbers that are less

567
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,840
likely to be guessed by other people and

568
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,279
all numbers are equally likely then you

569
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,919
expect to win and it turns out people

570
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:39,640
are so predictable uh what's this say

571
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,799
zeros and nines were unpopular smaller

572
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,640
digits were popular and so we ended up

573
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:47,559
just going with random numbers from like

574
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:52,080
five to eight I think uh and or and

575
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:54,159
zero9 maybe um and uh he won not a lot

576
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,640
of money but he wants some money uh you

577
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,279
can read the paper for more details it's

578
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,720
pretty pretty fun read it goes through

579
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:02,720
all the probability and stuff stuff uh

580
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,799
this is like a simplified version so

581
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,279
cool practical now you know how to make

582
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:11,960
money uh let's go on

583
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,760
to uh some other ways to compute

584
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,880
expectation and some more examples and

585
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,880
so

586
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,480
on all right um we talked

587
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:28,799
about so here we computed if we roll a

588
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,360
single six-sided die the expect value of

589
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,000
that single die is 3.5 what if I rolled

590
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,440
two dice A and B and I want to know the

591
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,799
expectation of dice a die

592
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,960
a should also be 3.5 right if I roll two

593
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,480
dice it doesn't shouldn't change

594
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,000
anything but if I computed it explicitly

595
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,120
in this way it would be really tedious

596
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,080
because the sample space would go from 1

597
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:54,080
through six to 1 through six squared so

598
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,960
now there's 36 different possible

599
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,399
outcomes and for each of them I need to

600
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,200
like write down a term and add it all up

601
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,840
it will come out to 3.5 but that's super

602
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,960
annoying to do so here's a nice theorem

603
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,080
that makes it easy to do this with six

604
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,559
terms instead of 36

605
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,720
terms um if I have a random variable X

606
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:17,159
and I want its expectation this is equal

607
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:21,799
to

608
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:23,880
sum where X is in the range of big

609
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:29,120
X of

610
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:33,399
probability x = x time

611
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,399
uh Little X let me erase

612
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:41,559
this my terrible losing

613
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,960
game how many coins flips till Tales one

614
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,399
two three four five six seven all right

615
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,440
keep that in mind seven coin flips to

616
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:52,039
get

617
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:55,200
Tails um all right so here's a formula

618
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:57,840
um it's really exactly what we did

619
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,039
here so when we we wrote down here are

620
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,120
all the possible outcomes and we

621
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:03,919
multiply them by what the random

622
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,360
variable could be and when it was an

623
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,519
indicator random variable was either Z

624
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,840
or one so there were two groups in

625
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:16,000
general there's whatever the range of X

626
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:18,559
groups okay so if I

627
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,919
um yeah so this is exactly this this

628
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,559
kind of clustering where we split it

629
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,200
into two sums each of them was the

630
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,760
probability of being in that group times

631
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,600
the outcome of that group this sum is

632
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,640
exactly uh probability

633
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,679
of not

634
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,720
a and this

635
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,799
sum is

636
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:39,840
probability of

637
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,480
a uh and in general if we if we split

638
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,679
into not two groups but all the

639
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,399
different possible values of big X could

640
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,080
be Little X for every little X in the

641
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:52,159
range of big x uh then this is we get a

642
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,679
sum of uh probability of outcomes which

643
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,760
is exactly the probability that big x

644
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,559
equals small X and we multiply that by

645
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,919
small X because that's what we have

646
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,679
in the definition of expectation okay so

647
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,679
this is an easy theorem I won't write

648
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,840
down a proof because uh it's this thing

649
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,360
generalized a little

650
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,559
bit

651
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:16,440
uh and let's do an

652
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,440
example maybe on a different

653
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:35,039
board suppose I want to know

654
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:35,039
the number of hearts in a three card

655
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,159
hand okay so what that means is I have

656
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,600
52 cards in a deck I randomly choose

657
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:44,840
three cards without replacement so just

658
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,480
like your drawing from the top of a

659
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,600
randomly shuffled deck I want to know

660
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,799
how many hearts do I get in

661
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,880
expectation let's call this

662
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:56,760
uh

663
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,919
yeah expected number of

664
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:03,919
Hearts uh

665
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,919
is if we just use the

666
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,120
definition probability of w times the

667
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,799
number of hearts in

668
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:17,919
Omega this would be the definition and S

669
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:23,600
here is uh Size

670
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:25,679
52 cubed not quite 52 * 51 * 50 it's

671
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,559
really

672
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,080
big uh so I don't want to have to

673
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:31,000
compute this this explicitly instead I'm

674
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,399
going to use this formula and say well

675
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,200
look the number of hearts in a three

676
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:39,200
card hand is 0 1 two or three so uh I

677
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:44,240
can write this as the probability that

678
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,000
number of Hearts equals 0 times 0 okay

679
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,399
that's not very interesting uh we can

680
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,720
take the probability uh number of Hearts

681
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:54,360
equals

682
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,519
one uh and multiply that by one plus

683
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,120
probability the number of Hearts equals

684
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:01,519
2

685
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:04,360
2 plus probability number of Hearts

686
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,200
equal 3 *

687
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:10,200
3 okay and the so now I have three terms

688
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,159
relatively easy and these are hopefully

689
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,440
things you know how to compute um for

690
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:21,360
example probability I get three hearts

691
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,799
I'm going to cheat um this is like 13

692
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:29,840
choose

693
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:29,840
3 uh divided 52 choose three

694
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,600
right because uh this is there are 13

695
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,200
different heart cards so uh the number

696
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,080
of ways to choose three hearts out of

697
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,480
those 13 heart cards is 13 choose three

698
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,639
the total number of ways to choose three

699
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,519
cards is 52 choose three and so that's a

700
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:47,440
probability and you need to multiply it

701
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:49,080
by three uh to get this formula and

702
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,480
there's some similar things for these

703
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,360
terms I think I maybe won't write them

704
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,480
down

705
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,279
uh maybe I'll write down the middle one

706
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,120
just for KS I went through the effort of

707
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:02,600
of figuring these out so this is at some

708
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,720
this point should be something that you

709
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,720
could do uh just like on your problem

710
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,919
set these are combinatorics problems you

711
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:13,440
know how to

712
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,600
solve okay so you get some sum of

713
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,679
binomial terms but hey it has some

714
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,919
reasonably small size of course these

715
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,440
have huge factorials in them uh but you

716
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:24,200
know it's only choose one two or three

717
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,760
so they're not too big you plug this

718
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,720
into wol from alpha say and you get

719
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,559
three quarters

720
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,200
very nice

721
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:37,080
number we might come back to

722
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,080
this all right

723
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,039
uh a lot of the time because this is

724
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,960
61200 we're working with integers

725
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,240
natural

726
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,000
numbers you know all of the um random

727
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,519
variables I've defined so far I believe

728
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,840
are

729
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,960
integers we happen to get an expectation

730
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,880
that was not an integer but all of the

731
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,480
values that could take on or or X or

732
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Hearts could take on was an integer so

733
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,919
let's consider the case where uh I'll

734
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,560
say the

735
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:14,599
co-domain of

736
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:17,599
X is the natural numbers 0 1 two 3 um

737
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:19,599
remember co- domain is just what you

738
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,079
declare this function could take on for

739
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,639
values it doesn't have to take on those

740
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:25,280
values range here the intent is these

741
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,480
are just the values that are taken on by

742
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,800
this function and so I didn't have to

743
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,839
write

744
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,119
uh even though the number of Hearts

745
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,399
could I don't know be 100 in some other

746
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:36,240
card uh on this sample space we know

747
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,919
it's just 0 one two or three and so we

748
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,440
just need four

749
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,919
terms okay but let's suppose uh

750
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,800
potentially all the natural numbers are

751
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:48,119
there but not necessarily all of

752
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:51,040
them then uh expected value of x has a

753
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:53,280
nice form and this is a Formula I

754
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,599
encourage you not to memorize you should

755
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,879
write it down on your cheat sheet and

756
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,040
always look at it up from there because

757
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:01,280
it's easy to get uh wrong especially the

758
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,280
next

759
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:07,240
one one to

760
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:13,320
Infinity

761
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:15,680
probability xal I * I okay this is just

762
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,040
uh exactly this theorem nothing exciting

763
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,880
here I wrote a sum over a range now I'm

764
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,880
writing a sum over an explicit range the

765
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,760
one clever idea I had is Skip zero

766
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,160
because zero is going to get the zero

767
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,480
case is going to get multiplied by zero

768
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,640
so that never matters so we get to start

769
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,359
at one wow I saved this one step forever

770
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,560
more uh and then sum up to Infinity if

771
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:39,599
we might have to go that

772
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:45,000
high okay so that is true uh but there's

773
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,839
an even cooler form which is sum IAL 1

774
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,400
to

775
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:52,119
Infinity of probability of X greater

776
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,000
than or equal to

777
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,640
I

778
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,880
or there's no I

779
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:04,520
here I equal 0 to Infinity

780
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:09,520
probability X greater than

781
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:13,440
I okay so this this part is just this

782
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,960
theorem uh this step is I just change

783
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,440
greater than equal to to greater than

784
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:22,280
and changed where I started I so here it

785
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:24,560
started I uh one and here it started i0

786
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,920
and so here I'm effectively adding one

787
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,720
to I and so I get to do or subtracting

788
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,400
one from I so I do greater than instead

789
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,280
of greater than equal to so these two

790
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,040
Arrow equalities should be obvious and

791
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:39,599
this one is the interesting one

792
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,599
so let's prove

793
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,040
that okay proof

794
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,359
okay I want to claim I want to compute

795
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,280
this sum and claim that it equals this

796
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:14,040
one and I'm going to do it by writing it

797
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,520
in kind of an obvious way first I'm just

798
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,000
going to write out the infinite series

799
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,000
with dot dot dot so we've got x equal to

800
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,200
1

801
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,920
plus uh X greater equal to 2 plus X

802
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,319
greater equal to 3 just give me a moment

803
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,920
and I'll write all the remaining terms

804
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:34,760
might take a while um and now I want to

805
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,359
expand these

806
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:40,560
out

807
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:42,960
into uh separate pieces in terms of x

808
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,960
equal

809
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,319
I okay so this is what is probability

810
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,359
that X greater equal to one given that

811
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:53,720
again that they're all natural

812
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:58,200
numbers uh we know this is probability x

813
00:37:53,720 --> 00:38:01,880
= 1 plus probability x = 2 plus plus

814
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,560
probability xal 3 plus and so

815
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,040
on up to

816
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,839
Infinity okay what's this

817
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:17,280
one uh well same thing but starting here

818
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:21,079
probability x = 2 plus probability x = 3

819
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,960
plus and so on this

820
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:27,839
one uh starts over here

821
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:32,200
probability xal 3

822
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:36,440
okay so if I now sum this

823
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:38,680
way down the columns I get 1 *

824
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:43,319
probability x =

825
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:46,400
1 plus 2 * probability x =

826
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:48,200
2 because there are two values here

827
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,599
there are two ranges here for X that

828
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,560
include xals 2 these two two is not

829
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,599
greater equal to 3 four five and so on

830
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:59,640
so I get exactly two of them I get

831
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:02,800
exactly three uh probability xal

832
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:04,880
3 and so on and if you work out the dot

833
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,359
dot dots VI a proof by induction you get

834
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,280
some I probability xal I and that's what

835
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:12,800
we

836
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,640
wanted one to

837
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,560
Infinity so that's why these two sums

838
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,920
are the

839
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,040
same so the point is to do this work

840
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,640
once so that in the future uh if you

841
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,119
have a problem you can use any of these

842
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,920
formulas you want you could use the

843
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:30,280
definition of expectation

844
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,920
which is a sum over outcomes in the

845
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,400
sample space or you could use this

846
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:38,359
formula sum over all the things in the

847
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:42,200
range uh with equality here and then you

848
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:43,560
multiply by X or if in the special case

849
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,000
where your function only takes on

850
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,359
Integer values so this doesn't work if

851
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,040
you have other real

852
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:51,079
numbers uh then you can use one of these

853
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,680
three formulas probably the last one or

854
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:54,359
the first one are the useful ones if

855
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,319
it's easy to compute the probability x

856
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:59,119
equals something then maybe use this

857
00:39:56,319 --> 00:40:00,680
formula if it's easy to compute the

858
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,319
probability that X is bigger than

859
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,079
something this was CDF and this was pmf

860
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:07,079
remember from last time if it's easy if

861
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:08,760
you know have have a nice form for pmf

862
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,680
then use that if you have a nice form

863
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,800
for CDF use that provided you work with

864
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:18,319
integers do not try to mix these

865
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,480
formulas together don't compute like the

866
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:22,520
the sum of I equal 1 to Infinity

867
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,359
probability X greater or equal to I time

868
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,040
I that would give you something is not

869
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:29,880
expectation okay but surprisingly uh

870
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,359
stud students try so don't do that use

871
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,440
this one or this one or this

872
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:37,640
one or the

873
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,640
definition all

874
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:44,000
right cool let's do some more

875
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,000
interesting

876
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,440
examples lonely brace

877
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,960
those are

878
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,280
questions next problem is called

879
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,160
meantime to failure it's a little

880
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,960
negative uh you can use it to compute

881
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,720
successful things as well um it's

882
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,440
related to this problem of how many

883
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,319
times it is essentially this problem of

884
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,560
how many times do I have to flip a coin

885
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:30,520
until I get Tails or until I get heads

886
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,560
either

887
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:36,200
way uh I'll write it as heads because

888
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,200
that's what my not

889
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,839
say uh it's less interest it's more

890
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,960
interesting for a biased coin so let's

891
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:53,800
say uh you know the

892
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:58,640
probability of getting heads is

893
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:01,400
p i want to know uh what is is the

894
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,400
expected number of

895
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,280
flips until I get

896
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,240
heads okay so you could use this if

897
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,560
you're analyzing coin flipping um but

898
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:18,640
you can also use it for things like uh

899
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:20,839
my laptop every day there's like a one

900
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,359
in a million chance that the hard drive

901
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:27,480
dies something so how many days do I

902
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,440
expect until uh the hard drive dies hard

903
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,160
drives are usually designed engineered

904
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,720
to last like I don't know five years or

905
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,839
so and then all your hard drives that's

906
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:39,640
for spinning discs ssds are probably

907
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:42,559
different they depend on usage uh so

908
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,680
that's uh you know that's something you

909
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,240
might care about and that's why this is

910
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,839
called metime failure uh it could be

911
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,640
something more positive like maybe you

912
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,400
have an algorithm you're doing

913
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,400
randomized algorithms in the future and

914
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,720
you have an algorithm that either solves

915
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,640
your problem with some probability uh

916
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,400
one minus p no with probability P it

917
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:04,359
solves your problem and with probability

918
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,119
1 minus P it says I don't know there are

919
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:08,559
lots of algorithms like this out there

920
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,559
uh how many times do I have to run this

921
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,720
algorithm until it actually gives me an

922
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:14,119
answer so I can run it and it gives it

923
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,240
might say I don't know but if I run it

924
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:17,920
again it might then solve the problem

925
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,480
depending on the random coin flips that

926
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,640
it does so that then it's mean time to

927
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,720
success how many times do I have to flip

928
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,920
this coin do I have to run this

929
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,480
algorithm given some probability of it

930
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,720
succeeding that's P how many times do I

931
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,599
have to keep going until I get a

932
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:36,720
successful answer lots of other uh

933
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:39,280
examples we will get to them in a moment

934
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,880
um now our traditional approach to

935
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,119
solving tough problems like this is to

936
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,880
draw a tree in this case the tree is

937
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,400
infinite so that's going to be a little

938
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:52,599
harder to draw we have uh P versus one

939
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,440
minus P whenever we get ahe heads uh we

940
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:57,400
stop but this tree keeps going off to

941
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,160
the right

942
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,880
okay so that's uh maybe let's not look

943
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:05,880
at the infinite tree uh let's use some

944
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,880
formulas

945
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:12,079
so I'm going to call this number the

946
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:14,160
number of flips I'm going to call F and

947
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,640
then we want to compute remember f is a

948
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:20,160
function so uh there are various

949
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:22,359
outcomes here which correspond to um you

950
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,880
know the executions various numbers of

951
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:27,680
flips it's going to be tals taals taals

952
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,119
taals tals I times and then heads those

953
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,559
are the various outcomes that could

954
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,480
happen because we stop whenever we get a

955
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:36,000
heads so it could be zero tails and then

956
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,559
heads one Tails then heads and so on uh

957
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,319
so that's our sample space and then f is

958
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,760
a function that maps that sample space

959
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,800
to count how many total flips were there

960
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,040
head anails so it's always going to be

961
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,839
at least one and then expect so f is a

962
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:54,200
function can take on some integer value

963
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:56,280
between zero and uh one I guess and

964
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,720
infinity um and now we're going to

965
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,440
reduce this to a single SLE number via

966
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,480
expectation what is the average number

967
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:07,040
of flips that we expect to take so uh

968
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,839
that's expectation of f now we will use

969
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,559
our latest and greatest

970
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:13,640
formula this

971
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:17,520
one let me memorize it for a second it's

972
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,520
just sum of X greater than

973
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,480
I already forgotten it it's too far from

974
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:31,920
over there to over here uh was it

975
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:34,760
probability f is greater than I I hope

976
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:39,160
yes okay so this is that

977
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:42,920
CDF and I claim uh this is not too hard

978
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:44,680
to figure out using what we know because

979
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,599
uh we're assuming each each flip is

980
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,240
independent from subsequent flips like

981
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:50,240
the the flips of this coin are mutually

982
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,440
independent it's not some magical coin

983
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,640
that always comes up heads or always

984
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,839
comes up with Tails or something well

985
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,599
that would be represented by the P but

986
00:45:54,839 --> 00:46:03,559
there's no correlation between the

987
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:06,680
the different flips so um for the for

988
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:08,960
there to be at least are greater than ey

989
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,839
flips before I get a heads that means

990
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,079
that the first eye flips are Tails these

991
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:20,200
are equivalent events this is this this

992
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:23,359
F greater than I is the same as

993
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:28,480
first I

994
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:29,800
flips are tails

995
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,480
right and then after that I don't know

996
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,920
might get a heads right away then f is

997
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,720
i+ one or it might take longer but F

998
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,040
being greater than an i is exactly this

999
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,119
situation so what is the probability

1000
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,119
that the first eye flips our

1001
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,280
Tails one minus P to the I I saw you

1002
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:49,280
Whispering

1003
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:57,079
it feel like H yeah cool now the hard

1004
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,640
part is working out this sum or remember

1005
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:01,480
ing what this sum is right this is a

1006
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,880
geometric sum right so 1us P to the I

1007
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,400
because this is a chance of getting a

1008
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,000
taals and then they're each independent

1009
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,440
so we just take the product by a product

1010
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:14,240
rule uh this is a geometric thing sum of

1011
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:19,760
x to the I from uh I equal 0 to Infinity

1012
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:23,760
is 1 over 1 - x so this is 1 over 1us X

1013
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:26,520
here is 1 - P so 1 - 1 minus P that's

1014
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,359
also known as P so this whole thing is 1

1015
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:31,839
over p key amazingly simple

1016
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,200
formula for the meantime to failure this

1017
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,640
is why meantime to failure is such a

1018
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,440
famous example because it has such a

1019
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,720
beautiful solution so if I'm flipping a

1020
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:43,160
Fair coin

1021
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:47,000
50/50 p is a half I expect to have to

1022
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:50,440
flip it twice to get a heads or tails

1023
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,400
now reality is not equal to the average

1024
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,599
sadly so I had to flip seven times to

1025
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,160
get a heads or tails uh but you know if

1026
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,280
I was gaming for heads it would be very

1027
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:04,040
fast it happened the very first step uh

1028
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,240
so that's um that's the expectation okay

1029
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:09,319
it doesn't tell you everything about the

1030
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,319
distribution this distribution has a

1031
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:17,720
name alluded to by this uh geometric

1032
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,559
Series this was the

1033
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:23,559
CDF uh we call this the geometric

1034
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,559
distribution

1035
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:37,000
it comes up somewhat frequently in real

1036
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:39,119
life

1037
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,119
distributions if I were to write down

1038
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:46,440
the the pmf it's uh 1 minus P to the I

1039
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:50,359
times P this chance that I get ey tails

1040
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:52,960
and then a heads that's uh well okay

1041
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:57,359
it's either that or probability the way

1042
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,599
I defined it before it was FAL I + 1

1043
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,720
so one of these is true pick one these

1044
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,079
are both called the geometric

1045
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,599
distribution if you look at the

1046
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,839
Wikipedia definition of geometric

1047
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,000
distribution it says there are two

1048
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:08,440
distributions called geometric

1049
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,359
distribution this one and this one so

1050
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:16,359
pick your poison

1051
00:49:10,359 --> 00:49:18,160
uh both are called that uh so here is an

1052
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:21,000
application another application of

1053
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,559
meantime to failure uh I don't know

1054
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,480
about you but I like collecting

1055
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:27,880
things Everyone likes collecting

1056
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:30,680
something right the the to me the

1057
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,480
epitome of collecting things is gotcha

1058
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:33,760
oh that's the video game version of gcha

1059
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,559
where you're collecting characters in a

1060
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:40,000
video game uh please do not play these

1061
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:42,200
games they're annoyingly addictive uh I

1062
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,960
spend most of my nights these days uh

1063
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:47,480
but the gacha is named after this notion

1064
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:51,920
of uh you can see it in the top right

1065
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:54,400
there is H gasa pan which is like uh

1066
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,880
these these little um you know if you

1067
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,079
grew up in the US you have uh vend

1068
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,599
machines that give you candy well these

1069
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:04,240
are like the really cool vending

1070
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:07,680
machines in Japan this was a gachaan

1071
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,920
festival and uh you pick your favorite

1072
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,079
weird thing that you can get in a little

1073
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,960
ball out of this machine you put in your

1074
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:18,599
200 yen and you get a randomly selected

1075
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:21,119
ball from those sets of uh weird toys so

1076
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:23,920
this is like a toy delivery or not

1077
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:25,880
delivery service it's a toy uh random

1078
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,240
selection service and if you want to

1079
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:31,280
collect all the different things on this

1080
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,760
list how many times you have to do it

1081
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,319
this is a problem called coupon

1082
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:38,119
collectors or the gotcha problem I would

1083
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:39,880
say uh but uh we'll solve it in general

1084
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:42,920
in recitation

1085
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,799
tomorrow uh but I'll solve a very simple

1086
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:49,160
version here which is a nice

1087
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:49,160
application of

1088
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,640
this of meantime to failure

1089
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,720
let's solve the special case where there

1090
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,720
are only two

1091
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:11,319
toys gotcha gacha is a sound that when

1092
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:14,599
you crank the things like gacha gacha

1093
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:17,400
gacha PA is when the ball drops

1094
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:21,280
down uh gotcha

1095
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:23,799
with two toys or characters or whatever

1096
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,960
you're collecting uh and so you get a

1097
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:29,680
random Choice say let's say it's 50/50

1098
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,040
between the two so in your first pull is

1099
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:33,599
what we usually call these at least in

1100
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,319
the video game context or first crank in

1101
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,839
the physical context uh you get one of

1102
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:40,760
the

1103
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:42,280
toys okay so now it's really just how

1104
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,680
many steps do I need until I get the

1105
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,520
second

1106
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:51,920
toy two this is the coin flipping

1107
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,920
problem so how many more

1108
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:57,880
PS

1109
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:59,880
until uh

1110
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,559
you get a distinct

1111
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:08,200
toy and in this case it's going to be

1112
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:10,599
50/50 each each pull and so uh you

1113
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:13,680
expect two

1114
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:16,040
more uh which is a total of

1115
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,000
three now when you have K toys you want

1116
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,200
to collect it's annoying because in the

1117
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,599
beginning it's really easy to get lots

1118
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,480
of distinct toys because you're very

1119
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,400
likely but when you're trying to collect

1120
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,880
the last toy it's very unlikely that you

1121
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,839
pull the last toy because there's only

1122
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,760
like a one ink chance that you get it so

1123
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:33,559
you end up with some harmonic series you

1124
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:37,119
get a log Factor you'll see that

1125
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:39,720
tomorrow okay uh let's do a little more

1126
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,880
Theory and then some more examples where

1127
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,880
should I

1128
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,880
goas

1129
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:51,960
gambling I feel like I should have a

1130
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,520
disclaimer please don't gamble uh it's

1131
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,520
not good for you

1132
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,359
please just uh simulate gambling that's

1133
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:11,160
better I was writing a simulation uh of

1134
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,119
of this game this morning to see like

1135
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,720
what were my chances of actually winning

1136
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:19,280
despite the odds being against my favor

1137
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:21,079
and with 10 Rounds uh I had like a 20%

1138
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,960
chance of winning so luckily the demo

1139
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:25,280
went in my favor but there was a decent

1140
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,079
chance that I could have won even though

1141
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,920
the expectation was

1142
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:32,319
against

1143
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,319
me so it

1144
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:50,760
go if there is one thing in this class

1145
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,680
that you remember about probability I

1146
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:55,640
suggest linearity of expectation it is

1147
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,760
simultaneously the coolest thing in my

1148
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:01,240
opinion about probability and the most

1149
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:04,440
useful thing for solving problems

1150
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:08,640
so what is it uh the expectation

1151
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:10,240
function is linear let me formalize um

1152
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,000
suppose you have two random variables X

1153
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:15,520
and Y and you take their sum and then

1154
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,520
you take their expectation turns out

1155
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,680
that equals the expectation the sum of

1156
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,680
the

1157
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:28,920
expectations okay uh or uh if you take a

1158
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:33,040
random variable and you multiply it by a

1159
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:35,920
constant uh you can pull that constant

1160
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:40,119
out and so more generally this is the

1161
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:46,240
full linearity form if I have

1162
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:49,520
a where am I here some I = 1 to n of c i

1163
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:51,599
* x i this

1164
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:56,799
is uh the

1165
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:59,200
sum I = 1 to n of c i * the expected

1166
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:59,200
value of

1167
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,280
XI okay uh it takes almost longer to

1168
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,520
write it down than to prove it I mean

1169
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:10,319
it's actually not hard to prove um you

1170
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,240
if you stare at this definition enough

1171
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:14,040
um it's because this is a linear

1172
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,440
function right if you look at how it

1173
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,880
depends on the X's it's a linear

1174
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:21,240
function in in X you've got some

1175
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:24,599
constant weights I mean they depend on

1176
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:26,319
your probability setup but if you mess

1177
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:27,680
around with X and don't mess around with

1178
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:30,520
with your sample space or its

1179
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:33,920
probabilities then uh this is just a sum

1180
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:35,599
of constants times uh X applied to

1181
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,920
things so in particular if I replace X

1182
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:40,720
here with X Plus Y and I just Jam that

1183
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,000
into the sum I can split this into two

1184
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,839
sums and lo and behold I get expectation

1185
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,480
of X Plus expectation of Y and these

1186
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:47,680
other things follow in the same way so I

1187
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,280
won't write down a proof there's one in

1188
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:53,240
the notes if you want to look uh so it's

1189
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,760
almost an obvious thing once you once I

1190
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,920
tell it to you but it's extremely

1191
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:00,119
powerful

1192
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:02,559
um mainly because it has no

1193
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:06,480
conditions you don't

1194
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,480
need that the XI are

1195
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,480
independent you don't need that they're

1196
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:14,400
disjoint you don't need anything except

1197
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,960
that they are uh functions over the same

1198
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,640
sample space I guess that's the one

1199
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:21,799
assumption you need uh compare this with

1200
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:24,799
remember uh like there's the product

1201
00:56:21,799 --> 00:56:24,799
rule

1202
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:37,200
this only works if a and b are

1203
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:37,200
independent or there's the sum

1204
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,240
rule we use these all the time but you

1205
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:45,039
have to be very careful when you use

1206
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,520
them you have to check are those really

1207
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:51,000
independent uh for the sum rule it only

1208
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,000
works if a and b are

1209
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:55,200
disjoint so like when we do law of total

1210
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:58,000
probability we're using this all the

1211
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,520
time but but uh you have to be very

1212
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,280
careful that you use it correctly

1213
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,520
whereas linearity of expectation you

1214
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,359
don't need to be careful other than

1215
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:12,000
making sure you define your random

1216
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:12,000
variables well okay let's um Let's do an

1217
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:20,319
example common one in games gambling

1218
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:24,160
games and other games uh dice games

1219
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:30,240
let's say we roll two

1220
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:30,240
Fair uh two side oh sorry six-sided

1221
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:39,839
dice what is the expected value of the

1222
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,079
sum well uh the expected value of the

1223
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:50,599
sum is the expected value of the

1224
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:53,799
individual Parts let let me rewrite this

1225
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:56,559
as a instead of words let's use some

1226
00:57:53,799 --> 00:57:58,160
notation let's say D1 is the ren that

1227
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:01,160
just gives me what is the value of the

1228
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,880
first ey and D2 is the random variable

1229
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:04,359
that gives me what's the second value

1230
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,319
the sample space here is a pair an

1231
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:08,359
ordered pair of first die comma second

1232
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:10,520
die so this extracts the first part and

1233
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:13,079
this extracts the second part the

1234
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:17,200
expected value of the sum by linearity

1235
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:17,200
of expectation is the sum of the

1236
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,400
expectations and we already did this

1237
00:58:19,799 --> 00:58:26,240
example right this was

1238
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:29,119
3.5 uh 3.5

1239
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:32,559
so to total is

1240
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,680
seven easy and what's cool is this

1241
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,760
didn't even need that the dice were

1242
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,319
independent you could glue the dice

1243
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,119
together so that they always roll

1244
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:42,240
together as long as that doesn't change

1245
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:44,280
the probabilities of the outcomes which

1246
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,160
maybe a little questionable with gluing

1247
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,079
but imagine I don't know they're they're

1248
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,680
quantumly entangled and however I roll

1249
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:53,079
this die the other one comes out the

1250
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:54,680
same way this will still be true it

1251
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:56,760
changes the distribution but it does not

1252
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:59,119
change the expectation

1253
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,119
which is

1254
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:04,440
cool all right so we just needed the

1255
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,559
probabilities of each outcome were equal

1256
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,559
to get the

1257
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:08,559
3.5

1258
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:16,839
question gluing dice together uh I I'm

1259
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:19,000
imagining like if you if I take two dice

1260
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:23,000
I glue them together then when I roll

1261
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,280
them when I roll that unit uh whichever

1262
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,000
however the first die comes up it forces

1263
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,480
the other one to come up in a particular

1264
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,119
orientation right so they're they're

1265
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:34,880
literally tied together so that the the

1266
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:37,319
D1 determines D2 if they're glued

1267
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,680
together but this formula applies in

1268
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:40,760
that situation provided it's still

1269
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:44,520
equally likely that you get one two

1270
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,520
three four five or six for each die

1271
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,400
individually okay it's maybe a little

1272
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,960
clear with coins if I glue two coins

1273
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,760
together then whichever one comes up

1274
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:56,799
heads the other one also comes up heads

1275
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,240
or comes up tails

1276
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:59,760
depending if I glue the head sides

1277
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:02,200
together or heads to

1278
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:05,599
tails all

1279
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:09,599
right uh

1280
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,599
so I want to do more cool

1281
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:16,640
examples and they illustrate how to use

1282
01:00:13,799 --> 01:00:16,640
linearity of

1283
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,880
expectation uh with

1284
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:26,160
it like the the key to using linearity

1285
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:28,200
of expectation is this technique

1286
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:31,280
if you want to compute the expectation

1287
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:33,799
of some random variable uh decompose

1288
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,799
that random

1289
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:40,200
variable

1290
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:40,200
into uh a

1291
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,319
sum

1292
01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:46,640
of

1293
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:49,240
other random variables possibly

1294
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:51,799
indicator random

1295
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:53,480
variables okay you see it here already I

1296
01:00:51,799 --> 01:00:54,880
mean we said what's the expectation of

1297
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:56,559
the sum well let's decompose that into

1298
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,280
the first die and the second

1299
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,559
and then the sum is the first one plus

1300
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,240
the second one and then we could split

1301
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,720
it up using linearity of expectation and

1302
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,240
then compute each of these individually

1303
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:08,200
instead of having to look at the giant

1304
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,760
sample space which is the pairs of di

1305
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:12,000
rolls

1306
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,400
okay

1307
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,400
so

1308
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,880
uh this is a technique we're going to

1309
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:24,039
use now several times whatever remains

1310
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:24,039
our time so first example

1311
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:01,359
so previously we analyzed how many times

1312
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:06,119
do I flip a biased coin until I get a

1313
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:08,119
heads uh now let's suppose I want two

1314
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:10,559
heads natural

1315
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:14,039
generalization uh this seems quite a bit

1316
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,520
harder because you keep flipping and

1317
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:16,880
then at some point you get the first

1318
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,160
heads you keep flipping at some point

1319
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,960
you get the second

1320
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:23,480
heads okay well that sounds kind of like

1321
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:26,079
two steps there's how many times do I

1322
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:27,680
flip until I get the first head and then

1323
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,920
how many more times I have to flip until

1324
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,640
I get the second heads both of those

1325
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,440
problems sound like meantime to failure

1326
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,279
so let's write that out carefully with

1327
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,880
random

1328
01:02:36,279 --> 01:02:42,400
variables so uh let's call this number

1329
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:49,039
of flips

1330
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:51,240
F then uh F equal fub1 plus

1331
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:54,319
F2

1332
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:56,559
where uh

1333
01:02:54,319 --> 01:03:01,160
F1 is

1334
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:05,279
the number of flips from the beginning

1335
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:05,279
until uh we get the first

1336
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:11,520
head and

1337
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:16,799
F2 is the number of

1338
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:16,799
flips starting after the first

1339
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:23,440
head

1340
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:26,559
until uh the second

1341
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:31,039
head okay so to be precise the sample

1342
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:34,760
space here is um strings of H's and

1343
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:37,559
T's where there's exactly two hes and

1344
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:39,119
the last character is an H right because

1345
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:41,200
I keep flipping heads Tails heads Tails

1346
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:44,240
heads Tails until I get the second H

1347
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,760
then I stop so that's my sample space

1348
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:49,119
and F1 is just counting how many flips

1349
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:51,839
are there up to including the first head

1350
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,720
and F2 is counting how many flips are

1351
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:55,200
there starting right after the first

1352
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,520
head and counting up to and including

1353
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,400
the second head which is the end of the

1354
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:01,680
string so together F1 and F2 count the

1355
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:05,839
total number of flips

1356
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:07,480
right but crucially uh F1 and F2 if you

1357
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:09,079
think about it are exactly the meantime

1358
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:11,200
to failure

1359
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:13,279
problems uh because they were counting I

1360
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,520
mean F1 is most obvious it's how many

1361
01:04:13,279 --> 01:04:20,720
flips do I get do I do until the first

1362
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,720
head so uh we know

1363
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:28,119
here the expected Val value of

1364
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:32,359
f is the sum of the

1365
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:42,039
expectations F1 is almost literally the

1366
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:46,839
definition of meantime to failure so

1367
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:48,599
it's uh one over p in expectation F2 if

1368
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:50,520
you think about it a little bit you this

1369
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:52,160
is the same experiment but starting

1370
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,480
after the first heads and because all

1371
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,279
the flips are independent it doesn't

1372
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,079
matter what happened before now it's

1373
01:04:55,279 --> 01:04:59,039
still going to be the same

1374
01:04:57,079 --> 01:05:03,039
situation uh for

1375
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:06,400
F2 and so the expectation is 2

1376
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:08,760
p almost as simple and in general if I

1377
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,760
want K

1378
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:15,240
heads then uh the expect expected number

1379
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:18,880
flips I need to do is K Over P by

1380
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:21,200
linearity of expectation beautiful so

1381
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,039
simple

1382
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,279
okay

1383
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,640
uh let's do another coin flipping

1384
01:05:25,279 --> 01:05:27,640
example

1385
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,880
so here I stopped the experiment when I

1386
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:39,960
got a desired number of heads what if I

1387
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:42,079
just flip a coin n times no matter what

1388
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:44,279
I always flip end times how many heads

1389
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:50,839
do I expect to

1390
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:50,839
get that's kind of the Dual problem

1391
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:07,000
what do I want to do uh let's do biased

1392
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:07,000
again and biased coins again

1393
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,480
independent

1394
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:23,720
uh let H be the number of heads in those

1395
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,160
end coin flips we can rewrite this as a

1396
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:30,119
sum

1397
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:33,000
of n indicator random variables where hi

1398
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:38,640
is uh indicator random

1399
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:38,640
variable uh for the I

1400
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,440
coin uh coming up

1401
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:57,039
heads okay uh so expected value of H by

1402
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:59,839
linearity is the sum of the expected

1403
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:59,839
values of the

1404
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,520
hi okay but the coins are all identical

1405
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,119
because they're independent and they

1406
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:11,440
have the same bias I didn't mention it

1407
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:13,880
but we're supposing again probability of

1408
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,880
heads is

1409
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:21,799
p uh so what's the so uh this is just

1410
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:25,000
going to be n times the expectation of

1411
01:07:21,799 --> 01:07:26,559
hi because they all behave the same and

1412
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,799
what's the expectation of

1413
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:30,279
hi we work that out over here if you

1414
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:32,960
have an indicator random variable the

1415
01:07:30,279 --> 01:07:35,640
expectation of hi is the probability

1416
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,119
that it equals one so the probability of

1417
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,799
the event which here was the probability

1418
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:46,359
of heads so that's just

1419
01:07:39,799 --> 01:07:49,520
P so this is n * probability h i = 1

1420
01:07:46,359 --> 01:07:54,200
which is n * P okay

1421
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:56,279
maybe obvious but

1422
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,960
uh yeah we didn't even need that these

1423
01:07:56,279 --> 01:08:01,559
were independent that's where it's less

1424
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:04,680
obvious right it just it all we need is

1425
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:06,960
that for each coin the probability of it

1426
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:09,640
coming up heads is

1427
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,079
p but it could be all the coins always

1428
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:13,799
flip the same they're always all heads

1429
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:16,440
or all Tails but heads with probability

1430
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:18,880
P or it could be they're independent

1431
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:20,480
these are different setups but the

1432
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,839
expected number of heads will in all

1433
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:27,440
cases will be n * P by linearity of

1434
01:08:23,839 --> 01:08:27,440
expectation so that's pretty cool

1435
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:39,000
uh you can do a similar trick for did I

1436
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:41,359
erase it the hearts problem I think I

1437
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,359
erased

1438
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:48,920
it yeah

1439
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:53,159
um I'll just tell you briefly so with

1440
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:56,799
the hearts you can say the number of

1441
01:08:53,159 --> 01:08:59,080
Hearts is a sum

1442
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:02,440
of

1443
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:05,640
13 different indicator random variables

1444
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:11,880
heart I is

1445
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:11,880
um is the E Heart Card

1446
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:16,839
chosen again this is a setup where we

1447
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,719
have 52 cards we choose three without

1448
01:09:16,839 --> 01:09:20,679
replacement and I want to know how many

1449
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:23,679
hearts there are so this is number of

1450
01:09:20,679 --> 01:09:27,040
hearts and this is just did I choose the

1451
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:28,960
I Heart Card in this setup so of course

1452
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:32,319
the number of Hearts is exactly the sum

1453
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:35,239
of uh one for every heart card that I

1454
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:37,319
chose uh so one one this is like Ace and

1455
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:39,400
this is King and we got all the ones in

1456
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:41,799
between so this is whereas here was the

1457
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:44,719
I coin flip or whatever here's the I

1458
01:09:41,799 --> 01:09:48,199
heart that we potentially choose and the

1459
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:51,199
probability of choosing a given heart

1460
01:09:48,199 --> 01:09:55,760
is is easy it's

1461
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:58,480
uh it's not so easy it's some some small

1462
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:01,040
expression uh it could be you choose it

1463
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:03,920
in the first step or you don't choose it

1464
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:06,640
in the first step uh but then you choose

1465
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:09,199
it in the Second

1466
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,719
Step uh or you don't choose it in the

1467
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:13,239
Second

1468
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:16,000
Step uh and then you'd have to choose it

1469
01:10:13,239 --> 01:10:19,800
in the third step those are the three

1470
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,520
ways you can get it and

1471
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:27,120
conveniently all the hard numbers here

1472
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:27,120
cancel this is exciting

1473
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:35,880
and you

1474
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:35,880
get uh 2 over 52 3 over 52 I can

1475
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:44,880
count uh so you add them up uh 13 of

1476
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:47,159
them and then so you get 13 * 3 over 52

1477
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,159
and that's

1478
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:55,440
3/4 so kind of

1479
01:10:51,520 --> 01:11:00,320
nice no binomial coefficients required

1480
01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:00,320
all right uh one more pair of

1481
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:19,960
examples I have in my notes that this is

1482
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:24,040
a situation that H happens in all of us

1483
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:26,480
are dead which is a great uh zombie High

1484
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:28,840
School TV show

1485
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,800
uh I imagine it just happens in lots of

1486
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:32,360
schools but I never went to school so I

1487
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,840
don't know if you can tell me whether

1488
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:35,840
this is the case probably less so in the

1489
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:49,360
US maybe l so when you're older maybe

1490
01:11:47,639 --> 01:11:50,560
when you're young and you still and you

1491
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:52,360
have a phone you have to submit your

1492
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,840
phone when you arrive at school and

1493
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:56,159
here's the weird part and this is maybe

1494
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:58,280
only in a zombie scenario uh at the end

1495
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:00,400
of the day phones are returned uniformly

1496
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,400
at

1497
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:09,280
random I hope this didn't happen to you

1498
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:12,679
uh how many people get the right

1499
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,679
phone natural

1500
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:20,960
question you care about whether you get

1501
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,159
your phone that's also true that's a

1502
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:25,840
closely we're going to have to solve

1503
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:25,840
that problem in fact

1504
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:33,320
okay so assuming here each there's a one

1505
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,719
toone correspondence between phones and

1506
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:38,520
people no

1507
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:41,520
ownership um so the number of kids that

1508
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:45,719
get their own phone is uh we can write

1509
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:49,280
as a sum over all kids we had n kids so

1510
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:54,520
k k for kid one up to n of the

1511
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:57,120
probability that kid K Kid K gets their

1512
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,120
phone

1513
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,239
okay I'm just writing this because I've

1514
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,880
pre preworked out these examples of

1515
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:05,679
course when you're solving them you'll

1516
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,440
probably know in this part of the class

1517
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:10,159
that you should use this technique

1518
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:12,040
always if you asked for an expectation

1519
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:14,000
probably you might need to decompose the

1520
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:15,719
random variable into sums of other

1521
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,159
random variables you might not have to

1522
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:19,320
like this heart problem we solved in two

1523
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:21,159
different ways but if you can it's going

1524
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:23,440
to be easier so I encourage you to try

1525
01:13:21,159 --> 01:13:25,120
to do this but how do you decompose into

1526
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,880
some random variables I mean that's

1527
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,199
divine inspiration you just got to try a

1528
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,440
bunch of things until you find something

1529
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:32,639
that works you that gives you think

1530
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:34,400
about what you know how to compute and

1531
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:37,440
then try to build it up or think about

1532
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,560
how to decompose top down whatever uh

1533
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:42,520
but as binmore said what I care about is

1534
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:44,480
whether I get my phone and I'm kid seven

1535
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:47,600
I don't know uh what's the probability

1536
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:49,880
kid seven gets their phone or kid one or

1537
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,800
whatever it turns out they're all the

1538
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,719
same

1539
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:57,159
because uh

1540
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:59,000
oh yeah prob I I I sort of did two steps

1541
01:13:57,159 --> 01:14:02,560
here right this is how many kids get

1542
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:07,239
their phone we can call this uh X and

1543
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:09,159
this is going to be um the sum sorry I I

1544
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:13,639
skipped way too many steps here the

1545
01:14:09,159 --> 01:14:16,600
expectation of X is going to be

1546
01:14:13,639 --> 01:14:18,960
this uh and but the number of kids that

1547
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:24,480
get their phone is going to be equal to

1548
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:26,280
the sum of XK equal 1 to n where XK is

1549
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:29,639
uh an IND or random

1550
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:35,920
variable uh for

1551
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:35,920
whether uh Kid K got their

1552
01:14:39,159 --> 01:14:43,639
phone okay this is important because

1553
01:14:41,639 --> 01:14:45,320
this was a random variable so I if I'm

1554
01:14:43,639 --> 01:14:48,000
going to write equals I should have some

1555
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:49,679
random variables over there when I wrote

1556
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,440
a probability that means I'm working

1557
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:53,600
with a number and so that means the best

1558
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:55,880
I'm hoping for is the expectation okay

1559
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,520
so this first equation I wrote is wrong

1560
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:59,679
please do not do that in your homework

1561
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,159
it's easy to do as you can see but if

1562
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:03,280
you you should first set up the random

1563
01:15:01,159 --> 01:15:05,400
variables which are functions decompose

1564
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,719
them into sums of other functions and

1565
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:09,080
then say okay let's compute the

1566
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:12,040
expectation use linearity of expectation

1567
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:14,480
this is equal to this uh by linearity

1568
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:17,280
the sum of the expectations of the

1569
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:19,080
XIs and then by the properties of

1570
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:20,520
indicator Rand variables the expected

1571
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,560
value of an indicator ROM variable is

1572
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:25,320
the probability of that

1573
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:28,800
event okay

1574
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:30,360
so then what's the probability that kid

1575
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,760
K gets their

1576
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:34,679
phone well how many different

1577
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:38,000
distributions are there of the end

1578
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:38,000
phones help me

1579
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,360
out n n great

1580
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:53,000
answer n different ways there's n

1581
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:56,920
different possibilities for the first

1582
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,920
kid to get their phone back

1583
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,239
and

1584
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:06,560
then factorial yeah there's n factorial

1585
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:08,920
different distributions of the phones

1586
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:13,000
that's I said oh oh you said n really

1587
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:15,560
loud which is n factorial thank you bad

1588
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:17,080
pun uh so that's the denominator right

1589
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:18,639
those are the all the

1590
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:22,080
possible

1591
01:16:18,639 --> 01:16:25,320
uh all the possible rearrangements of

1592
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:28,000
the phones to the kids and very

1593
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:30,080
emphatically uh and then how many are

1594
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,560
there where Kid K gets their phone well

1595
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,280
this is easy right this is just saying

1596
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:36,280
well Kid K gets their phone and then

1597
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:37,800
among all the other n minus one phones

1598
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:39,159
they're whatever they are how many

1599
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:43,760
different ways are there to distribute

1600
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:43,760
those phones n minus

1601
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:51,639
one hopefully I didn't max out the

1602
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:54,280
mic okay n minus one factorial Over N

1603
01:16:51,639 --> 01:16:56,320
factorial oh my gosh such big factorials

1604
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:58,920
but basically everything cancels and

1605
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,920
this is 1 over

1606
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:06,000
n okay 1/ n summed n

1607
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:10,760
times that's

1608
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:11,920
one one ah one kid expects to get their

1609
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:14,040
phone

1610
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:17,520
back

1611
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,520
okay hopefully it's

1612
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:22,440
bmore Who's the I mean it doesn't mean

1613
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:25,159
that one person will get get their phone

1614
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:29,440
back maybe none of them do here's a Rel

1615
01:17:25,159 --> 01:17:33,679
game suppose uh n

1616
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:35,760
diners uh put their

1617
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:41,320
phones put

1618
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:43,840
their phone singular uh on a

1619
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:45,679
turntable sometimes call the Lazy Susan

1620
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:50,199
for Distributing

1621
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:52,080
food if you're eating family style and

1622
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:56,840
uh then you spin the

1623
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:56,840
table spin uniformly at random

1624
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:08,280
uh and then you take the phone in front

1625
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:08,280
of

1626
01:18:09,239 --> 01:18:14,560
you let's assume that this is a discreet

1627
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,679
table so when you spin it there's only n

1628
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,800
different rotations that could come out

1629
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:20,040
and so there's always a phone

1630
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:22,360
immediately in front of you this is a

1631
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:24,560
different way to be terrible with

1632
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,920
phones in this one you know anything

1633
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:28,440
could happen it could be no one gets

1634
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,719
their phone back that's maybe it's not

1635
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,840
quite what you expect you expect one

1636
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:32,280
person to get their phone back or it

1637
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,000
could be everyone gets exactly their

1638
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,560
phone back if you do it randomly

1639
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,239
anything's possible it's just a one over

1640
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:40,840
n factorial chance that any particular

1641
01:18:37,239 --> 01:18:42,679
outcome happens uh here it's actually

1642
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:45,560
guaranteed either everyone gets their

1643
01:18:42,679 --> 01:18:47,360
phone back or no one does right because

1644
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,639
if I rotate by zero then everyone gets

1645
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,719
their phone back if I rotate by any

1646
01:18:48,639 --> 01:18:52,960
other amount then everyone gets a

1647
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:55,159
different phone so it's a different

1648
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:58,960
distribution it's a different

1649
01:18:55,159 --> 01:18:59,880
probability setup but the expectation is

1650
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,080
the

1651
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:08,320
same expected number

1652
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:10,679
of uh matching people phones whatever

1653
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,679
matching

1654
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:16,679
phones it's still one here it's really

1655
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:19,320
easy to compute because there are only n

1656
01:19:16,679 --> 01:19:24,320
different outcomes and in one of those

1657
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:25,440
scenarios uh you get um so one over n

1658
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:28,120
chance

1659
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,159
everyone gets their phone back and in

1660
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:32,199
all other

1661
01:19:29,159 --> 01:19:34,520
scenarios no one gets their phone back

1662
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:37,639
so that disappears you get one over n *

1663
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:40,360
n you get one that's sort of the by the

1664
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:42,159
definition of expectation how to compute

1665
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,400
this but you can also set it up in

1666
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:45,760
exactly the same way you can say well

1667
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:47,080
you could sum over all the diners and

1668
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,880
check what's the probability that a

1669
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:50,920
particular Diner gets their phone back

1670
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:53,040
but now you don't have to do this n nus

1671
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:56,080
one factorial Over N factorial it's just

1672
01:19:53,040 --> 01:20:00,400
one over n by the setup was this term

1673
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:02,600
here so this is also the uh

1674
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:04,560
probability of

1675
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:06,600
XI and so you can also do it with

1676
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,480
linearity of expectation so this is a

1677
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:10,400
funny scenario where I have two rather

1678
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:12,120
different setups for redistributing

1679
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,960
phones they have very different

1680
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:16,280
behaviors but in expectation they're the

1681
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:17,960
same so expectation doesn't tell you

1682
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,679
everything about the distribution and in

1683
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:21,639
the next couple of lectures we'll talk

1684
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:23,639
more about understanding the rest of the

1685
01:20:21,639 --> 01:20:27,840
distribution Beyond just the

1686
01:20:23,639 --> 01:20:27,840
mean all right
