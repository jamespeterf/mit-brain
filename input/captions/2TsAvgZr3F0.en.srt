startup exchange but first i'm going to

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,160
give a brief overview of our program and

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,160
I hope you find it all

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,080
useful so MIT startup exchange was

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,759
created about close to 10 years ago now

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,120
within the office of MIT corporate

13
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:35,280
relations to support MIT connected

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,800
startups as they grow expand and help

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,000
solve some of the world's greatest

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,719
challenges and we do this by fostering

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,920
Partnerships and collaborations between

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,559
the startups and Industry primarily

19
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,079
members of the MIT industrial Ison

20
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,039
program or ILP represented by so many of

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,280
you here today and also the MIT

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,920
Innovation ecosystem and Beyond the

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,680
startups in our program have a very um

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,519
strong connection to the Institute and

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,000
they can be based on MIT licens

26
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,159
technology or founded by MIT faculty

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,560
staff or alumni and they can also be

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,280
vetted by some of our MIT peers

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,280
including the engine start Nano and Cale

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,640
startup connect

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,560
plus we have around a thousand startups

32
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,759
in the program and they usually join at

33
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,439
Pilot stage or Beyond and they can cover

34
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,439
any sector and any geography here you

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,360
can see some of the trending

36
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,000
Technologies of MIT startups and I've

37
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,799
noted in bold those represented by those

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,680
presenting to you today of course

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,799
starting with AI ml

40
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,799
also big data and analytics energy

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,920
storage and sustainability Robotics and

42
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:41,040
Healthcare and life

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,680
science so when it comes to Value

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,640
everything that we do is to support the

45
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,399
startups present opportunities where

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,520
they can share their Technologies and

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,320
solutions and connect with industry and

48
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,880
so the Partnerships that can develop out

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,039
of that or collaborations ultimately

50
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,439
result in success cases like the one

51
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,560
highlighted here and we do this in a

52
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,039
variety of ways it's a very customized

53
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,680
and curated approach and I hope that

54
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,160
everyone can be taking advantage of all

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,520
of these benefits so for example we

56
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,239
launch calls for startups we call these

57
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,120
opportunities and they're based on

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,440
corporate's priorities and internal

59
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,840
challenges and startups can apply on our

60
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,360
website and if selected they can work

61
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,040
with you as an ILP member to help you

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,560
solve a problem that you may be may be

63
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,760
facing in your industry we also have

64
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,640
oneone meetings and events including

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,200
demo days like today or other webinars

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,480
or conferences where there startup

67
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,720
linning talks and Exhibits or many

68
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,959
opportunities for engagement we also

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,040
host workshops and trainings sometimes

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:46,480
in connection with our MIT

71
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,360
peers and so what is demo day it's a

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,239
virtual Forum that we host every couple

73
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,959
of months now to facilitate interactions

00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,720
between the startups and Industry and we

75
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,440
hope that this can happen sooner rather

76
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,159
than later so it's sort of a short and

77
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,480
