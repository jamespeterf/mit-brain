1
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,720
Yeah. Next up, we'll welcome to the

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,160
stage Nicholas Fry, who is the thermal

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,160
energy networks market lead for Jacobs.

4
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,680
All right. Uh, good morning everybody.

5
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,680
Uh, as mentioned, I'm the thermal energy

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,760
networks market lead for Jacobs in North

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,239
America. So, I primarily deal with, uh,

8
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,680
district energy systems, uh, ambient

9
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,760
temperature loops, things of that

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,760
nature. Single building systems is

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,280
something that I consult on every once

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,879
in a while, but we have other design

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,199
teams for that generally speaking. So I

14
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,840
will go through uh some basic

15
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,000
differences. I think it's hard to follow

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,600
uh Connor for a better introduction to

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,960
ground source heat pump systems for

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,760
standalone building systems. But uh this

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,320
should give you an idea of when we

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:16,320
transition to networks, the advantages

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,960
uh that we can harness uh and use to

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,560
optimize uh our building heating and

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,479
cooling systems across large scales. So

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,799
citycale systems, regional scale

25
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,119
systems, neighborhood is easy in my

26
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,400
opinion. Um so back to the basics just a

27
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,840
little bit. I'm sorry I wasn't here

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,079
yesterday. Hopefully you got a little

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,240
bit of this. There are different

30
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,479
completion types for vertical ground

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,880
heat exchangers that are important in

32
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,840
considerations when we're thinking about

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,799
a utility scale product. Right? So this

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,600
has to be something that is uh less

35
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,680
capital intensive and can be paid for

36
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,560
over the duration of the system

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,799
operation. Typically uh a utility wants

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,880
to look at a 30 to 50 year time scale.

39
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,240
Gas networks they go out to 70-year

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,240
projections. Uh so we want to make sure

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,200
that we reduce the capital costs at the

42
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,760
beginning. Uh the typical ground source

43
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,080
completion in the United States right

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,280
now is conductive closed loop vertical

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,000
systems. Those are actually uh capital

46
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,879
cost intensive by comparison to openloop

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,239
systems. Of course, you're you're uh

48
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,040
leveraging uh a reduction in operations

49
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,440
and maintenance costs by using the

50
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,760
closed loop systems

51
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,080
uh and going with conduction dominant.

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,840
You're sacrificing the potential of

53
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,519
taking uh the groundwater directly and

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,480
using that heat exchange uh and the heat

55
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,239
capacity it's offering to the system uh

56
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,120
to reduce the amount of drilling that

57
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,879
you have to do.

58
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,800
But we can also consider geothermal

59
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,879
networks as being multi-source and

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,879
multi-sync, right? So we don't just have

61
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,200
to do drilling. We don't have to meet

62
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:08,400
our entire load with the drilling. And

63
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,640
the the buildings around us have their

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,560
own histories. So we have some uh relic

65
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,120
structures that are are designed around

66
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,319
our steam systems, right? and to

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,280
retrofit those uh for example Empire

68
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,680
State Building quite a task right you

69
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,840
can imagine that that thing was built

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,799
around a steam system and you don't want

71
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,360
to just gut the iconic structure itself

72
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,640
so over time we're going to have to

73
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,000
think about expanding on the peripheries

74
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,680
of our existing central systems so

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,920
you're going to encounter uh various uh

76
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,239
requirements on building entering water

77
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,799
temperatures that are going to kind of

78
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,040
dictate how you have to put this system

79
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,760
together. The temperature regimes are

80
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,159
going to vary.

81
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,159
So, you're going to encounter perhaps

82
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,680
combined heat and power systems when

83
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,920
you're looking at building stock

84
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,040
decarbonization.

85
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,159
And uh this goes into something that is

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,280
already a district energy unit. It's

87
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:19,040
it's considered very high efficiency,

88
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:22,000
but you're also um exposing the owners

89
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,199
to a variable fuel cost. So, in this

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,600
case, I've got biomass systems shown. Uh

91
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,560
but you can also have you can also have

92
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,360
everything from coal to natural gas for

93
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,520
these combined heat and power systems.

94
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,759
And you can think about expanding with

95
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,680
geothermal energy networks at the

96
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,160
periphery where these district energy

97
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,880
systems exist.

98
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,240
And so going into the sources and syncs

99
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,320
that exist across our geographic area

100
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,440
that we can leverage to decrease that

101
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,600
capital cost at the beginning of your

102
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,720
your project consideration and your

103
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,840
feasibility studies. Uh one of the

104
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,120
majors uh that's that's taking its place

105
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,919
in geothermal and hybrid systems is

106
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,160
wastewater energy transfer.

107
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,800
Uh there's a few different manufacturers

108
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,720
out there. You can either do interceptor

109
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,199
connects which is those u fluid conduits

110
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,639
that are exiting each structure or

111
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,280
running down uh your your neighborhood

112
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,280
uh in a in a main collector. Or you can

113
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,360
do an effluent heat recovery. So in

114
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,199
effluent heat recovery, you have to go

115
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,680
directly to the the sewage facility

116
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,280
itself to recover the heat that they

117
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,080
need to reject. So all of those affluent

118
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,840
facilities are now exposed to

119
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,880
regulations that say they can't

120
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,880
discharge to surface water as they have

121
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,759
uh without meeting a a minimum or rather

122
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,080
a maximum temperature differential over

123
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,880
the year. So we're seeing time and time

124
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,960
again they have megawws like hundreds of

125
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,960
megawatts of thermal just from single

126
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,639
sewage facilities that they need to

127
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,160
discharge

128
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,240
uh and they don't have a place to go

129
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,400
with it. So imagine the possibility of

130
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,400
reducing your capital costs on drilling

131
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,960
and making these geothermal energy

132
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,199
networks more viable.

133
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,680
You can hybridize it directly with the

134
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,560
surface water that you want to um

135
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,639
perhaps harvest heat from or reject heat

136
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,360
to. But again, if you're going to reject

137
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,759
heat to that surface water system, you

138
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,160
have to operate within these future

139
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,919
confines of the projected regulations

140
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,960
that say you have a maximum temperature

141
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,840
differential. It's actually quite simple

142
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,080
uh for new construction

143
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,319
uh to meet that minimum of standard

144
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,120
because you can imagine that we built a

145
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,680
city on top of the earth. We're actually

146
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,440
influencing the ground temperatures more

147
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,960
than anything and so our our influence

148
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,880
on surface water nearby surface water uh

149
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,280
resources is quite high already. So you

150
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,759
have to just prove or disprove that your

151
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,319
system discharge is operating within

152
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,960
those environmental regulations. And if

153
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,680
you reduce the operating temperatures by

154
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,880
implementing geothermal energy networks

155
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,560
for your HVAC systems, it becomes much

156
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,039
easier to meet that norm.

157
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,360
and geothermal energy networks. If we

158
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,520
get into a lower temperature regime like

159
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,280
Connor had mentioned, somewhere between

160
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,000
40 and 90 degrees of operating

161
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,280
uh across a season between your highs

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,280
and lows, you can also introduce load

163
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,440
sharing. So as that heat pump is

164
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,639
rejecting to a hydronic network then

165
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,840
another u building along the the route

166
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,199
may be extracting heat from that network

167
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:57,680
and that in fact does reduce primary

168
00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:00,000
energy consumption across our cities.

169
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,759
So that's a a resource that you can tap

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,240
into uh to decrease again capital costs

171
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:11,199
but also mitigate your emissions from

172
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:14,879
the system even in scope 2.

173
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,360
And uh then we can consider all these

174
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,800
sources and syncs in aggregate. I'm not

175
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,520
sure if you saw this slide from

176
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,000
yesterday but very simply put we know

177
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,319
that we're electrifying building heating

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,199
and cooling already. It's just a matter

179
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,759
of doing it right responsibly or we're

180
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,640
doing it irresponsibly. And this is

181
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,959
based on a a you know system by system

182
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,120
basis. Connor mentioned that Seattle

183
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,919
might be a good place for some cold

184
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,959
climate air source heat pumps to operate

185
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,600
efficiently, but you also have district

186
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,160
energy operators that have to switch

187
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,640
over to electrification strategies of

188
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,959
their own. oftentimes you'll see them

189
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,440
putting in electric boilers with a

190
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,519
coefficient of performance of one or

191
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:04,000
less. Right? So that has impacts on our

192
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,880
uh electrical infrastructure. The grids

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,600
scale impacts are a consequence that we

194
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,440
all have to deal with. If we can

195
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,000
implement geothermal energy networks and

196
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,640
uh achieve more passive heating and

197
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,800
cooling opportunities, load sharing

198
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,959
across our cities, then our coefficient

199
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:28,959
of performance can increase from the co

200
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:33,200
cop of one for the electric boiler uh uh

201
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:36,240
up to about 6 to 14 for most systems

202
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,480
that have been measured so far. And of

203
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,240
course, passive cooling opportunities

204
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,360
exist where you have surface water

205
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,519
bodies because the uh the temperatures

206
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,920
that they require

207
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,680
uh are sufficient

208
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,800
uh to leverage the the the water source

209
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,080
itself. So you might think of between 42

210
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,480
degrees Fahrenheit and 50° Fahrenheit,

211
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,320
you can use the surface water directly

212
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,959
as a cooling source and your coefficient

213
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,600
of performance can then exceed 20

214
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,000
perhaps reaching as high as 60. So

215
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,440
that's energy in versus the thermal

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,680
energy that you get out.

217
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,720
And really quickly these are network

218
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,839
topologies that you have to consider.

219
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,320
uh ringed network is the ones that we've

220
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,880
been talking about more more commonly

221
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,279
for this workshop but there are other

222
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,560
variants that you see as you get to

223
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:37,440
larger and larger scale systems.

224
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:40,240
Uh meshed networks can be uh an an

225
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,680
evolution of that but they have more

226
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,440
hydraulic disadvantages in some cases.

227
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:50,320
You can have stagnant loops and radial

228
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,800
grid systems are the most commonly seen

229
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,800
in conventional district heating and

230
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,399
cooling.

231
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,600
So in this case, you can also have what

232
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,440
is an a near ambient distribution system

233
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,519
in a radial configuration with

234
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,480
distributed heat pumps, but you're going

235
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,839
to also have to have a central plant. So

236
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,360
you can either have distributed

237
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,560
equipment, you can have central

238
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,480
equipment or you can have a

239
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:20,800
hybridization of these.

240
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,839
And you can also in this example connect

241
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,399
uh existing high temperature district

242
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,720
heating and cooling systems with their

243
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:33,920
own near ambient energy exchange loop.

244
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,200
So there are ways to decarbonize and

245
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,880
leverage ground source systems without

246
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,600
always having to go to ambient

247
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,320
temperatures.

248
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,079
All right. And these are uh again the

249
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,640
many process uh heat recovery sources

250
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,680
that you can encounter such as data

251
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,560
centers, the wastewater energy transfer

252
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,040
uh and existing CHP systems that you

253
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,480
already have existing uh across the

254
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,160
cities.

255
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,279
So, uh, the the heat sources and sinks

256
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,000
themselves are numerous and these have,

257
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,760
uh, design consequences,

258
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,639
uh, that Brian is going to get into next

259
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,360
and describe with a case study and then

260
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,639
give you some decisionmaking points to

261
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,000
think about next.

262
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:29,200
Uh, final thought here, if we skimp on

263
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,079
design, we we sacrifice everything else.

264
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,839
are operating and and maintenance is

265
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,680
going to be abysmal and we're going to

266
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,760
be stuck with these systems for the next

267
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,399
50 years. So that's why having this

268
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,560
conversation now as we're transitioning

269
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,880
to electrification and building heating

270
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,040
and cooling is important. We're going to

271
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,880
live with this.

272
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:54,659
All right. Thank you.

273
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,659
[Applause]
