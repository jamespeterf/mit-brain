1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,040
you've seen that there's more technical

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,359
problems than a standard class and that

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,640
means you're in the right place if

4
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:23,560
you're here for a computational class

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,359
right um this is 21m 383 computational

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,560
music theory and Analysis or I can't

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,000
remember if I call it analysis and

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,240
Theory don't hold it against me um I'm

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,120
Michael Cuthbert I'm the professor of

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,360
the class I'm a professor of Music in

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,399
music and Theater Arts and um do some

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,960
work with computational analysis so what

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,760
I want to start with oh and just that's

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,559
who I am I'm going to get to know who

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,399
you guys are on Friday and next

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,879
Wednesday um it's very important to me I

17
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:56,960
want to really quickly be able to learn

18
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,359
Everybody by name but on the first class

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,719
I think you're all here to figure out if

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,439
this is the place you want to be before

21
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,920
we get to know everybody else so that's

22
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,000
why I'm not going to be going around and

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,560
asking everybody today but I'm going to

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,520
I really want to know that soon so the

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,960
big question for this class the whole

26
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,080
semester is going to be how do computers

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,799
hear

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,479
music what does that even mean um I'm

29
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,079
going to give you an answer if you care

30
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:29,960
about answers like this that you can uh

31
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,640
read absorb pack up and go home and uh

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,280
uh you no need for this class if this is

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,799
satisfactory computers hear music by

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,960
using a microphone connected to an

35
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,920
analog to digital converter connected to

36
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,560
a microprocessor where then specialized

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,240
codec I can never remember what that

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,600
really means um to quantize the sound

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,719
into a wave file or AAC or something

40
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,560
else file that we store on a magnetic or

41
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,079
solid state disc or we store on the

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,439
cloud and store on somebody else's

43
00:01:52,079 --> 00:02:01,479
magnetic solid state disc right um not a

44
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:04,479
very very useful um answer so what I

45
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:07,159
think we more want to know is the

46
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,239
computers are hearing music but are they

47
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,720
actually

48
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,879
listening and U these two terms hear

49
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,440
versus listen uh in different contexts

50
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,800
one of them has higher priority than the

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,400
other and implies a more deep um deep

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,000
understanding like um you know Mom or

53
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,920
Dad ever tell you I know you heard me

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,200
but did you listen to me right we have

55
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,959
that kind of distinction built in so we

56
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:40,480
want to know is um when computers hear

57
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:43,519
music what kinds of understanding might

58
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,519
they have might might um might be

59
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,280
encoded in that as if you feel

60
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,200
uncomfortable with the notion of

61
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,120
computers you know having their own

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,360
autonomy or something like that and

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,680
um the only reason I really care about

64
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,640
this question is that by understanding

65
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,360
how how a computer hears it might change

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,720
how we hear or it might open up new

67
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,120
pieces for us to listen to that we

68
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:14,120
didn't already know and most importantly

69
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,720
it might answer questions about what

70
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:20,159
it's like for us to be humans any

71
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,959
Androids here okay uh what it's like for

72
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:29,159
us to be humans who are listening to

73
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:31,599
music so here are any six big unknowns

74
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,680
for me that I want to know the answer to

75
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,480
I'll just say uh you turn in on Friday

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,959
the correct answer to any of these six

77
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,680
questions you get an A+ and you don't

78
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:45,840
have to take the class but I don't know

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:48,000
them so why do we listen to music I why

80
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,400
kind of you know we don't go around all

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,920
day you know I have my um different

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,959
scents that I smell all day or it's I we

83
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,000
don't you know there all kinds of things

84
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,040
that are enjoyable but that seem to be

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,640
different that we don't do all day long

86
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,920
nowadays um why do people choose what

87
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,959
musical styles they like how does your

88
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,159
musical tastes or our whole culture's

89
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,879
musical taste change over time and some

90
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,599
of us will be from different cultures

91
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,959
and have different musical tastes what's

92
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,320
the difference between a great piece of

93
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,600
music and a mediocre or a bad one or do

94
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:24,400
those terms even really exist um what

95
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,560
makes a piece of music beautiful or

96
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,720
ugly and let's not forget about the

97
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,600
physical why do I want to dance or move

98
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,280
move when I hear some music and other

99
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,960
ones I just want to sit and cry um so

100
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,479
these are the questions that if you

101
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,960
answer them I mean that would just be

102
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:45,000
astounding I think however that a one

103
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,400
semester twice a week um U you know

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,039
class we're not going to get the

105
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,039
defintive answer to them so I like to

106
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:54,160
break these questions into slightly

107
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,160
smaller unknowns that helped to answer

108
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,120
these questions and that we might be

109
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,840
able to start making progress

110
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,160
on um what particular musical

111
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,560
characteristics distinguish a folk song

112
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,600
from one part of the world from one in

113
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,479
another how does the look of a band its

114
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,080
costume age its racial composition

115
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:16,120
affect the makeup of the audience I mean

116
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,560
you you know I'm not about to be a heavy

117
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,560
metal star the way I'm currently dressed

118
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,680
right what what does that mean maybe

119
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,199
maybe I'm okay at the piano um I'm

120
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,520
actually better at metal than the Pian

121
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,360
you'll hear but that's okay I'm pretty

122
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,960
bad at at both um what sorts of cord

123
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,160
are used for relaxation for rest for

124
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,479
stop in music today and how is this

125
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,199
different in different centuries or

126
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,039
different parts of the world um and what

127
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,840
do the lyrics of top selling songs have

128
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,000
in common with those of worst selling

129
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,080
songs or don't have in common um and you

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,440
know the that's a question that um you

131
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,880
know I know that there are people at the

132
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,919
big record labels trying to answer that

133
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,680
um because there's money

134
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:00,720
involved what rhythms or instruments a

135
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,240
company texts about sadness or death

136
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,639
that appear less often in moments of

137
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,039
Happiness right that's kind of related

138
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:11,280
to the why does some music make me cry

139
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:13,440
so on so five good questions that might

140
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,240
help us answer a big

141
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,759
unknown what I'm going to do is I'm

142
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,599
going to leave three up and take two

143
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,840
off and say that these three questions

144
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:27,000
in particular musical characteristics

145
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,639
distinguishing X from y chords used at

146
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,599
certain points and change over time

147
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,919
rhythms about and connections to emotion

148
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:38,840
these all might be questions that having

149
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,560
a representation of a musical score

150
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,240
whether it's more modern with

151
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,520
handwritten ancient these are questions

152
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,680
that might help

153
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,360
answer so let's just kind of recap what

154
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,960
are some of the things the computer's

155
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,000
good at with

156
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,000
music I mean kind of old slides you'll

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,759
see it's pretty out but that we you know

158
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,840
we make a lot of music with computer we

159
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,840
mix it we um you know we we sort of uh

160
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,680
do re-editing with

161
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,759
it computers are absolutely changed how

162
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,360
we distribute music how we get it how we

163
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,639
access it um and then very cool you know

164
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,000
apps and algorithms developed at places

165
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:25,720
like this can tell you know what kind of

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,919
what song particularly is some drunken

167
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:32,240
jerk singing in a bar

168
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:36,400
that's me um

169
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:39,440
but but until about the last decade and

170
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,120
a half uh little had changed since the

171
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,520
70s and 80s in how computers could be

172
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,560
used to analyze scores um and so things

173
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,120
are changing now but let me say you know

174
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,159
where things were um what what people

175
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,479
already had for let's say text that's

176
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:58,560
that's different from

177
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:00,520
music so if you load a text you know

178
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,680
we're all Compu Geeks at least to a

179
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,639
little bit is I consider that as a term

180
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,639
of endearment for myself but hope that's

181
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,759
okay we're all computer people and um

182
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:12,360
you know so we can look at a a I can use

183
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,240
the term string right we can look at a

184
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,879
string of text like this and you can ask

185
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,360
various um algorithms already exist in

186
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,120
any programming language to be able to

187
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,039
identify the spaces right split or

188
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,159
what's a foreign diacritic cast it to

189
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,479
aski and see what crash is um what's

190
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:30,120
punctuation and then if you have uh you

191
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,000
know some kind of font rendering you'll

192
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,039
know what's going below the line and so

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,080
on what's a capital letter all these

194
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:40,320
things and this level of lowl

195
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,800
information about text really helped to

196
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,000
build the next level of information

197
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,959
about text sentence diagramming

198
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,040
understanding from letters to a sentence

199
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:54,560
level understanding and this kind of

200
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,920
builtup knowledge has helped to make to

201
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,519
the next level which we might be arguing

202
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,959
today about whether or not there there

203
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:08,040
is an actual meaning involved I'm hungry

204
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:11,560
I'm spam um so can we build these

205
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:15,680
Technologies for musical scores

206
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:20,839
maybe maybe but not yet today so this is

207
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,560
a class that I hope people five six 7 10

208
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,640
years from now hopefully less hopefully

209
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:30,600
not 30 50 um that what you do in this

210
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,760
class will help get to that level of of

211
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,560
understanding um I think put it

212
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,800
somewhere um this is a unique really

213
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,680
unique class um I think that there's

214
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,600
about three other classes that are

215
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,320
something like computational music

216
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,640
theory uh offered in the world today the

217
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,600
other ones are all doctoral seminars or

218
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,800
graduate

219
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,920
seminars this is a class that because of

220
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,959
mit's unique ability to merge the Arts

221
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,640
and programming a deep knowledge of

222
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,920
music and and a great culture of

223
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,560
collaboration in um in solving problems

224
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,200
we can do this at the undergraduate

225
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,240
level and if you're a graduate student

226
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,360
we can do even more uh with yall on that

227
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,600
so what are some of the Technologies we

228
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,800
need to build um well here's some simple

229
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,040
things that a computer has to know to do

230
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,560
anything with scores start off with

231
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,120
DFG what's the next

232
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,720
note

233
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,600
a not H right not even the Germans who

234
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,200
have H would would go on from that so

235
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,279
you need to know about these cyclic

236
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,560
little things um take a look at this

237
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,560
next

238
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:43,600
slide yeah okay we got some squirmers in

239
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:46,399
the room right right that 3 four this

240
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,200
does not compute um so we need to have

241
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,639
an idea of meter and things and then

242
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,200
from there building up you know which of

243
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:57,639
these two scores is more consonant and

244
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,639
which is more dissonant

245
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:08,120
so we need a concept of consonants

246
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,079
dissonance and how to bring this with

247
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,480
score so we're going to need to step

248
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,959
back from some of even the middle siize

249
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,399
questions and go to even smaller things

250
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:23,000
so for instance let's say this is the um

251
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:26,040
chovsky uh 1812 Overture and let's see

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,079
if um we wanted to understand how the

253
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,079
key relations work how we move from one

254
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:32,680
uh key to another and how this builds up

255
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,399
the form and the tension and the power

256
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,880
of the piece well in order to do this we

257
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,680
need to know where all the key changes

258
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,720
are right so we have to be able to cut

259
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,399
the score into smaller pieces and

260
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,720
identify that now how might you identify

261
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,680
a key change well you might say Well it

262
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,600
starts off with a Cadence in one key and

263
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,040
then it ends in a Cadence in another key

264
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,959
oh so now we need to be able to identify

265
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,000
cadences so we need something that can

266
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,200
do that well well this chord moves and

267
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,200
you know five moves to one so that's a

268
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,600
particular type of cadence

269
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,600
that term when I say five moves to one

270
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,200
are people hearing Roman numerals in

271
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,399
your head and visualizing it uh these

272
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,320
are the levels of musical knowledge that

273
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,160
we're going to be using a lot here and

274
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,000
so in order to figure out if a chord is

275
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,320
a five chord or one chord or what's in

276
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,160
the chord at all if it's major or minor

277
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,000
we need a representation of chords and

278
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,800
notes and pitches so some of what we're

279
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,720
going to be doing at the beginning of

280
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,680
the class is recreating some of these

281
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,040
tools and then we'll see what other

282
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:35,639
people have done and go further from

283
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,279
that so the notion that um that we don't

284
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:40,079
have all these things is kind of

285
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,920
surprising because there's a lot of

286
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,360
money a lot of work that's been out

287
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,320
there taking some sort of representation

288
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,959
musical score whether notation or midi

289
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,800
or something like that some sort of a

290
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,880
score and playing it really nicely on

291
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,440
speakers and things like that gr all

292
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,519
those things or um if you've used not

293
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,800
flight finale sellus Doro something that

294
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,320
flat IO you know that we can take a

295
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,440
representation of notes and turn them

296
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,880
into some sort of musical score so I

297
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,320
think of that as kind of output uh it's

298
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,160
like a printer and then um a lot of uh

299
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,279
work especially in research Labs on

300
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,920
taking sound in and converting it into

301
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:22,279
that kind of digital representation

302
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,760
that's useful for search things but once

303
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,800
you have a digital representation of a

304
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,399
score already in your computer what do

305
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,920
you do with it how do you analyze it how

306
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,560
do you work with it and there's been a

307
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,040
lot less research on this so it's like

308
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,320
we've been spending all our time

309
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,880
building printers and I don't know how

310
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,480
do we get things in Scanners and much

311
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,160
much less time building our actual CPUs

312
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,839
nobody has a CPU that looks like that

313
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:49,480
anymore time to update your slides Prof

314
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,759
um okay so one of the things that um

315
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,639
we're going to be using a lot in this

316
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:57,040
class is the toolkit that I and many

317
00:13:53,639 --> 00:14:02,160
other people at MIT have used um to do

318
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:04,600
these kind of manipulations and um it's

319
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,399
think it's correct to say it's the most

320
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:11,160
used toolkit in the world for working

321
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:14,759
with musical scores uh it's python free

322
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,839
and open source and um sometime over the

323
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,199
next couple days you're going to be

324
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,120
installing it um with Pip

325
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:25,040
stall so music 21 really works from the

326
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,560
notion that um first we're going to

327
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,279
encode a lot of groundup Concepts about

328
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,720
music so that um when you have a chord

329
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,680
is that going yep we'll just generate a

330
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,440
chord obviously not obviously otherwise

331
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,199
you need this class but you're going to

332
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,959
have a representation of how to

333
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:45,560
represent pitches middle C E G and then

334
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:47,560
all the different things once you have

335
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,959
that chord that you might be able to do

336
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,120
you might get its lyrics I don't know

337
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:56,120
it's going by really fast um get its

338
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:59,360
volume is it is it a diminished Triad so

339
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,680
you can do that and hopefully any good

340
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,000
computer program seeing ceg for is

341
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:09,279
diminish Triad will return no no false

342
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,199
anything like that zero right yep

343
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,040
good um so in the amount of time it

344
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,880
takes to write computer program that can

345
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,720
tell whether ceg is a diminished Triad

346
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,839
uh you all can hear it instantly right

347
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,959
so why have a computer do things and

348
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,120
it's really so that we can listen to

349
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,319
music faster than we can ever listen

350
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,639
with our ears so this this is a

351
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:35,560
particular example of code in music 21

352
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,680
similar code in other toolkits that will

353
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:42,800
take uh Corral by Johan Sebastian Bach

354
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:45,440
um his 11th canata 6th movement encoded

355
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,839
as a file called music XML store it as a

356
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,279
variable get the Alto part out of it

357
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,079
store it as alto get measures 13 to 20

358
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,600
as excerpt do a particular analysis

359
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,040
where we're going to put all these stars

360
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,600
on according to how um how strongly

361
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,800
accented something might be metrically

362
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,959
and show

363
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,880
it and really any music analyst in the

364
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:10,839
amount of time I took to do this could

365
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,040
have done it herself or himself or

366
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:17,480
theirselves but what's the great three

367
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,240
letter is it preposition preposition

368
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,079
that makes computers really

369
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:28,120
powerful begins with

370
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:31,240
f oh four four yeah so we just put a for

371
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,480
Loop in and suddenly we're looking at

372
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,880
every Corral that Bach wrote getting its

373
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,279
alart measure 13 to 20 doing the same

374
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,399
thing and of course why just do that

375
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,279
little excerpt why just do the Alto part

376
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,600
let's grab every Corral four Loops

377
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:47,839
within four Loops don't over optimize

378
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,319
first figure out if you can do this um

379
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,560
in the time it takes you to get a cup of

380
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:56,399
coffee right um yeah uh we'll come back

381
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,880
to that theme in the class A lot um in

382
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,560
your computer science intro classes you

383
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,600
you're going to early on be thinking a

384
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:07,720
lot about is this O big O of n s is this

385
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,199
n cubed is this n log n all these terms

386
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,919
we're going to talk about that from time

387
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,280
to time here but for the first part

388
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:18,520
we're going to build tools that work in

389
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,240
an acceptable to us amount of time

390
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,480
you're going to hear me use this term a

391
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,039
lot when we have a really big research

392
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,440
question about oh I don't know um 15th

393
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:33,000
century musical styles and we'll say

394
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,360
people have waited 500 years for this

395
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,039
answer 10 minutes isn't so bad right um

396
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,679
and then then later you know you can you

397
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,840
can go back and make it a three minute

398
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,760
problem something like

399
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,320
that some of the questions we might ask

400
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,720
that come up um that these kinds of

401
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,960
toolkits are built to solve are higher

402
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,840
notes

403
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,600
louder we many of us perceive them as

404
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,120
louder are they given louder Dynamics so

405
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:02,799
we can plot um pitch everyone know

406
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,240
octave numbers middle C C4 is the

407
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,080
standard American representation today

408
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,159
and the cello doesn't really go up that

409
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,520
high I don't know is sportando really

410
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,960
somewhere between Forte who knows these

411
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,840
are kind of slightly arbitrary but

412
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,120
doesn't look like it to me um now this

413
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,000
is one little graph probably want to do

414
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,440
this on a couple thousand pieces run

415
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,960
some regression lines all the things we

416
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,039
can do but we can start answering those

417
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,960
questions how does Robert Schuman use

418
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:36,200
notes differently from Fredick

419
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:39,360
chopan and I plotted this in plotting

420
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,000
the pitch usage of Schuman I can see how

421
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,360
beautiful it's a really nice bell curve

422
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,480
really great uh chopan on the other hand

423
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,640
looks I don't know kind of like one of

424
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,080
these cities with no planning laws like

425
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,200
here's I say ABI dbby with a gigantic

426
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:59,039
skyscraper when chopan likes a gsh it's

427
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:02,880
not just any GP it's this gsh is just

428
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,200
going to keep playing it forever so so

429
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,200
these are some of the ways you can do

430
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,880
this uh any Robert schiman experts out

431
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,559
there no some some hands almost went up

432
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,120
some people like Robert Shuman garbage

433
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,960
in garbage

434
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,159
out this particular piece by shiman is a

435
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,799
string

436
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:22,440
quartet this piece by shopan is a piano

437
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,120
when you have a string quartet of course

438
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,600
you're going to have more instruments

439
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,280
with notes in the

440
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,679
middle so I did this once I thought I

441
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,679
had compared Apples to Apples and I

442
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,880
realized I compared apples to oranges so

443
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,480
we're going to think a lot about user

444
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,000
error also in how we make

445
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,080
things

446
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,960
um visualization of music is a big part

447
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,240
of what we're doing these kinds of

448
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,919
visualized graphs can make understanding

449
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:53,159
a piece very easy uh you can also use 3D

450
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:54,760
graphs which don't make it easy at all

451
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,840
to understand anything but they look

452
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,360
really cool if you need like donors and

453
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,760
funding and stuff so so always make them

454
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,360
when you when you need that but

455
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,960
otherwise I can't really read

456
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,080
that we could combine different fields

457
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,760
so for instance geographic information

458
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,919
and plotting with musical

459
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,080
characteristics so this is one of my fun

460
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,640
things I found um comparing the

461
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,360
distribution of large intervals these

462
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,760
are intervals close to what would be

463
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,400
Western 7ths but obviously they're not

464
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,640
exactly that because different cultures

465
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,120
use different intervals but looking at

466
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:35,440
the folk songs differing and you can see

467
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,640
a large difference um as we move

468
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,760
northward and a little bit as you move

469
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,919
Inland in China in the increase of large

470
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:45,280
intervals that are not octaves in folk

471
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:48,200
songs and um we'll look at certain point

472
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,559
over the semester at a very cool um

473
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,919
paper that kind of shows how a

474
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:56,440
particular mountain range divides folk

475
00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:00,240
songs that are very different um on

476
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,240
either side of that range

477
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,760
if you're looking for particular

478
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,679
fingerprints that might tell you who a

479
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,279
composer was maybe there's these small

480
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:15,520
moments you might find there's one

481
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:19,240
moment in this um piece from around

482
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,559
1500 that is feels like it might be in a

483
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,480
modern composition where you just smash

484
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:28,799
your hand down on a piano was very hard

485
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:32,720
to see here but with a computer what can

486
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:35,400
do is we can take all of the notes and

487
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,799
put them into singular chords here

488
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,640
reduce them all so that they're in

489
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,640
closed position everyone remember that

490
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,720
from music theory class as close

491
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,360
together as you can make it annotate the

492
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:51,320
intervals and suddenly this one little

493
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,200
moment jumps out as very strange then

494
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,159
you can go back and figure out how did

495
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,159
the music create

496
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:02,320
this over the course of the semester we

497
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,320
looking at um changes in music over time

498
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,799
so this is um and we're also going to be

499
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,679
looking at various things that were done

500
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,840
by people either in this class or who

501
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,600
had worked in um the lab that um helps

502
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,640
create music 21 um so Beth Hadley was a

503
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,440
gra somebody who graduated from this

504
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,760
program who did this analysis and

505
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,880
looking at a lot of rock um popular

506
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:27,159
music songs the 1950s and 60s see the

507
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,480
base moves quite often by five semit

508
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:32,240
Tunes up or down which corresponds to

509
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,200
sort of a movement of 1 to four or 5 to

510
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,440
one things like that um and then

511
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,760
occasionally up by two semmit tones

512
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,240
what's that in the 1451

513
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:46,679
progression four going to five to one

514
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:50,880
and so you can see how this really

515
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:53,080
dominates at that go yeah at the time

516
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,559
most data set it says post 1980 it

517
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,000
should say 1980 to 2000 data set and you

518
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:02,400
can kind of see if we go back and forth

519
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,200
how it's still these fives and twos that

520
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,320
the main thing but

521
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,919
um these other

522
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,760
intervals are continuing to move up and

523
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,440
becoming more and more important love to

524
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:19,480
see an analysis we now have another full

525
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,960
20 years 22 and a quarter years by the

526
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,000
time the semester is done um worth of

527
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,760
music after 2000 to see if this trend

528
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,760
continues or stopped

529
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,679
uh anybody youall have taken either some

530
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,600
sort of a theory class so at some point

531
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,760
who has written a parallel fifth in this

532
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,200
class accidentally yes okay wow some

533
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,320
people have never written a parallel

534
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,039
fifth that's amazing or you you always

535
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,679
did it on purpose just to annoy your

536
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:49,320
teacher right so we can find next time

537
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,360
you you've given that you can generate

538
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,360
your own list of every single time that

539
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,799
Yan Sebastian Bach wrote a parallel

540
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,080
fifth or an octave so that you can give

541
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,880
it to your teacher and say yeah that was

542
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,320
a parallel fifth but it's exactly like

543
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,200
what Bach

544
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,840
wrote once you've written a program that

545
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,880
does a particular type of analysis on a

546
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,760
particular Corpus of Music a collection

547
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,039
of Music an analysis it's easy to swap

548
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,799
one or the other so that once you have

549
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,279
something that finds all parallel fifths

550
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:23,320
in Johan Sebastian Bach then we can put

551
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:25,159
it into cladium monity and find the same

552
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,520
analysis and do different things so each

553
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:30,559
of our tools can work on what what is it

554
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,120
if most of our tools I'll say not all of

555
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,360
them most of our tools can work on any

556
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,880
Corpus and any Corpus can apply to

557
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:40,440
multiple tools so this is a place where

558
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,600
you get sort of a squared um increase in

559
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:46,200
power by using the computer over if you

560
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,200
wanted to do this U by

561
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,919
hand I'm trained primarily as a

562
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,960
musicologist that is a a music historian

563
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,080
somebody first trained to do things um

564
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,200
by hand and look at history and look at

565
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,840
context and come to conclusion

566
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,960
I did a lot of computer things and um

567
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,360
for a little while I kind of these were

568
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,000
slightly separate worlds I'm trying to

569
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,039
move them more and more together so that

570
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,840
when we answer a particular question we

571
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:16,159
think about which of those big questions

572
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:19,000
what bigger answer might we have come to

573
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:22,919
so this was a particular demonstration

574
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,760
program I wrote early in um early in my

575
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,760
development that I was like oh cool I

576
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,200
have um you're going to see well we'll

577
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,039
talk about why JS spx's coming up a lot

578
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,399
um but I have all these pieces by Bach

579
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:36,919
let's go through and I know that Bach

580
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:39,159
when he um when he writes a piece that's

581
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:39,159
in

582
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,159
minor how's it going to end generally

583
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,080
anybody

584
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:54,200
know in the c major

585
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:57,120
chord yeah this kind of I call it picity

586
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,760
third so usually when he's in minor he

587
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,640
ends in major I TR to find every

588
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,760
exception to that in his uh Coral

589
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:09,320
composition great um

590
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,640
so pretty easy find all these places and

591
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,120
then I was pretty happy that I found

592
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,240
that there's exactly uh eight of them

593
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,799
and I thought that was that was kind of

594
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,640
neat until one day I was a little bit

595
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,799
bored and I started looking at what

596
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,520
these pieces were what pieces went with

597
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:29,880
these weird numbers and I looked at the

598
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:31,760
first one um piece 20 48 in box catalog

599
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,919
and I saw oh that one's wrong the

600
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,159
computer didn't get it I didn't expand

601
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:40,240
all the repeats so the final bar in the

602
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:43,799
piece then said Doo wait which way's

603
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,840
right for you yeah Dapo Aline so go back

604
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:48,039
there and the actual end was in the

605
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,559
middle and that one was in major so

606
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,919
followed that then I looked at these

607
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,559
other pieces I saw there something some

608
00:26:52,919 --> 00:27:00,240
people call orphan Corrals there're ones

609
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:01,840
that um jsbx son CPE box said Dad wrote

610
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,080
and published them but we have no other

611
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,880
evidence that Dad wrote them and the

612
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,000
only time this ever happens is in those

613
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:12,320
collections so some people have been

614
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,559
arguing maybe these pieces aren't really

615
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,080
by Bach or they've been edited heavily

616
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:20,360
this seems to give us some of the

617
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,919
evidence that that might be true so

618
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,399
always remember that the computer is not

619
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,399
substituting for analysis it's a tool to

620
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:32,000
make the kind of analytical questions

621
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:36,279
you might already have more

622
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,679
efficient that's why yep that's what you

623
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,960
know the first couple of things that

624
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:43,640
we're going to be looking at in this

625
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:46,559
class are how we represent music what

626
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:49,200
kinds of scores are happening and so on

627
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,799
um and we'll get into why you might do

628
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,760
one representation or another um one of

629
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:56,000
the first things we'll look at is music

630
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,760
as a series of boxes of Russian nesting

631
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,679
dolls whatever you want to call it box

632
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,200
within a box within a box so we have a

633
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,799
score inside that box we have some parts

634
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,640
inside those boxes we might have

635
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,200
measures um we might have voices two

636
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,960
different independent voices within a

637
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,440
measure something like that so we'll

638
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,159
call those kind of part-based containers

639
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,200
we going even put the score into a

640
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:20,880
bigger box with like the Opus all the

641
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,519
works by in a

642
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:27,360
collection and then our second box we

643
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:30,480
might have um is everything that happens

644
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,279
at a certain point in in time so

645
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,080
everything that happens here everything

646
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:38,159
that happens here here and we'll be

647
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,000
looking at and trying to identify when

648
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,120
one representation might be better and

649
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,360
when another representation might be

650
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:48,600
better and how you might use write tools

651
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,600
to move from one representation to

652
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,120
another from a box based to a moment

653
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,760
based you'll see we sometimes call this

654
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:00,039
slamy spacing like you just chop the

655
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,039
thing like a like a slamy

656
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,519
a really important moment and this is I

657
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:10,559
alluded to with the the bo there is to

658
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:14,000
try to make sure that the conclusions

659
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,600
that we're making apply to more music

660
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,120
that's out there and that's only

661
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,760
possible if we have a lot of music and

662
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,320
that music is representative of people

663
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,600
who create

664
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,799
music here's some of my favorite

665
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,600
composers out there uh we have lud Von

666
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:32,360
bet

667
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,760
we have uh Joseph Buon chalier s George

668
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,919
Kate soer friend of this music

669
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:41,159
department uh Amy Beach fogner Rickard

670
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:43,480
Vagner jsbach uh Scott Joplin Queen Lily

671
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:44,760
ulani I spent part of my year in Hawai

672
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,840
very important

673
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:51,600
composer um Yamada Kos uh Wolf Gang

674
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,080
Mozart we got Dolly Parton and the

675
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,440
Beatles so these are people that I would

676
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:01,440
really love to do my work on so I go and

677
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,039
I start doing the work and of course um

678
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,360
I don't want to encode all of this music

679
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:09,559
in so I go with what other people have

680
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:12,679
encoded and that lets me work on this

681
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:14,799
subset of Music very representative

682
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:16,399
subset of of the people who were up

683
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,720
there

684
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:22,120
before no not at all we have Boven Bach

685
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,799
Vagner

686
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:30,440
Mozart um all great composers long dead

687
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,360
white males of copyright and then still

688
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,760
in copyright of white meil group The

689
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,840
Beatles that somehow there's just always

690
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:41,240
Beatles everywhere um you can almost

691
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:43,200
always get that so this was a state of

692
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,360
Music we something it's called Corpus

693
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,039
research work on large collections of

694
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,760
scores a corpus body a large body or

695
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:52,360
Repertory of scores um when I started

696
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,360
going into

697
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:59,880
this thankfully the situation is getting

698
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:01,880
a little little better we now have the

699
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,120
complete piano Rags of Scott Joplin who

700
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,200
wrote the Entertainer Maple Leaf Rag if

701
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,120
you don't think you know his name play

702
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,440
some we'll play some of his music and be

703
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,960
oh yeah I know that music so very

704
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,639
important composer we're starting to get

705
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,639
in and individuals and groups are

706
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:20,559
starting to create collections like um

707
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:24,000
this collection of a couple hundred

708
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:27,639
scores by women and non-white

709
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,440
composers I hope that this class at some

710
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:34,760
point we will all contribute on to

711
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,279
improving uh the situation uh just a bit

712
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:40,720
and try to make it so

713
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:43,279
eventually what is represented is our in

714
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,840
our representations looks like the world

715
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,840
we want to be

716
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:53,919
in so um we're going you have in front

717
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:55,519
of you somewhere uh a syllabus so I'll U

718
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,120
so grab grab the syllabus we're not

719
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,480
going to go through it line by line and

720
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,360
line in fact I haven't even given you

721
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,720
yet um the longer one that's going to

722
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,360
tell you day by day what we're going to

723
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,159
do cuz part of that depended on how many

724
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,279
of y'all showed up today and it's a good

725
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,600
good crowd uh everybody comfortable um a

726
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:15,840
little bit little bit not over there but

727
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:20,159
um but we'll we'll somehow make this

728
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,120
make this happen Okay um you'll be happy

729
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,360
that this class um there's nothing to

730
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,440
buy that you unless you don't happen to

731
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,519
have some of these things earlier we'll

732
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:32,120
use as a textbook the music 20 the sort

733
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,519
of standard textbook the music 21 users

734
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,399
guide um probably get to maybe chapter

735
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:41,080
25 I always say 1 to 30 but we might not

736
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,600
get there um and we can't go too much

737
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,399
past 30 because it just kind of trails

738
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,279
off it's still being written uh you can

739
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,639
always write some more of it if you want

740
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:53,039
as part of a project

741
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:55,760
um you're required for me to support you

742
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,799
for me to be a help to have a Windows or

743
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,679
Mac OS laptop we're going to install um

744
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,799
the latest version of Music 21 which is

745
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:06,360
I believe

746
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:09,080
8.1 um the hope the plan the bags under

747
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,440
my eyes right now was to get Version 9

748
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,159
released before today uh it's not out it

749
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,960
has some of the U near features that

750
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,799
we'll be using uh we'll get um I'll

751
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,039
probably get that out within a week or

752
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,440
two now you all are my focus um and then

753
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:27,240
we'll put that on so at some point we'll

754
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:31,080
I'll upgrade to that um music 21 version

755
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:35,279
8 runs on python 3.8 Version 9 runs on

756
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:37,519
310 so uh install of python 310 you'll

757
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,919
be very happy with that or

758
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,360
311 probably want to get some staff

759
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,440
paper and a pencil because at various

760
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,559
points um unless if you're using a

761
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,720
tablet you're probably fine but um it's

762
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:50,080
concise hard if you're taking notes on

763
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,279
laptop and we'll some point be using

764
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,120
that staff a lot there's four

765
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:55,399
recommended books I love them but

766
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,200
they're all ebooks but you might

767
00:33:55,399 --> 00:34:00,200
consider buying them um Le Le the first

768
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,440
two were pretty cheap and things but we

769
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:06,039
don't really need to talk about that

770
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:10,760
more okayy we're we're making great um

771
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:13,200
time the typical week we're going to on

772
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,760
Wednesday um introduce a particularly

773
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,440
new topic this is just sort of middle of

774
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,399
the semester right and then you're going

775
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,119
to get some readings to do for IT some

776
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,280
of them will probably be for by Friday

777
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:25,399
we'll try to make Wednesday to Friday I

778
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,200
mean kind of a a time more for reading

779
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:31,399
and reflection and things on Friday so

780
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,159
maybe the topic is oh I let me not be

781
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:36,159
hypothetical what is topic three it's

782
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:38,079
written here somewhere uh okay

783
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,480
containers we just talked about this how

784
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,639
to represent as containers what are the

785
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,760
various ways working through that so

786
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,919
we'll just sort of introduce like we did

787
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,240
now a new topic and think about it a bit

788
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:52,720
on Friday we'll get to some of the

789
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,839
nitty-gritty difficult things um

790
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,119
discussion of why this representation

791
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:59,320
work why this doesn't why you might make

792
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,839
this choice and we'll do some inclass

793
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,040
work on that and then usually on Fridays

794
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:07,119
you'll get a problem set so you'll get

795
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:10,440
that on work on it but over the weekend

796
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:13,240
um you'll also be getting um a little

797
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:15,560
bit of asynchronous content so what

798
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,920
happened was um nobody really cares

799
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,880
about the history of your class but I'm

800
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,400
going to tell it anyway um we started

801
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,000
this class it was an hour and a half

802
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,040
twice a week and then Co hit and

803
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,680
suddenly a lot of things went online and

804
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,240
I did a lot of video Rec recording um

805
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,040
partially because my wife and I were

806
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,480
teaching at the exact same time in a one

807
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,200
bedroom house that had no um you know no

808
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,640
way for us to to teach so we did some

809
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,560
asynchronous things and a lot of the

810
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,000
asynchronous content I'm so glad you

811
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,000
will never have to see again it was so

812
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,599
you you all W live through that right

813
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,359
but some of it was actually better than

814
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:52,319
in class because

815
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:54,720
sometimes every once in a while there's

816
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,240
something that I can teach you a

817
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,839
particular technique and then if it was

818
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,079
in class I'd say great so now you know

819
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,640
how to do that and let's go on and

820
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:02,560
here's another technique and let's go on

821
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,599
and you haven't had any chance to

822
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,280
practice any of them so there's some

823
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:08,720
things that are useful about the Susi

824
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,680
street style of here's a particular

825
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,520
thing that takes me about five minutes

826
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,520
to present and then you work on it for

827
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,079
10 minutes then here's another 5 minutes

828
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,920
to work on a 10 before you know it

829
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,400
you've had one hour of lecture and

830
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,599
you've had about three hours of a

831
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,640
problem set you've done problem by

832
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,319
problem so those ones are still there

833
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,440
there's about uh seven of times during

834
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:31,119
the semester and and um I just guarantee

835
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,960
I wouldn't be doing that if I didn't

836
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,960
think that that was a better way to do

837
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,640
things so you'll do some of that work

838
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,800
there on Wednesday and this will be um

839
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,720
at least four or five hours before class

840
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,240
so I can do a quick spot check that's a

841
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,560
great part about doing um things all

842
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:52,800
online turn in the problem

843
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:54,440
set and then we'll um unlock the tools

844
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,200
what does that mean means if you're

845
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,160
working on something let's say we're

846
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,400
doing something with chords

847
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,440
I'm going to ask you to to figure out

848
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,319
certain of the algorithms for how to

849
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,800
solve some difficult problems with

850
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:08,359
chords and some of most of the things

851
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,119
that you're going to be doing somebody

852
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:12,280
in the world has solved I hope that's

853
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:13,760
not too disappointing most of what we do

854
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,480
in most of our classes instructural

855
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,920
engineering saying somebody has solved

856
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,400
it we're learning to do it

857
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,160
ourselves so at that point we're going

858
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,200
to show you some of the tools that are

859
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,040
already out there to do this and they

860
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,839
will become unlocked to you that is to

861
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:31,079
say you can keep doing using using the

862
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:34,119
tools that you built or you can use um

863
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:36,440
the standardized chord manipulation

864
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,839
tools and then we'll introduce the next

865
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,240
topic and keep going over here it does

866
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,680
mean that you're sometimes going to have

867
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,880
two topics going simultaneously and I

868
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,079
hope that's not too weird I'm going to

869
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,079
try to make that as

870
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:04,480
ready to go when when it all

871
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,520
loads go to runtime run

872
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,520
all and then stop that will probably

873
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:13,200
take like two to three minutes okay so

874
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,160
we'll go on from that and I'll just talk

875
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,480
a little bit about final projects while

876
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,160
that's going which way are we there we

877
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,160
are okay

878
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,079
great so what we're going to do at the

879
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,079
end of the semester is have final

880
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:26,640
projects we're a little bit big class

881
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,280
I'm probably going to let anybody who

882
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,000
wants to have a group of three um do

883
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,040
that because of the number of people

884
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,200
here but generally two works really

885
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,680
really well um solo groups are really

886
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,640
hard and I found that groups bigger than

887
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,359
three have almost always um had some

888
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,839
problems so we're going to do a final

889
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,960
project we and I used to say any Topic

890
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:51,520
in computational music U or music theory

891
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,040
and Analysis or composition types things

892
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,200
as long as it involves representations

893
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,240
of scores of the computer I now have one

894
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:02,040
exception I've um a lot of a AI deep

895
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:06,119
learning for composition projects have

896
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:08,520
tended not to do as well as the students

897
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:10,880
who ran them were doing in the class so

898
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,839
I'm going to not allow that for this

899
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,520
semester um to try to figure out um how

900
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:18,599
we can do that a little bit better so

901
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,520
that's just to um just me learning from

902
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,040
experience you're going to spend some

903
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,640
time researching um a topic that you

904
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,240
work on programming the tools needed to

905
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,599
do it reading about what what mistakes

906
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,000
you might have done and just think about

907
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,760
it then what I want from you is you're

908
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,280
then you're going to be making a video

909
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,720
about your project five minutes um I

910
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,880
know I'm a hard Professor I could have

911
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,480
made it 10 minutes and it would have

912
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,480
been a lot easier but five minutes you

913
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,119
have to you know kind of be on toes so

914
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,000
what I want a couple days before that is

915
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,400
just a draft of your script it can I

916
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,480
don't care how messy it is I just want

917
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,040
to see that um that I'm not going to get

918
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,319
a frantic phone call at 11:30 p.m. that

919
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,560
none of our software works or something

920
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:04,440
like that and then um you record and

921
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:06,119
edit a 5 minute video so let's get back

922
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,920
to that live

923
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:12,079
code and somewhere on here this one

924
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:17,160
we're all up

925
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:21,920
and where do I have it I have mine here

926
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,920
let me make this bigger in three

927
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:30,520
ways every anybody not get a note here

928
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,960
and maybe this one sometimes doesn't

929
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:36,640
work for a lot of people so don't worry

930
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,280
if that doesn't work for you but um give

931
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:44,440
me a thumbs up we got it okay cool so

932
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:48,040
let's let's start with um me finding my

933
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,560
script great so let's do um some of the

934
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,119
things we can

935
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,160
do if you don't care about polluting

936
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:57,319
your code base sorry I got to move this

937
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,160
a little bit um go ahead and import um

938
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:01,760
from music 21 import Star it should

939
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,200
already be in there you'll know this who

940
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,160
has anybody not used a Jupiter notebook

941
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,920
or anything like that please give who

942
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,200
has used one give me okay so don't need

943
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,640
to do too much but we can yeah we'll

944
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,640
enter in a new code thing move it down

945
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,359
so go ahead enter a new code Brank and

946
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,400
let's just make sure that if I type

947
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:23,119
chord and hit shift enter something like

948
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:28,160
that comes

949
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:30,480
out cool okay great so let's grab um

950
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,240
there's a particular piece by Bach that

951
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,280
we'll use quite often in this class I'm

952
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,839
going to use it less often this year

953
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,520
because we have more Alternatives now to

954
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:41,000
this and we don't want to perpetuate the

955
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,119
B is everything stereotype but this one

956
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,440
we'll use a lot so we'll assign to the

957
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:51,560
variable bo something from the music 21

958
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:54,839
Corpus calling the method parse on it

959
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:57,920
and we can just type

960
00:41:54,839 --> 00:42:00,440
bwv 66.6

961
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,720
um I am not uh devil worshipper or

962
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:06,440
something 666 happens to be the shortest

963
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:11,400
Corral that b ever wrote so it's a nice

964
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:14,599
one for us to work with here and shift

965
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,760
enter and that should load um if you

966
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:18,200
ever if something doesn't work um this

967
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,920
is the time to cheat and look off your

968
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,880
neighbor and see see if maybe you

969
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,960
mistype something or or tap them on

970
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:27,359
we're all in class we're all here always

971
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,319
just to help each other right we we feel

972
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,240
that you're going to do that people

973
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:35,160
around you good okay so let's show it

974
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:37,400
the first time you run show it's always

975
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,040
a lot slower than every other time

976
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,640
hopefully it won't take too long you

977
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,000
should get a score up there

978
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,200
somewhere good uh right now you're only

979
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,480
going to get the first page of the score

980
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,520
um though this that's why I use this one

981
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,760
because it's only one page long uh soon

982
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:59,440
you'll get the whole score okay um so

983
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:03,880
let's go ahead and let's get that Alto

984
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:06,359
part so we'll say Alto equals Bach Parts

985
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:10,640
is a way of getting something out

986
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:10,640
Alto and then Alto

987
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,880
doow I see something

988
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:25,880
looks like this Alto part's always a

989
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,880
little

990
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:37,599
something like that on your page good um

991
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,119
you can also get a part by um doing it

992
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,800
numerically

993
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,720
so anybody know in a course what are the

994
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:48,800
four parts highest to lowest soprano

995
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:50,800
soprano Alto ten come on participation

996
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,960
grade let's already get our things

997
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,800
soprano Alto tenor base great so if we

998
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:02,200
can do it by numeric order we want to

999
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:05,920
get the alto that's what number part two

1000
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:08,000
two one yes zero index python so one of

1001
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,480
the things you'll get and so that should

1002
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,559
be the same Part Parts one good good

1003
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,680
guesses good wrong guesses I love I love

1004
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:16,559
great wrong guess is better than great

1005
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,559
uh than even uh getting it right on the

1006
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,800
first time one of the things you'll find

1007
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,160
is if something is in computer speak we

1008
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,319
leave it alone so uh we don't tend to

1009
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:28,359
number the parts in the orchestra hey

1010
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:30,119
instrument 17 do this no so when we do

1011
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:33,559
that we leave it in computer speak and

1012
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:37,800
make it um make it sort of uh you know

1013
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:39,640
zero index when we leave things that um

1014
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,440
that musicians might know however we

1015
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:46,720
tend to use the um the the musicians uh

1016
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,720
things so let's get the soprano part

1017
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:54,680
part zero here

1018
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:58,640
and let's get measures 4 through six so

1019
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:01,680
do measures 4 comma 6 do show and in

1020
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,319
Python that should get you the fifth

1021
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,200
measure through the SE through the sixth

1022
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,040
measure because of the way zero indexed

1023
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,839
however measure numbers measure numbers

1024
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,680
something that human musicians talk

1025
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,040
about yeah yeah you've you've heard of

1026
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,079
that great we'll save time Always by

1027
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,599
just being being Fearless at shouting

1028
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:22,280
out when I ask a rhetorical question

1029
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:24,520
like measureing numbers we know

1030
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,160
musicians yeah good good that that to

1031
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,000
save time in the class um so yeah since

1032
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,000
musicians know what measure four is

1033
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,280
we'll use measure four that way so

1034
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,319
that's measure four through six um great

1035
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,800
so let's start manipulating the score

1036
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:42,960
let's say that

1037
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:45,359
the 5 ah thank you that is measure that

1038
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,920
is whatever a musician thinks measure 4

1039
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:51,359
is so in this particular piece let's go

1040
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:53,480
up to the beginning of the piece

1041
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:56,680
um

1042
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:58,319
yeah what measure is this that the mouse

1043
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,000
is on

1044
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:02,800
zero yeah pickup is what a musician

1045
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,160
would say we got to give it a number so

1046
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,000
what number do we like here zero so

1047
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,960
there can be a measure zero if there's a

1048
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,920
pickup but measure one will always be

1049
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,480
whatever humans uh musicians think

1050
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,280
measure one should should be so let's we

1051
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,960
can play um some other things let's

1052
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,960
let's just play around with the score a

1053
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,359
little bit we'll take the soprano get

1054
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,720
measure five you'll also see some of our

1055
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:28,839
display things don't know how to display

1056
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,599
the the right number um if you're on

1057
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:36,440
mcore 4 it now displays the actual

1058
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:38,200
correct number um but let's get um let's

1059
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,319
make so this measures four through five

1060
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,720
let's make the

1061
00:46:39,319 --> 00:46:44,359
formada red so what number if I'm

1062
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,119
getting notes I'm going to get it index

1063
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:48,200
by number so we're going to get measure

1064
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:49,640
five and get a particular number on that

1065
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,400
what what what note number is the

1066
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,400
formada shout it

1067
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:58,960
out two in this case musicians don't

1068
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:00,520
tend to talk about I guess we do say the

1069
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,000
second note yeah yeah that's really

1070
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:06,000
confusing so in this case uh basically

1071
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,960
when we're using the bracket square

1072
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,280
bracket notation I'll make this a little

1073
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,760
bit bigger does that help a bit yeah um

1074
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:16,680
we'll think of it computer so we'll say

1075
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:19,359
um C I should I should call it C Shar

1076
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,000
equals but then you just get what

1077
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,400
comments for the rest of the line so

1078
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,920
we'll just call it C even though it's a

1079
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,839
c c

1080
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:31,240
style I think I can just check nope that

1081
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:36,200
doesn't give me autocomplete equs

1082
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:36,200
red and soprano

1083
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,480
show we got the soprano I'll scroll back

1084
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,800
up again so you can

1085
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,359
see we already got the soprano we take a

1086
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,359
particular note the third note indexed

1087
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:58,160
by two from measure five which is

1088
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:00,480
actually five and and assign it

1089
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,839
here probably we could have made

1090
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,920
different decisions on how we number

1091
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:06,400
things right um if for version two but

1092
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,880
whatever and then we'll set the style of

1093
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,440
that notes color to red and then show

1094
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,880
the entire soprano line and we get

1095
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,800
something over

1096
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,160
here I'm half color blind is there

1097
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,040
actually a red note up there okay good

1098
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,319
good good where is it it's over here

1099
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:25,680
we'll emphasize that for the camera um

1100
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:29,720
sh a laser on it becomes more red um

1101
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,480
okay now um yeah that's kind of fun play

1102
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,920
around things

1103
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,599
um something we might actually want to

1104
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,079
do let's take the whole piece we called

1105
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,599
it B

1106
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:43,680
right zero index yeah Bo a score object

1107
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:43,680
let's analyze its

1108
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,960
key analyze is a method so we call it

1109
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:54,240
like this parentheses parth score key if

1110
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:57,240
you so let me say if you're following

1111
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,280
along at 80% but you just would I would

1112
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:01,440
go a little little bit slower and then

1113
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,839
you'd be able to have it it's going to

1114
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,760
be fine because U most of the time we're

1115
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,400
going to go slower than this this is

1116
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,000
just the sort of the fun beginning of

1117
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:13,319
the semester uh if you've never seen a

1118
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,319
parenthesis or a square parentheses uh

1119
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:17,839
this might be a class to take next year

1120
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:20,839
or next semester uh after doing a little

1121
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,119
bit more programming um and that's

1122
00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:24,559
probably more for the camera people

1123
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:26,760
watching at home let's make sure that we

1124
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,119
um that we just need a little bit

1125
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:33,960
programming before we're going to go

1126
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:36,599
forward okay so the piece as a whole F

1127
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,839
minor what do we do now I've tried to

1128
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,240
emphasize it early on but we're going to

1129
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:44,160
make this a habit in the class we always

1130
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,079
check our BS meter right says the piece

1131
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,960
is in F

1132
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:51,319
minor is that at all plausible looking

1133
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,960
at this piece uh let's just look at the

1134
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:58,079
base it's easier it looks like an a I

1135
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:59,880
mean it's three Sharps Maybe

1136
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,480
maybe the

1137
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,079
end

1138
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:07,280
f a Shar oh looks like it ends at F

1139
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:09,319
major but then maybe the rest of the

1140
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,680
piece is in minor and then this is just

1141
00:50:09,319 --> 00:50:14,440
the bo ending thing so it to me it

1142
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:16,000
passes the smell test it might be other

1143
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,359
things but one of the other things we

1144
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,680
can do is let's analyze measures oops we

1145
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:25,559
get Buck dot

1146
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:28,000
measures zero I haven't uh spoken out

1147
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:29,480
loud while I type for a while 0a 2 so

1148
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,720
we'll just get the pickup and the first

1149
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:34,040
two measures and we'll analyze the key

1150
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,040
of this

1151
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:41,119
opening ah a major that that feels more

1152
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:43,720
right for the opening so we know that

1153
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,280
the piece as a whole isn't F minor or at

1154
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,240
least the computer thinks so if the

1155
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,960
computer got it right and it opens an a

1156
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:54,480
major a logical thing that we might play

1157
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:56,440
with next is where does it change can we

1158
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,720
do that can we analyze where key changes

1159
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:00,720
are we're not going to do that well um

1160
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,760
let's let's get some easy thing so we

1161
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,079
said that not notes I use to get a

1162
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:09,240
particular note so let's see how

1163
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:11,119
many notes there are in this piece Len

1164
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:14,480
um any other language would be length

1165
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:16,079
but you know Len f. notes and how many

1166
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:20,119
notes take a

1167
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,920
prediction oh zero there are no notes in

1168
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:25,040
this piece it is the we started with

1169
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:28,680
cage 433 and we end with Bach 433 now

1170
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:31,000
why are there no notes it's because B is

1171
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,599
a score this is all about the

1172
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,599
representation we're currently in box

1173
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,440
within box within box there are no notes

1174
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,000
in the score there are notes within

1175
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,559
Parts no there are no notes within the

1176
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,839
parts parts have measures there are

1177
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:45,480
notes in measures so what we'll need to

1178
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:50,960
do is we'll

1179
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:53,400
say take the Bo and let's run recurse go

1180
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,839
into every box like like a child at

1181
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:59,559
Christmas open every single box and find

1182
00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:02,599
every single note in

1183
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:05,160
there so we'll say we can take a score

1184
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:09,960
we can say open up every box and to

1185
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:13,079
every box get me the notes and 165 let

1186
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:17,720
pass the smell test let's scroll up

1187
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:20,960
don't ask anybody ever to count this but

1188
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:24,200
that look like about 165 notes to you

1189
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,720
yeah just order of magnitude if it said

1190
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,079
1 million notes would something be wrong

1191
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,960
if it said zero notes you knew it was

1192
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:30,480
something wrong so we'll always try to

1193
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,400
do these kind of smell tests before we

1194
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,960
go on and the last thing I'm going to do

1195
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,640
because I'm looking at the time and and

1196
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,440
I I have only one good habit as a

1197
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,119
professor I really am allergic to

1198
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:47,000
keeping you over so we're not going to

1199
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:50,000
do this but we'll do just for fun bu.

1200
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
cify

1201
00:52:54,319 --> 00:53:00,880
doow now we've switched the entire thing

1202
00:52:57,559 --> 00:53:03,400
into salami slice

1203
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,680
mode so these are some of the things

1204
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,839
we're going to be

1205
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,720
doing hopefully that was good professor

1206
00:53:06,839 --> 00:53:11,440
mode now here's really evil Professor

1207
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:14,920
mode you're going to forget every tool

1208
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,799
that you've just been given analyze key

1209
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:19,040
is not available to you I I'll call it

1210
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:22,559
locking it it's locked in this little

1211
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:25,559
cabinet here when you write your own

1212
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,880
pretty decent key analysis algorithm you

1213
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:30,520
can unlock this one yours might be

1214
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,559
better um I might ask for a license to

1215
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,000
hey can we use that one there this is a

1216
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,240
pretty decent one but you might write a

1217
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,119
better one when you write your own

1218
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:42,559
certification algorithm then cify will

1219
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:45,200
be opened for you um we'll give you some

1220
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,440
tools uh extracting things particular

1221
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,200
measures um that was a lot of work but

1222
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,799
that kind of sounds boring boring in

1223
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:54,400
terms of our intellectual development

1224
00:53:51,799 --> 00:53:58,160
but coming up with the tools to be able

1225
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:01,319
to cify a score um um we'll see how many

1226
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:04,119
difficult things that come from that um

1227
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:06,400
and not the time's about up so we'll

1228
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:08,440
talk about that in other classes as I

1229
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,359
said on Friday I want to get to know you

1230
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:13,319
guys I want you guys to be able to talk

1231
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:15,760
more but I wanted today just to blab

1232
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:17,760
about what we might do in this semester

1233
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,400
and I'm happy to have you here the

1234
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,640
numbers look great uh you all come back

1235
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,880
Friday you all make sure that you're

1236
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:27,280
registered and I'm glad to have everyone

1237
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:27,280
in this class
