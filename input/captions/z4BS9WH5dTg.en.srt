staer concern about climate change has

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,720
focused significant attention on the

00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,760
building sector in particular on the

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,279
extraction and processing of

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,399
responsible for as much as 15% of global

carbon dioxide emissions in contrast

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,399
wood provides a natural form of carbon

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,440
sequestration so there's a move to use

17
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,160
timber instead indeed some countries are

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,399
calling for public buildings to be made

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,680
at least partly from Timber and large

an opportunity for further

or ground up to make garden mulch which

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,280
will decompose within a few years both

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,360
structures research group have been

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,360
developing a strategy for upcycling

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,000
those waste materials by using them in

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,680
construction not as cladding or finishes

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,439
aimed at improving appearance but as

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,240
structural components the greatest value

46
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,360
you can give to a material is to give it

47
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,640
a loadbearing role in a structure she

48
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,880
says but when Builders use virgin

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,680
materials those structural components

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,799
are the most emissions intensive parts

51
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,280
of buildings due to their large volume

52
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,399
of high strength materials using

53
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,039
upcycled materials in place of those

54
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,280
High car systems is therefore especially

55
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:08,160
impactful in reducing emissions mu and

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,879
her team focus on tree forks that is

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,640
spots where the trunk or branch of a

58
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:15,319
tree divides in two forming a y-shaped

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,480
piece in architectural drawings there

60
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,120
are many similar y-shaped nodes where

61
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,360
Straight elements come together in such

62
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,200
cases those units must be strong enough

63
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,560
to support critical loads tree forks are

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,440
naturally engineered structural

65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,360
connections that work as Canal levers

66
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,200
and trees which mean means that they

67
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,720
have the potential to transfer Force

68
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,400
very efficiently thanks to their

69
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,120
internal fiber structure says Mueller if

70
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,120
you take a tree fork and slice it down

71
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,040
the middle you see an unbelievable

72
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,879
network of fibers that are intertwining

73
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,120
to create these often three-dimensional

74
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,920
load transfer points in a tree we're

75
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,879
starting to do the same thing using 3D

76
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,040
printing but we're nowhere near what

77
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,440
nature does in terms of complex fiber

78
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,800
orientation and

79
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,000
geometry she and her team have developed

80
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,159
a five-step design to fabrication

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,159
workflow that combines natural

82
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,400
structures such as tree forks with the

83
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,799
digital and computational tools now used

84
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,440
in architectural design while there's

85
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:10,280
long been a craft movement to use

86
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,920
natural wooden railings and decorative

87
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,360
features the use of computational tools

88
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,480
makes it possible to use wood in

89
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,480
structural roles without excessive

90
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,599
cutting which is costly and may

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,760
compromise the natural geometry and

92
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:24,799
internal grain structure of the wood

93
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,920
given the wide use of digital tools by

94
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,720
today's Architects Mueller believes that

95
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,000
her approach is at least potentially

96
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,840
scalable and potentially achievable

97
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,840
within our industrialized materials

98
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,760
processing systems in addition by

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,080
combining tree forks with digital design

100
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,040
tools the novel approach can also

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,720
support the trend among Architects to

102
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,319
explore new forms many iconic buildings

103
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,519
built in the past two decades have

104
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,799
unexpected shapes says Mueller tree

105
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,360
branches have a very specific geometry

106
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,480
that sometimes lends itself to an

107
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,200
irregular or non-standard architectural

108
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,120
form driven not by some arbitrary

109
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,159
algorithm but by the material itself

110
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,079
Step Zero find a source set goals before

111
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,480
starting their design to fabrication

112
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,000
process the researchers needed to locate

113
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,920
a source of tree forks Mueller found

114
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,239
help in the urban forestry division of

115
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,040
the city of Somerville Massachusetts

116
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,519
which maintains a digital inventory of

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,880
more than 2,000 Street trees including

118
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,479
more than 20 species and records

119
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,720
information about the location

120
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,600
approximate trunk diameter and condition

121
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,720
of each tree with permission from the

122
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,199
forestry division the team was on hand

123
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,880
and in 2018 when a large group of trees

124
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,199
was cut down near the site of the new

125
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,360
Somerville High School among the heavy

126
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,759
equipment on site was a chipper poised

127
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,880
to turn all that waste wood into mulch

128
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,560
instead the workers obligingly put the

129
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,080
waste wood into the researcher's truck

130
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,560
to be brought to MIT in their project

131
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,680
the MIT team sought not only to upcycle

132
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,240
that waste material but also to use it

133
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,479
to create a structure that would be

134
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,600
valued by the public where I live the

135
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:59,320
city has had to take down a lot of trees

136
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,039
due to damage from an invasive species

137
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,840
of be Mueller explains people get really

138
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,080
upset understandably trees are important

139
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,520
part of the urban fabric providing shade

140
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,600
and Beauty she and her team hope to

141
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,680
reduce that animosity by reinstalling

142
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,680
the removed trees in the form of a new

143
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,880
functional structure that would recreate

144
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,600
the atmosphere and spatial experience

145
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,639
previously provided by the F trees with

146
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,319
their source and goals identified the

147
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,039
researchers were ready to demonstrate

148
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,120
the five steps in their designed to

149
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,280
fabrication workflow for making spatial

150
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,039
structures using an inventory of tree

151
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,560
forks step one create a digital material

152
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,720
Library the first task was to turn their

153
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,440
collection of tree forks into a digital

154
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,440
library they began by cutting off excess

155
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,520
material to produce isolated tree forks

156
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,680
they then created a 3D scan of each Fork

157
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,080
Mueller notes that as a result of recent

158
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,400
progress in photogrammetry measuring

159
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,080
objects using photographs and 3D

160
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,160
scanning they could create high

161
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,840
resolution digital representations of

162
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,280
the indiv idual tree forks with

163
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,160
relatively inexpensive equipment even

164
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,800
using apps that run on a typical

165
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,880
smartphone in the digital library each

166
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Fork is represented by a skeletonized

167
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,440
version showing three straight bars

168
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,639
coming together at a point the relative

169
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,479
geometry and orientation of the branches

170
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,919
are a particular interest because they

171
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,599
determine the internal fiber orientation

172
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:25,319
that gives the component its

173
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,880
strength step two find the best match

174
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,240
between the initial design and the

175
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,919
material Library like a tree a typical

176
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,639
architectural design is filled with

177
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,639
y-shaped nodes where three straight

178
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,199
elements meet up to support a critical

179
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,120
load the goal was therefore to match the

180
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,880
tree forks in the material library with

181
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,599
the nodes and a sample architectural

182
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,440
design first the researchers developed a

183
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:49,680
mismatch metric for quantifying how well

184
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,039
the geometries of a particular tree Fork

185
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,759
aligned with a given design node we're

186
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,680
trying to line up the straight elements

187
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,520
in the structure with where the branches

188
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,840
originally were in the tree explains

189
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,879
Mueller that gives us the optic

190
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,919
orientation for load transfer and

191
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,879
maximizes use of the inherent strength

192
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,919
of the wood fiber the poorer the

193
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:10,879
alignment the higher the mismatch metric

194
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:13,160
the goal was to get the best overall

195
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:16,000
distribution of all the tree forks among

196
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,879
the nodes in the Target design therefore

197
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,680
the researchers needed to try different

198
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,160
Fork to node distributions and for each

199
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,400
distribution add up the individual Fork

200
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,360
to node mismatch errors to generate an

201
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,080
overall or Global matching score the

202
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,800
distribution with the best best matching

203
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,759
score would produce the most

204
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,639
structurally efficient use of the total

205
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,599
treefork inventory since performing that

206
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,680
process manually would take far too long

207
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,919
to be practical they turn to the

208
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,520
Hungarian algorithm a technique

209
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,800
developed in 1955 for solving such

210
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,400
problems the Brilliance of the algorithm

211
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,879
is solving that mashing problem very

212
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,960
quickly Mueller says she notes that it's

213
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,960
a very general use algorithm it's used

214
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,639
for things like marriage matchmaking it

215
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,240
can be used anytime you have two

216
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,479
collections of things that you're trying

217
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,720
to find unique matches between so we

218
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,520
definitely didn't invent the algorithm

219
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,199
but we were the first to identify that

220
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,319
it could be used for this problem the

221
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,440
researchers performed repeated tests to

222
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,639
show possible distributions of the tree

223
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,319
forks in their inventory and found that

224
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,720
the matching score improved as the

225
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,479
number of forks available in the

226
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,479
material Library increased up to a point

227
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,680
in general the researchers concluded

228
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:29,759
that the mismatch score was lowest and

229
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,520
thus best when there were about three

230
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,279
times as many Forks in the material

231
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,360
Library as there were nodes in the

232
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,159
Target

233
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,440
design step three balance designer

234
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:42,039
intention with structural

235
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,880
performance the next step in the process

236
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,160
was to incorporate the intention or

237
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,680
preference of the designer to permit

238
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,040
that flexibility each design includes a

239
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,720
limited number of critical parameters

240
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,839
such as bar length and bending strain

241
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,880
using those parameters the designer can

242
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,240
manually change the overall shape or

243
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,519
geometry of the design or can use an

244
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,279
algorithm that automatically changes or

245
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,800
morphs the geometry and every time the

246
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,079
design geometry changes the Hungarian

247
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,720
algorithm recalculates the optimal Fork

248
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:15,079
to node matching because the Hungarian

249
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,200
algorithm is extremely fast all the

250
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:20,160
morphing and the design updating can be

251
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,480
really fluid notes Mueller in addition

252
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,640
any change to a new geometry is followed

253
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,240
by a structural analysis that checks The

254
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,600
deflections Strain energy and other

255
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,600
performance measures of the structure on

256
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,160
occasion the automatically generated

257
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,839
design that yields the best matching

258
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,440
score May deviate far from the

259
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,480
designer's initial intention in such

260
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,600
cases an alternative solution can be

261
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,120
found that satisfactorily balances the

262
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,160
design attention with a low matching

263
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,120
score step four automatically generate

264
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,600
the machine code for fast

265
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,959
cutting when the structural geometry and

266
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,720
distribution of tree forks have been

267
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,880
finalized it's time to think about

268
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,640
actually building the structure to

269
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,640
simplify assembly and maintenance the

270
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,760
researchers pair of the tree forks by

271
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,120
recutting their end faces to better

272
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,399
match adjoining straight Timbers and

273
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,360
cutting off any remaining bark to reduce

274
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:12,320
susceptibility to rot and fire to guide

275
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,240
that process they developed a custom

276
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,920
algorithm that automatically computes

277
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,040
the cuts needed to make a given tree

278
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,680
Fork fit into its assigned node and to

279
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,880
strip off the bark the goal is to remove

280
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,760
as little material as possible but also

281
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,880
to avoid a complex timeconsuming

282
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,880
Machining process if we make too few

283
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,000
Cuts we'll cut off too much the critical

284
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,880
structural material but we don't want to

285
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,560
make a million tiny Cuts because it will

286
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,160
take forever Mueller explains the team

287
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,680
uses facilities at the Autodesk Boston

288
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,160
Technology Center build space where the

289
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,920
robots are far larger than any in MIT

290
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,360
and the processing is all automated to

291
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,120
prepare each treefork they mounted on a

292
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,720
robotic arm that pushes the joint

293
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,720
through a traditional band saw in

294
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,320
different orientations Guided by

295
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,639
computer generated

296
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,079
instructions the robot also Mills all

297
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,680
the holes for the structural connections

298
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,200
that's helpful because it ensures that

299
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,399
everything is aligned the way you expect

300
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,240
it to be says

301
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,399
Mueller step five assemble the available

302
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,760
forks and linear elements to build the

303
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,279
structure the final step is to assemble

304
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,320
the structure the treefork based joints

305
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,000
are all irregular and combining them

306
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,279
with the pre-cut straight wooden

307
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,480
elements could be difficult however

308
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,160
they're all labeled all the information

309
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,720
for the geometry is embedded in the

310
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,560
joint so the assembly process is really

311
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,519
low teex says Mueller it's like a

312
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,079
child's toy set you just follow the

313
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,519
instructions on the joints to put all

314
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:39,560
the pieces together they installed their

315
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,720
final structure temporarily on the MIT

316
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,200
campus but Mueller notes that it was

317
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,839
only a portion of the structure they

318
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,760
plan to eventually build it had 12 nodes

319
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,680
that we designed and fabricated using

320
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,680
our process she says adding that the

321
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,160
team's work was a little interrupted by

322
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,399
the pandemic as activity on campus

323
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,880
presumes the researchers plan to finish

324
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,680
designing and building the complete

325
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,639
structure which will incl include about

326
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,440
40 nodes and will be installed as an

327
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,760
outdoor Pavilion on the site of the Fel

328
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,880
trees in Somerville in addition they

329
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,480
will continue their research plans

330
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,760
include working with larger material

331
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,399
libraries some with multibranch forks

332
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,320
and replacing their 3D scanning

333
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,000
technique with computerized tomography

334
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,800
scanning technologies that can

335
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,560
automatically generate a detailed

336
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,839
geometric representation of a tree Fork

337
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,600
including its precise fiber orientation

338
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,000
and density and in a parallel project

339
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,480
they've been exploring using their

340
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,480
process with other sources of materials

341
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,399
with one case study focusing on using

342
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,199
material from a demolished wood framed

343
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,399

346
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,839
provides new guidance for the

347
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,839
architectural design process with

348
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,720
digital tools it has become easy for

349
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,360
Architects to analyze the embodied

350
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,600
carbon or future energy use of a design

351
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,639
option now we have a new metric of

352
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,079
performance how well am I using

353
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,320
available resources she says with a

354
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,600
Hungarian algorithm we can compute that

355
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,839
metric basically in real time so we can

356
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,399
work rapidly and creatively with that as

357
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,760
