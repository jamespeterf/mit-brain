1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,480
and I'm very happy to kick it off with

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,359
what I think should be um a wonderful

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,320
panel I will turn it over to our

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,480
moderator Antonio Regalado from the MIT

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,360
technology review who covers the area of

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,359
biomedicine and he will introduce

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,800
today's panelists thank you Antonio

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,840
great uh thank you so much Rebecca I'm

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,560
glad to be here I do work at MIT

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,920
technology review some of you might be

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,000
surprised to know that this ecosystem is

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,080
big enough that it has its own

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,040
journalists um and not just me there's a

14
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,559
whole bunch of stat news Etc and so I

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,440
just want to relay an anecdote before I

16
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:37,680
introduce our wonderful panel is that uh

17
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,000
well actually bill here in the middle

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,680
asked me you know what kind of stuff do

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,520
you cover I said biotech uh um crisper

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,000
gene therapy that kind of thing um but I

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,760
realized you know what I really am an

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
ecosystem 30 years ago in 1995 I applied

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,399
for a job and I included a vend diagram

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,039
you know University industry capital I

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,160
actually put this in there as my huge

26
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,400
Insight when I was 25 I was like this

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,400
place is not just an idea it actually

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,280
exists and I'm going to go work there um

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,960
and so it's funny to think that my

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,200
career has uh actually started with such

31
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,600
a vend diagram our panelists are three

32
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,600
people who manage the inside of that

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,640
space right the

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,159
collaborations uh and the Strategic

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,960
Partnerships and they are from uh left

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:30,320
to right SEMA Basu uh head of strategic

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:35,640
Partnerships at Mass General Brigham uh

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,520
Bill kubasek who is a director of uh

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,320
strategic Partnerships at the broad

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,640
Institute uh right around the corner

41
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,600
here right down the street and Colin

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,560
staltz who is co-director of the Harvard

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,520
MIT Health Sciences program and MIT does

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,119
not have a medical school so you can bet

45
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,159
that he is also a professor in the eeks

46
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,000
Department electrical engineering and

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,280
computer science um so it's wonderful to

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,680
have you all here now even today as a

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,560
journalist when I write about the broad

50
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,200
Institute or someone who works at MGH it

51
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,959
can be hard even to write their titles

52
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,040
right they have so many titles and

53
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,239
affiliations um so we're going to be

54
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,080
able to sort some of that out learn a

55
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,920
little bit who's who about these

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,599
complicated and overlapping institution

57
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,840
so uh SEMA could you uh introduce your

58
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,879
institution and give us a picture of the

59
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,120
kind of things that you work on yes

60
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,239
happy to it's a pleasure to be here

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,280
thank you to you and backa for inviting

62
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:37,879
us um so my name is Sima Basu and like

63
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,800
he referred to I have two titles

64
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,760
strategic Innovation leader and head of

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,560
strategic Partnerships they actually

66
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,000
have some meaning in organization so

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,480
I'll take a step back and first tell you

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,280
for those who don't know what masteral

69
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,159
bream is and that will help so masteral

70
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,200
bream is an integrated academic Health

71
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,760
Care system and it has five Howard

72
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,159
Affiliated hospitals two general and

73
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,640
three specialty the two general aass

74
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:04,400
General and bream and Women's Hospital

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,720
and when I say we're an integrated

76
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,280
academic Medical Center that means we

77
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,959
have a fullart mission you know one is

78
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,799
uh Health Care delivery patient care and

79
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,720
related to it Community we care about

80
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,239
Equity equity and Health Care access and

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,720
then there is education because we're

82
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,200
affiliated with Harvard we have about

83
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,920
4,000 trainees that go through our

84
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,760
system on an annual basis whether

85
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,959
they're phds MDS MD phds and then we

86
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,519
have research and we call that pillar

87
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,640
not just research it's research and

88
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,439
Innovation because that is in our DNA to

89
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,680
not only just do research to build for

90
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,560
the future but also to innovate along

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,280
the way and so my title is strategic

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,920
Innovation leader because we're trying

93
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,959
to look internally always to see how

94
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,480
might we organize ourselves better right

95
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,000
for that mission and then head of

96
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,439
strategic Partnerships because I'm

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
trying to little part of my career I

98
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:05,280
spent at a Pharma company so I do have

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,319
you know the little bit of experience

100
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,239
having seen it from the other side and

101
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,879
I've been at Mass J Brigham 22 years now

102
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,880
almost so I can actually help bridge

103
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:18,919
some of those and know what how we can

104
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,520
structure for success with our industry

105
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:25,759
Partners as a win-win and so we have a

106
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,520
small Alliance team that is a Continuum

107
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,199
of trying to bring from what's

108
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,280
strategically important for us where do

109
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,440
we have a strengths how do we Bridge how

110
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,479
do we Bridge with our academic uh

111
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,759
partner uh research with industry

112
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,560
Partners in so many different ways

113
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,360
because as an academic institution we

114
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,280
have clinical insights based on which we

115
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,680
do research we do clinical trials

116
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,080
translational research but we in that

117
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,240
entire cycle need industry partners

118
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,680
because we're never going to make the

119
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,039
product the device the drug but if I

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,680
want to impact patient care I do need a

121
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:01,520
partner who can help us along the way

122
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,120
I'll stop there terrific uh Bill let's

123
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,320
hear from you I just want to uh it's

124
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,400
great to hear learn about the

125
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,440
institution you told me earlier that the

126
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,080
broad has does have a budget of $700

127
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,440
million a year 2,000 employees and later

128
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,720
on today I'm going to go check is is

129
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,199
that like the largest scientific

130
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,479
nonprofit in the world uh in this city

131
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,120
or or what we don't we don't know but

132
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm going to try and figure it out later

133
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:26,440
on so well let me know what you L learn

134
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,639
I will okay um yeah the broad Institute

135
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,440
is actually a lot larger than most

136
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,800
people think and actually is the broad

137
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,199
Institute of MIT and Harvard so it's

138
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,000
really a combination of MIT Harvard and

139
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,080
all of the surrounding hospitals right

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,560
and you know uh believe it or not we're

141
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,600
actually going to be celebrating we're

142
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,560
celebrating our 20th year uh at this

143
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,800
point so it's been around for for quite

144
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,199
a while and actually the precursor of it

145
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,919
was even started at the whitee head even

146
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,600
before that focusing on the on the

147
00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:00,520
genomics so you know the mission of the

148
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,479
bro is really to advance uh you know to

149
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,720
to get therapies to people to find

150
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,440
therapies to people and sort of the

151
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,520
Cornerstone of the broad and hence it's

152
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,919
uh sort of unique structure is all about

153
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,120
collaborations right the idea is is that

154
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:17,400
great science big advancements all come

155
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,759
through big collaborations big

156
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:24,360
collaborative efforts uh no barriers uh

157
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,080
things like that um and so for example

158
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,280
you know the building is designed to

159
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,440
Foster bumping into people right um even

160
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,120
that we don't have departments we don't

161
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,240
have a Department of Chemistry we don't

162
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,199
have a department of biochemistry and so

163
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,440
on and so forth um you know we have

164
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:43,400
programs we have a cancer program a

165
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,840
metab a metabolism program uh and

166
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,560
cardiovascular so we don't you know we

167
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,000
really try and pull down all sort of

168
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,360
these artificial barriers to Foster this

169
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,840
Innovation we you know we have big

170
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,440
collaborative consortiums with groups

171
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,919
all over the world um and also another

172
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,000
unique uh feature of the broad is is

173
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,639
that there are

174
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,440
2,000 uh full-time employees but there's

175
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,879
also about 4,000 members in the

176
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,120
community so we have different levels

177
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,960
many of them are at MGH for example or M

178
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,720
you know um in the surrounding hospitals

179
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,479
um we also have uh a lot of professional

180
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,919
scientists which adds a continuity

181
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,720
because we have a number of platforms

182
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:26,680
that really help enable advancing

183
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,599
discoveries uh identification of tarvi

184
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,280
development of Therapeutics you know we

185
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:33,160
have a metabol platform um we have a

186
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,599
proteomic platform we have the gene

187
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,599
pertubation platform we have the center

188
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,240
for development of Therapeutics which is

189
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,720
about 50 people that you know can

190
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,560
actually you know develop assays do drug

191
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,680
screening we have a number of compound

192
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,280
libraries do drug screening uh uh

193
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,479
chemical opt optimization and so we try

194
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,120
and you know pull all of this together

195
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,120
to really Advance um to advance

196
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,759
Therapeutics and then the sort of the

197
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,680
the critical thing here is this that we

198
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,879
have a number to do that we believe that

199
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,240
we have to partner with industry sort of

200
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:08,440
the vend diagram that you talked about

201
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,280
so we have collaborations with Deerfield

202
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,879
management which is uh a big investment

203
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,639
fir healthcare investment firm in New

204
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:20,560
York buyer Calico Labs Novo uh Novo no

205
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,720
disk Novo Foundation um and so we have a

206
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,280
number of different uh collaborations

207
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,000
where we work very closely and

208
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,440
collaboratively with them to advance

209
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,960
these things to get them closer to the

210
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,000
patients teric uh thank you Colin your

211
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:38,719
turn um tell us about the programs that

212
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,039
you run uh n MIT and what they're about

213
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,000
so I'm I'm I'm uh oh this is very loud

214
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,200
I'm I'm a boot on the ground and I think

215
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,040
while I can opine about the programs I

216
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,720
think there's another perspective here

217
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,120
that I think is um upo so I'm a

218
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,560
cardiologist at Mass General Hospital

219
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:00,200
and uh computer scientist in MIT and we

220
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,720
think very in a on a very granular level

221
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,839
about how we can take Technologies from

222
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,959
infancy to the patient and the steps

223
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,640
that are required therein and uh so some

224
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:12,160
of that involves fundamental science

225
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,480
that happens on MIT side some of that

226
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,360
involves clinical trials that happens on

227
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,320
the Mass General side and then lastly

228
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,000
bringing these things to fruition right

229
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,399
what what guides myself and the scholars

230
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,880
who I am privileged to Mentor is doing

231
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,880
things that will benefit patients at the

232
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,480
end of the day and how we can do that in

233
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,800
uh in an impactful Forum with with

234
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,079
respect to the uh HST program it is an

235
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,640
educational

236
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:40,440
program that combines uh both Harvard

237
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,720
and MIT we teach MD students and we

238
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,680
teach PhD students um who aspire to do

239
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,200
quantitative work at the intersection of

240
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,480
medicine and um Health Sciences our our

241
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,560
Scholars go on in a wide array of of

242
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,200
fields some of them in in the academy

243
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,079
many of them in Industry many of them in

244
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,000
startups so I can speak to either end of

245
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:02,360
that as you wish okay terrific I mean we

246
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
want to talk about Partnerships uh had a

247
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,440
partner with the ecosystem so I think uh

248
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,800
journalists like me were very example

249
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,360
driven so I'm definitely going to ask

250
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,720
for examples I think we just heard about

251
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,560
Deerfield that's an interesting one uh

252
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,000
there was a press release initially that

253
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,959
Deerfield um the initial value was $50

254
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,040
million it's been going on for a while I

255
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:21,120
understand that they get to uh pick and

256
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,160
choose different things that they work

257
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,839
on so what is actually how does that

258
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,839
collaboration work Bill what is the

259
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,360
outcome like what is the deliverable in

260
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,760
a sense uh of it right um well let me

261
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,279
just say on the outside each each

262
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,360
partner has a little bit different

263
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:39,720
objective of what they want out of these

264
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,240
collaborations of course they all want

265
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,560
to get to Therapeutics in the case of of

266
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,639
Deerfield I would say it's not so much

267
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,279
technology deriven it's more therapeutic

268
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,959
driven um is you know what what we're

269
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,320
looking for is they want to tap into

270
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,920
this great ecosystem uh that we have

271
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,120
that great expertise and work sort of

272
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,240
hand inand to you know take early stage

273
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,760
targets you know find you know validate

274
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,880
them develop all the tools and reagents

275
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,200
that you need to do drug Discovery as in

276
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,040
addition to further validation and then

277
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,120
the end goal is sort of to be able to

278
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,600
get them ready to go you know to be spun

279
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,760
into a company or to be licensed to

280
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,079
another company for the drug development

281
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,000
and you know if you think about if you

282
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,920
have a great thing in your lab and you

283
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,600
want to go to a VC they'll say oh you

284
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,600
know this is great but come back you

285
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,600
know you need more this sort of fills

286
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,800
that Gap it's already sort of a plug

287
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,040
andplay way to sort of fill that sort of

288
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,720
that bridge you know between the basic

289
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,360
you know Grant funded science and

290
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,000
getting it ready for a real drug

291
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,440
Discovery effort I would say uh Colin

292
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,120
let me just go to you and I get back to

293
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:53,000
you Sim to to Anchor this um at your at

294
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,959
MIT are you are you working in

295
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,040
Partnerships I mean you you're working

296
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,639
computer science AI but obviously all

297
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,040
this has to be deployed into medicine

298
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,000
which is kind of a different space so

299
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,079
what is what are what is the role of

300
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,360
Partnerships in your daily well I think

301
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,279
a seem as intimated these things don't

302
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,000
get to the people who really need them

303
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,680
without industrial support and buyin and

304
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,560
uh and collaboration and and there's a

305
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,279
long process and I think it's often

306
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:24,760
times not recognized the the

307
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:26,600
peculiarities with respect to

308
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,360
Technologies and Healthcare that have to

309
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,120
that have to be addressed to get it from

310
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,279
the conception of idea to the point at

311
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,079
which it gets deployed to um um a

312
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,480
patient and so we have had

313
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:38,120
collaborations we have an ongoing

314
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,440
collaboration for example with quantum

315
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,399
computers and that's something I can

316
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,680
talk about later on I think suppose that

317
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,720
that's that if there's interest in

318
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,079
developing technologies that help

319
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,600
patients with heart failure and it's an

320
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,120
interesting discussion about the idea

321
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,320
the fundamental research that happened

322
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,800
at MIT and then the clinical trials that

323
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,360
are ongoing at Mass General and then the

324
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,760
desire for Quant to roll out some of

325
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,680
this technology at least in in in Taiwan

326
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,199
what was imperative in that and is is

327
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,839
getting early buyin and early engagement

328
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:09,360
with potential industry partners and

329
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,160
that has worked that has worked uh and

330
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,600
that General approach how to do that is

331
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,360
something I don't know the answer to and

332
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,560
I think it's a caseby case sort of

333
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,920
discussion I'm sure somebody here

334
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,760
probably will tell will tell me the

335
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,320
answer get the solution I can take back

336
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,720
to the people who I collaborate with but

337
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,560
it's it's a longer discussion and I know

338
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,120
that SEMA is very very very very

339
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,160
familiar with terrific SEMA can you in

340
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,920
introduce us to one of the

341
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,199
collaborations that you manage and what

342
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,160
what what are

343
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:41,199
people what are the what are the

344
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,720
objectives of of the Barner okay so

345
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:45,720
maybe three-part one to Sure save you

346
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,600
time to look up if you maybe I should

347
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,560
have mentioned so we're the largest

348
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,120
employer in Commonwealth of

349
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,279
Massachusetts as Mass General Brigham

350
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,440
and out of that about I would say we

351
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:59,199
have over 7,000 clinicians and over 6

352
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,120
and a half thousand Howard appointed

353
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,959
research faculty right and that doesn't

354
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,000
even include faculty like him who are

355
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:11,399
actually MIT faculty that also have

356
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,759
appointments uh with us anyway so I just

357
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:17,199
wanted to say that with that U what Bill

358
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,880
said you know should resonate and all of

359
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,839
you should take away that each

360
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,600
partnership is a bit different you know

361
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,160
the biggest thing I tell our partners is

362
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,079
let's have a shared Vision that means

363
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,560
like what is it we're trying to achieve

364
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,600
what might be things it's a journey what

365
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,120
are you going to acheve achieve along

366
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,519
the way what's the long-term goal what

367
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,160
are short-term deliverables and each

368
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,800
we're very intentional because our needs

369
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,040
to partner with industry just like I

370
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,959
said in that cycle are in so many places

371
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,199
we're happy to find a partner that would

372
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,000
go the entire Continuum we're happy to

373
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,480
find partners that will just go one

374
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,120
segment with us right we're happy to

375
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,480
find Partners who work in three

376
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,000
indications with us we're happy to work

377
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,519
deep into one indication so we it is a

378
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,240
bit what each partner wants how are we

379
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:02,480
going to reach short so I really want to

380
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,199
leave everybody clearly with that

381
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,680
philosophy that we're very intentional

382
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:09,360
we're happy to take small sponsored

383
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,839
research programmatic approach but we do

384
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,600
encourage industry to think in terms of

385
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,480
themes and programs because it allows us

386
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,560
to be more meaningful and intentional in

387
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,759
how we bring our academic partners

388
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,160
because it's hard for them to do

389
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,920
something for three months four months

390
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,160
they really can't build on anything you

391
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,240
can't take people on and off NIH grants

392
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,680
you can't really h or somebody so the

393
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,759
more intentional you are in a little bit

394
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,639
longterm the better we can partner so

395
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,720
with that kind of contacts just to

396
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,560
Showcase we have many different

397
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,199
Partnerships my background because I

398
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,079
came from Pharma as and Therapeutics so

399
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:52,120
maybe I'll not talk about a lot of the

400
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:55,759
um um algorithm AI diagnostic but maybe

401
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,639
um of a and not even of the past ones

402
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,199
but ones we're actively working on right

403
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:02,120
now

404
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,880
which is uh we're a member of the lab

405
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,120
and square program that is uh between

406
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,920
academic institutions uh noo NIS and

407
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,639
evotech and the reason I bring that

408
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,880
because the topic here Rebecca really

409
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,160
wanted to say how does the whole

410
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,759
ecosystem work together and so for

411
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,360
example there you know it is in the area

412
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,079
of novo's Interest Novo is trying to

413
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,240
identify potential drug Discovery

414
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,639
projects but as you think in my job to

415
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,040
think with Nova what would make a

416
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,800
success successful program because at

417
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,199
the end I want the ecosystem to be

418
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,680
successful right for Massachusetts for

419
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:39,240
our investigators and for the patients

420
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:41,199
so in that we said we need maybe more

421
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,880
than one academic institution each

422
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:47,240
working to in their own capacity but for

423
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,600
the program that Noble wanted to build

424
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:54,839
and to Noble's credit they agreed to

425
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:57,279
have um Yale Harvard and uh MGH be the

426
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,560
initial party with whom they built what

427
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,399
would be the nuts and bolts of the

428
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,000
program how would we implemented what

429
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:07,280
would it cost what would be the uh legal

430
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,679
contract right and so and to be able to

431
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:14,280
bridge that Academia to um where would

432
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,679
be to bring resources one was funding

433
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,039
and the other was evot as a partner to

434
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,799
both Novo and US of course it adds

435
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,640
complexity when you have uh three

436
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:26,919
Partners but I just wanted to bring that

437
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,240
that you because resources are not

438
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:32,160
infinite for any industry how do you

439
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,919
operationalize it for Success right

440
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,919
there's a whole Mothership Nova nois

441
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,559
doing its thing but how does it create a

442
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,160
program that sits adjacent but can be

443
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,679
nimble can be fast can be tailored to

444
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,640
work with academics so that's one of the

445
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,720
ones I wanted to highlight it's only in

446
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,160
its first year so a long way to go

447
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,559
before we get to

448
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,840
outcomes um you know we're talking about

449
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,880
the ven diagram which I encountered 25

450
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,360
years ago so uh in a way it seems very

451
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,880
very static right uh the the the

452
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,799
institutions and the way they're

453
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,240
organized can seem static over the long

454
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,200
term but also things change like there's

455
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,080
uh boom and bust and and these sort of

456
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,760
cycles and especially since Co I wonder

457
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:19,480
if uh you can comment on whether what

458
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,480
industry wants is different um is it

459
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,799
constrained in different ways or is it

460
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,440
expanding into new areas like uh

461
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,880
thinking of them as your customer like

462
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,440
what what are how are their needs

463
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,159
changing what what kind of things are

464
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,440
you hearing maybe we'll just go straight

465
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:39,440
down the row here okay um so of course

466
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:42,480
um actually amazingly the immediate

467
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,840
pandemic years were not did not see as

468
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,720
much churn other than everybody adapting

469
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,240
amazingly well uh but it's been the post

470
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,760
this last year but it's a convergence of

471
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,360
a lot of macroeconomic uh things that a

472
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,559
lot of our larger partners because of

473
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,039
patent Cliff strategy changes R&D are

474
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:01,240
themselves going through a lot of

475
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,120
reorganization our industry Partners

476
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,360
it's harder they are a bit more

477
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,679
constrained and reorganizing so it's uh

478
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,559
we have to wait for them to come out of

479
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,360
that

480
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,520
strategy um to reorganize before we can

481
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,840
really be able to articulate there's

482
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,480
there's always been constraint on

483
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,880
resources but the constraints are

484
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,360
different to re understand what is going

485
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,520
to be different but there is definitely

486
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,520
some churn and I think it's driven by

487
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,679
the macroeconomics what is churn just

488
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,600
people

489
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,760
just changing what is early stage for

490
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,440
them which are the early stage programs

491
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,039
they want to get in and out of you're

492
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,520
hearing big headlines out of this in

493
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,400
this a lot of layoffs but I think it's

494
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,280
all driven by it's a cycle in when they

495
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,320
come out of it they will again be

496
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,240
focusing resources but at this point

497
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,799
sometimes it's hard to

498
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,320
Pivot

499
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,360
okay yeah I I would agree with SEMA I

500
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,880
mean we're experiencing similar things

501
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,280
all due to the same things I think

502
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,000
largely driven by the economics you know

503
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,640
there's been a contraction uh in biotech

504
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
funding and and so you know I you know

505
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,640
you see that partners are more hesitant

506
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,320
to pull the trigger on something they're

507
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,600
a little more risk adverse they know

508
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,880
they're going to have to fund this thing

509
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,360
deeper into the cycle you can't just get

510
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,640
a you know a lead and then license it

511
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,000
it's going to have to go deeper but I

512
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,240
agree that it's that it's a cycle and

513
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,159
and and things but it it is a little bit

514
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,360
tighter right now Colin you're closer

515
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:36,480
what is called AI which has to be in a

516
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,880
boom uh a boom Trend now it's going to

517
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,600
solve all the world's problems bring

518
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,159
world peace and uh so forth but but but

519
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,679
I think and we all can sit on the beach

520
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,120
while AI does of course where else would

521
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:52,760
we be um so I I I do think a common

522
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,679
theme that underlies this is you know so

523
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,919
uh Acom additions like to opine about

524
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,039
stuff but we don't always opine about

525
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,919
stuff that's important important and I

526
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:05,840
think the industry perspective is is is

527
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:08,200
unique in that they identify sweet spots

528
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,679
and special problems which necessarily

529
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,520
inquire new new new approaches and

530
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,600
finding these two individuals to come

531
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,120
together and communicate is challenging

532
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,240
and I have to say the MGB model at least

533
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,679
from the lowly boot on the ground like

534
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,039
myself is the NIH funding model right

535
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,760
and our lives are dictated by how and I

536
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:28,640
and that model is not necessarily

537
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,440
conducive for impact in the real world

538
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,919
mhm I think one of the things that that

539
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,559
Co that I took away from Co is that

540
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,159
people don't necessarily need to be in

541
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:41,000
the same room in at at at the you know

542
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,880
at the same time in order to have

543
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,440
impactful discussions moving forward and

544
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,600
and um I'm not quite sure if this is a

545
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,200
direct answer to the inquiry that was

546
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,840
that was that was made but I I think

547
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,760
something I do want to I do want to

548
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,600
stress is that mechanisms that allow

549
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:59,039
individuals with different expertise

550
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,480
somebody who has a a a um a method a

551
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,200
solution of thought and somebody who

552
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,320
knows how to do that and is willing to

553
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,360
support that together in an in in some

554
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,679
ecosystem whether they don't have to but

555
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,799
they're in different places or not I

556
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,360
think is essential to driving to driving

557
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:15,760
uh um a progress forward I hope that in

558
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,400
some way shape or form addresses a

559
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,279
sentiment you it does it does well

560
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,720
actually some of these people that

561
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,760
you're talking of might be in the

562
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,520
audience some of these potential

563
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,440
Partners so I would love to just throw

564
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,240
it open to see if we have questions for

565
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,720
our directors of strategic Partnerships

566
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,039
anybody anybody have a question that

567
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:35,400
they'd like to

568
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:37,600
ask any Brave questioners no okay um

569
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,559
maybe can oh if no question I was going

570
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,240
to say so while there is a constraint

571
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:45,640
you ask what am I seeing I'm also

572
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:50,880
seeing um for example some of our

573
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:53,200
partners um that do have um pipeline but

574
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,320
they do need to prioritize that pipeline

575
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,919
they need to be more resource efficient

576
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,279
for their clinical development because

577
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:03,279
it costs a lot should we're we are

578
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:05,960
seeing some newer interest around more I

579
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,520
would say early development just before

580
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,720
getting to clinical trial because a lot

581
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,360
of the Innovative newer pipelines like

582
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,840
cell therapy and all require a lot more

583
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,679
thinking on the what are the biomarkers

584
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,679
what might be the end points and so

585
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,840
we're seeing a little more uptick and

586
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,200
collaborations around that because as

587
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,039
Mass General Bram we do have a lot of

588
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,720
clinicians a lot of patient clinical

589
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:33,240
data longitudinal data she was like can

590
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,000
we actually work together to use that to

591
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,320
come up with things that would make

592
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,320
clinical development the future clinical

593
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,720
development a bit easier so while we

594
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,679
might be seeing things that may start in

595
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,400
early

596
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,240
research kind of not clear right now

597
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,159
because a lot of partners are redefining

598
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,600
what their research programs are things

599
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,400
where they're already in advanced

600
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,679
pipeline we're seeing a little more

601
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,240
robust collaborations of really trying

602
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:02,559
to um put that Pipeline with them in

603
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,640
collaboration for

604
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,640
Success when I uh when I read a

605
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,279
scientific paper like uh maybe like a

606
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,520
lot of you I I read who the authors are

607
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,080
what the title is and then I go straight

608
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,600
to the conflict of interest section

609
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,880
right because I want to know like what

610
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,000
the company is and what the patent

611
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,840
number is um so you know it's kind of

612
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,880
interesting to think about um what are

613
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,559
what are

614
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,360
the rules or the guard rails that exist

615
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,760
when sort of collaborating with or

616
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
through sponsored research to some

617
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:34,320
degree employing academics whose primary

618
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:38,080
goal is concept is NIH grants and being

619
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,240
an academic so can you speak to um kind

620
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,080
of like H how that works within your

621
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,559
institutions what the guard rails are uh

622
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,679
and also whether they're changing

623
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:49,960
because I think there has been some

624
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:52,679
changes recently uh that people may not

625
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,000
appreciate so conflict of interest is

626
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:59,000
always there I'm a BD person so I think

627
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,440
of compliance after the fact but um

628
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,039
uh we have very clear Pathways that's

629
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:09,520
the point whether you're MIT Harvard um

630
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:12,399
broad mg R because all the academic

631
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:16,279
affiliations are through MIT or Harvard

632
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:18,360
so it's pretty aligned what those uh

633
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:22,559
guardrails are everybody's aware from

634
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,600
The Faculty onwards to um our compliance

635
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:28,720
office for industry interaction to the

636
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:31,320
BB people so generally there are no no

637
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,320
immediate barriers for working with uh

638
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,760
industry when you're working in your

639
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,000
institutional hat in your research

640
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,039
capacity right because that's an

641
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,039
Institutional you're playing a role as

642
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:45,080
research my personal advice to

643
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,919
investigators is you're not ever

644
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,840
spending 100% of your time on an

645
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,159
industry collaboration you're going to

646
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,120
continue doing your teaching your um NIH

647
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,039
grants you know you think of it you have

648
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,720
one hand you're doing administrative

649
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:00,919
work part of your career you're doing

650
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,960
teaching maybe you have two uh NIH

651
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:05,440
grants or Foundation grants and then

652
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,640
maybe one part of what you're doing is

653
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,320
with industry and there's no conflict

654
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,200
when you're doing it that way some of

655
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,399
the conflicts arise when you already

656
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,399
might have a startup and an equity uh

657
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:20,120
position and so those but we have very

658
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:22,440
specific detailed ways of managing that

659
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,720
and also very upfront so people are very

660
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,520
cognizant and know exactly when the

661
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,000
guard rail is going to be right up and

662
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,159
some of those are

663
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,240
you just can't do that and that's it

664
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:35,760
right well actually MIT is famous for

665
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,080
its spinouts I mean they're all

666
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,399
clustered all around here uh aami and

667
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,760
all these other ones so it's it's uh

668
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,559
it's nothing shameful it's like the

669
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,799
badge of honor you know to start a

670
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:47,240
company so uh Bill how does that work at

671
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:50,120
the broad Institute because there's

672
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,559
certainly a lot of activity around um

673
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,640
some of the technologies that have been

674
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:57,240
developed there and lots of startups

675
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,200
coming out so how how do you manage when

676
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,320
the when the in investigator herself or

677
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,440
himself sort of is involved in the

678
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,000
startup and is a key a key person yeah

679
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,919
well what one thing let me just uh State

680
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,840
at the beginning is that um P the

681
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,159
ability to publish is a Cornerstone that

682
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,000
is a

683
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,440
non-negotiable uh aspect every

684
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,320
collaboration we have right up front

685
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,600
don't don't you might as well go home if

686
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,720
you're not going to let us publish this

687
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,640
um so so that that is one thing and also

688
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,200
like data we make data public available

689
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,760
you know that's that's another

690
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,039
Cornerstone for example all the data

691
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:40,440
from the cancer uh dependency map is is

692
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:42,799
publicly available um in terms of uh you

693
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,960
know faculty being involved in startups

694
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,480
there's a conflict of interest committee

695
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,240
which I actually happen to be on a

696
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,159
member of uh that reviews all of these

697
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,120
things and we're very careful to make

698
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:55,600
sure especially that for example

699
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,840
students aren't directed to do things

700
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,039
that would benefit the startup that the

701
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,559
p is starting in fact there are even

702
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:06,360
examples of where you have another

703
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,760
faculty member watching out over uh that

704
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:12,519
that uh student or postdoc or something

705
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,399
like that so you know we we always um

706
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,039
you know every every situation we look

707
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,960
at we look at very carefully to make

708
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:20,200
sure there's no conflict of interest or

709
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,080
even perceive conflict of interests in

710
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,159
fact you know one of the questions like

711
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,679
could this end up you know on the cover

712
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,080
of the Boston Globe you know as a

713
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,200
potential conflict of interest so so we

714
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,279
have a lot of guard rails I would say in

715
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,880
that way but just very fundamental

716
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:39,399
cornerstones of publication we're

717
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,679
nonprofit um you know you have to be

718
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:44,880
very careful about you know the

719
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:48,159
government gets the same deal as you

720
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:50,480
know Deerfield gets for example um so

721
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,200
we're just we're we're very very try to

722
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,240
be squeaky clean about all of

723
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,399
this Colin how about you what are what

724
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,720
are the guard rails that are around you

725
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:03,720
or or that you use up here uh in your

726
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,760
own work so I think the guard rails that

727
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,440
have been that bill is articulated very

728
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,600
much mimic the guard rails that are at

729
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,039
um MIT in terms of the ability to

730
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,919
produce

731
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:17,919
scholarship um avoiding conflicts that

732
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,799
involve

733
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,760
students and and so forth I think the CH

734
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:26,600
it's it's much more mysterious to me on

735
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:29,840
the MGH side than it is on the Mi MIT

736
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:33,080
side I think the culture of of MIT which

737
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,559
has been to uh you know recognize that

738
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,200
that um uh intellectual the valuable

739
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:40,880
intellectual property and bringing that

740
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,960
um out into the into the into the public

741
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,559
at large is much easier to overcome

742
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,480
we've had faculty on on the uh MGH um

743
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:51,760
side at Harvard who want to start do a

744
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,000
startup and were told by Department of

745
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,519
his you can keep your Harvard

746
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,320
appointment oh if you if you if if if

747
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,760
you want to whether that's typical I I

748
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,039
mean I just I just just I just don't

749
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,399
know but but having gone through this

750
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,799
exercise on both and that's that's not

751
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:08,120
see I know that's not your I'm just

752
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:10,519
exciting the data as as as I as I know

753
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,559
it and having tried to go through this

754
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:16,919
on the MGH side the the the pathways are

755
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:20,640
much more obscure uh even in in terms of

756
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:24,080
having funding from from outside of the

757
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,600
NIH um or you know some of the the

758
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,039
specialty organizations the American

759
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,799
Heart Association or or something is

760
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:31,960
always a challenging thing thing to

761
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:34,159
maneuver and I think it's an obstacle

762
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,760
because ideally you want all of these

763
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,640
all of these parties that have unique

764
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,000
things that they could contribute to the

765
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,279
development of of of Novel therapies or

766
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,720
Pharmaceuticals come together and shake

767
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:48,679
hands and be amiable you know but but

768
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,279
that that is a that is a difficult

769
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:51,799
optimization problem that I have yet to

770
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:54,120
solve yeah yeah well associate

771
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:57,000
professorship at Harvard uh versus

772
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,840
equity in a startup of unknown you know

773
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,159
uh prospects be a difficult one uh to

774
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,000
measure please a little bit

775
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,480
so just to be clear masteral Brigham

776
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,399
actually has a lot of spin outs so

777
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,840
unlike uh MIT or the broad we actually

778
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:17,039
have our own fund what that means is we

779
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,120
make investments and startups that come

780
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,519
out of our technology that founded

781
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,880
actually we have a core team that helps

782
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:26,960
build the company spin it out and we

783
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,200
take Equity so actually we're very well

784
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,200
wored at being a able to do that um

785
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,880
extremely knowledgeable team we're on

786
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:37,919
fund three we have external Partners

787
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,000
it's actually and we syndicate with all

788
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,080
the VCS in this area and internationally

789
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,720
and so we actually have a tremendous

790
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,639
track record so I would just want to

791
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,279
balance that conflict

792
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:51,120
aside tremendous like probably beats

793
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,039
everybody in the Boston ecosystem at

794
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,480
what our startups have raised and

795
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,200
successful products that have come out

796
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,399
of it hands down you can look it up so I

797
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,039
would just say balance that with the

798
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:03,559
fact that we actually know how to

799
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:06,360
navigate that but we our faculty as I

800
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:08,679
said our Harvard appointed faculty so

801
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,840
they have to meet the academic criteria

802
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:13,480
set by Harvard and the bar is a bit

803
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,440
higher because of clinical research so

804
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,639
when you're doing fundamental research

805
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,440
making technology Tech development it's

806
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:24,559
considered very far from patient impact

807
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,840
right the the biases would have to be

808
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,919
pretty far out but when you're doing

809
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,919
clinical research and clinical trial

810
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:36,600
your patient facing your biases might be

811
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:39,960
a bit more Aver to taking that risk so

812
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:41,960
that's where the difference between MIT

813
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,600
and not just Harvard but Harvard when

814
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:48,320
you're in a um academic Medical Center

815
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,919
because a lot of our researchers do very

816
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,880
close to Patient clinical research it's

817
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:56,240
very close to human impact and that's

818
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,639
why the bar might feel a bit different

819
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,000
to you yeah well Bill mentioned the

820
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:01,760
front page of the Boston Globe of course

821
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,120
as a journalist I mean we are hunting

822
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,639
for these conflicts of interest of

823
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,799
course because

824
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:08,880
actually I can't even keep track they

825
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,240
make better stories but no they people

826
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,679
people from the highest uh echelons of

827
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,000
cancer research and stuff uh get toppled

828
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,200
uh even for just you know what they put

829
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,480
in those little conflict of interest

830
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,760
disclosures they forget to mention you

831
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,360
know fiser blah blah blah blah blah and

832
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,440
uh wow you can have uh it can have

833
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,840
consequences so seems like a weighty

834
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,919
subject matter um our goal is to keep

835
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,240
people like Anton away from us so but

836
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,480
they have but their first priority is to

837
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,120
publish so they keep giving me the

838
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,919
information so that's bance we have a um

839
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,320
yeah love hate really so uh I think uh

840
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,559
one of the things I was really uh

841
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,600
promised to ask about is

842
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,039
silos my business we might call it like

843
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,960
a rats hole or something uh it is a

844
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,039
place where things get stuck and they

845
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,279
don't work and uh you know your ideas or

846
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:56,320
your Investments somehow you've gotten

847
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:58,200
into a corner of the ecosystem and

848
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,159
you're not really benefiting from it so

849
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,039
the question I've been given for each of

850
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,960
you is what advice do you have or how do

851
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,320
you

852
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,599
avoid silos and what does a silo mean we

853
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,040
know what it is this a metaphor but what

854
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:12,919
does it actually mean in

855
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,000
practice

856
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:18,560
um I can take start and take a shot at

857
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,200
it um so you can think in silos in many

858
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,879
ways silos can exist so forget the whole

859
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,720
ecosystem and the different

860
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,720
interinstitutional even within semestral

861
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,040
breum because we have five hospitals and

862
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,159
integrated system obviously they're

863
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:36,520
silos people have built Things based on

864
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:40,919
NIH grants careers you know but because

865
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:44,000
our mission is patient care um community

866
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:46,119
research and Innovation and education

867
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,560
the way we train our trainees is by

868
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:52,320
doing patient care and uh doing research

869
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,599
so we do have each of those vertical is

870
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:59,480
constantly intersecting with each other

871
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,040
right so that's one way organically you

872
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,800
know the silos are not there if you're a

873
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,680
fellow who's also doing research in a

874
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:10,400
lab and also seeing patients with one

875
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:13,400
division more intentionally at M General

876
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,640
Brigham like for decades we've been more

877
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,880
intentional of saying well how do we get

878
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,240
more multidisciplinary or how do we like

879
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,520
deliver on a focus that might be a

880
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,160
research area so for research we created

881
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:29,520
things called do we just label them but

882
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:32,800
it helps us internally be able to create

883
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,320
Pathways to avoid what might get stuck

884
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,040
so for example um we have thematic

885
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,160
centers should we have a regener

886
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,640
medicine thematic Center that means the

887
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,920
people do their research in that

888
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,880
thematic Center because they're with

889
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,720
other people their resources built to

890
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,200
drive regenerative medicine research but

891
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,359
their clinical appointments one is in

892
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,040
Psychiatry one is because it's the

893
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,920
different organs the different parts

894
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,640
that regener medicine could be should we

895
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:59,760
try to bring multidisciplinary in a

896
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,280
research base where all the clinical

897
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,839
appointments and the clinical care they

898
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:08,400
do each one of them in that department

899
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:11,240
is in different um clinical vertical um

900
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,960
so those are maybe an example of where

901
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,079
intentionally and organically we've

902
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,800
tried to break

903
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,880
silos yeah I mean the bro is set up to

904
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,319
avoid silos right but that said because

905
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,839
when you have a large group of people

906
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:28,440
you sort of naturally at times drift

907
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,280
into silos not by intention but I think

908
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,960
it's more like what you were saying see

909
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,119
but and so what one thing we try to do

910
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,119
is make deliberate efforts for example

911
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:38,720
to make sure you know like we'll have a

912
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,520
project where work's being done at the

913
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,680
broad and at MGH or at Dana Farber is

914
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,480
that we have to set up meetings where

915
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,160
everyone meets right at least by Zoom um

916
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:51,040
and so we there's a real deliberate

917
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,720
effort to bring everyone in and it's

918
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,800
really tough with you when you have

919
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,560
multi-institutional uh collaborations

920
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,160
going and you know there's always a

921
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,920
commitment like we've got you know like

922
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,480
for example we we have a commitment for

923
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,480
example with our Calico partnership they

924
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,200
come here once a year and we go there in

925
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,200
once a year where every you know the

926
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,400
joint steering committee everybody gets

927
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,119
together to try and break those those

928
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,920
silos down but it's more of a natural

929
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,800
segregation because you can only meet so

930
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,440
many and work with so many people and

931
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,560
keep track of so many

932
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,960
things so I I I think oh I'm sorry you

933
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,119
going so I I think um Sil in part arise

934
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,880
from just human nature and and and I

935
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,400
think especially in the you know in the

936
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,400
academy when one has something they find

937
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,520
that's interesting especially if one is

938
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,400
trying to build up their promotion to a

939
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,800
professor they want to have papers that

940
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,240
are identified with their uniquely

941
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,560
identified with their work similarly

942
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,200
institutions want work identified as

943
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,000
coming arising from from there so I

944
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,359
think Silo is something we're all silos

945
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
are something we're always all always

946
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,960
fighting and I think in in so far

947
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,119
uh we can incentivize individuals early

948
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,960
on to see the benefit the tangible

949
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,960
benefit to them from from actually being

950
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,079
open in their Communications we can get

951
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,680
people in a in a room and to talk and to

952
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,560
do such things in my my experience but

953
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,640
you know how far that gets to removing

954
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,880
the siloed thinking I think is the is is

955
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,839
is the barrier and so I think early on

956
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,040
this this

957
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:25,599
incentivization as in as much as we can

958
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,720
do it is is a is is a path forward

959
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,200
interesting well silos can't be that

960
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,839
they're built to keep things safe it's a

961
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,160
safe place to be um any questions can I

962
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,359
add it's more than safe it's really to

963
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,400
build that deep expertise sometimes you

964
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:40,880
can't unless your self aggregate so it's

965
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,560
not intentional but the deeper you go

966
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,560
sometimes harder to go broader right so

967
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,800
but I would just like to say it ech goes

968
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,520
everything but especially even like he

969
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,200
mentioned with Calico I mean that's one

970
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,599
of our thesis if you come work with us

971
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,359
and you want to be in a strategic

972
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:56,400
partnership there's a Cadence of

973
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:58,079
meetings and the meetings aren't just to

974
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,200
get the people to talk the Cadence of

975
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,640
meetings are to take some decisions to

976
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:08,280
get different input to go noo decisions

977
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:10,079
for projects to kind of get you know uh

978
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,400
and especially for example I'm thinking

979
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,000
of one project where we started with a

980
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,599
lot of Technology development with the

981
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,960
company it's an engineering device

982
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,800
company but then as the product got to

983
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,520
where it needed a lot of user needs a

984
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,400
use case you know we're working with a

985
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,839
thoracic surgeon So within the system

986
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,760
the focus of the project moves from

987
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:35,560
technology development of a robotic into

988
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:37,960
really being driven by using a lung uh

989
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,520
setting and so but the team meets as a

990
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,839
whole should the PHD and the MD the one

991
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,760
who's doing the surgery and the one

992
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,079
who's thinking about software and

993
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,960
clinical engine they are all meeting

994
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,000
together but it's in different phases

995
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,200
right you first had to do some tech Dev

996
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
before you could get there so when

997
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,599
there's Catalyst to make that the silos

998
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,640
actually just different subject matter

999
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:03,040
experts that if there is a reason they

1000
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,240
will work together and I think as long

1001
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,560
as we facilitate what that reason is you

1002
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,880
know why you should work together

1003
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,319
because it'll bring to you some output

1004
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,119
and then of course you have to Resource

1005
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:16,720
it that becomes the challenge if you

1006
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:19,280
cannot resource people people have their

1007
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,119
daily commitments you got to be able to

1008
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,640
Resource it free up some time articulate

1009
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,680
what you can do what it's going to take

1010
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,680
to do and why you're doing it and I

1011
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,640
think then people want to contribute to

1012
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,680
something tangible that can come out so

1013
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,760
I've actually found that the silos are

1014
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:38,760
great subject matter experts if you can

1015
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,680
articulate and be a catalyst to bring

1016
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,880
what

1017
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,839
that joint expertise could do we've seen

1018
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,280
it work tremendously well just just a

1019
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:51,079
point of clarification um so so um it's

1020
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:54,200
not my statement that silos represent

1021
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:56,760
nefarious Thinking by individuals my

1022
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,119
statement is that um individuals have to

1023
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,640
prioritize the things that they do every

1024
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,119
day and and and and and this speaks into

1025
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,319
all aspects of their life in terms of

1026
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:07,880
where they put their intellectual

1027
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:09,640
efforts and their intellectual cycles

1028
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,560
and and I think that uh you know in so

1029
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,079
far as you could have all

1030
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,480
participants um have the same vision so

1031
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,160
in the last 35 years I've seen lots of

1032
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,280
people get together you know depends on

1033
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,119
what what's your metric of success for

1034
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:25,200
what these and what what does it mean

1035
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:27,000
for it to work right and in my view it

1036
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,040
the work it means that it solves a real

1037
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,319
problem and it comes forward with some

1038
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,960
with something and and if using that as

1039
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:35,920
my metric that's where my statements are

1040
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,079
applied terrific hey thanks to all three

1041
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,160
of you uh Colin Bill and SEMA it's time

1042
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:44,000
for the networking break and you can

1043
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,280
grab the speakers um hear more from them

1044
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,560
and from one another and we'll be back

1045
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:54,599
at uh 11:35 for humanizing drug

1046
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:54,599
development thank you thank you
