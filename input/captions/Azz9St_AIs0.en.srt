but also develop the skills that you'll

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,680
need for career success, not just in

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,600

help you throughout your career. So with

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,280
that, I'm going to talk about how do we

48
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,399
partner with you in the CDO on the next

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,920
slide. Thank you. So, how do we do that?

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,079
Um, one way that we do that is we

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,399
provide advising for our students. So,

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,479
as an MINI student, you'll be assigned a

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,040
dedicated career advisor who will be a

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,680
resource for you throughout your entire

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,440
career journey as an MIN student. And

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,599
they'll really work with you to help

57
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,879
customize a um recruiting strategy for

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,440
your own unique goals as well as based

59
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,360
on what your prior background is. And if

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,160
you're in the career exploration phase,

61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,760
they will help you navigate learning

62
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,519
about the industry so that you can

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,040
discover what it is that you want to

64
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,120
pursue. We provide career education

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,440
throughout your time in the program. It

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,680
actually starts four months prior to

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,120
when the program starts. So when you get

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,280

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,360

accesses access access to resources.

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,000
This is all to help you learn about how

73
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,640
to recruit and how to um prepare for

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,360
interviews and be really successful in

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,720

76
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,080
community to help connect you with the

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,200
incredible network that is MIT, MIT

78
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,760
Sloan and Minn. And so we do that

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,400
through our programs. Our career classes

80
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,959
are integrated with alumni, industry

81
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,120
professionals and recruiters as well as

82
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,120
we have networking events throughout the

83
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,239
year that give you opportunities to

84
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,159
connect with people in market directly.

85
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,280
Um there's an incredible program called

86
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:39,280
the Sloan Industry Adviserss Program and

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:43,280
these are um MIN excuse me MIT Sloan

88
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:47,200
alumni including MIN who are in various

89
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,519
roles that are really active mentors and

90
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,760
want to serve as adviserss to students

91
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,640
in a really safe way where there's no

92
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,040
judgment. So you can talk to them about

93
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,920
just general questions of what is it

94
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,000
like in the work that they do or you

95
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,480
could do something like a mock interview

96
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,319
with them. And then we also launched

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,200
this year quant mentor program

98
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,080
specifically for mfins. Those are

99
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,680
second-year MIN students who have

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,120
successfully completed a quant

101
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,000
internship who are an active mentor and

102
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,400
resource for the new MIN students who

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,759
are interested in quant opportunities.

104
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,759
So there are a lot of ways that we are

105
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,840
helping to build career community in the

106
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,919
CDO. Um we're also um proactively

107
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,360
sharing market insight. So, we're

108
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,720
constantly talking to employers and we

109
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,880
share what we're learning about

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,520
recruiting and hiring trends back with

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,000
students. Um, we want you to have the

112
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,320
information that we have about what's

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,479
happening in the market. And with that,

114
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,240
we're organizing company events as well.

115
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,560
So, this is facilitating opportunities

116
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,560
for connections with you as I mentioned

117
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,040
with alumni, but we do this also

118
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,880
directly with employers. So there are

119
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,360
many company events um on campus that

120
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,240
are available to to help you learn about

121
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,720
different roles organizations and to

122
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,800
also make connections that will help you

123
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,919
stand out in the application and

124
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,639
interview process. And as for the types

125
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,160
of employers that we engage, it's across

126
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,479
all industries. Um so but specifically

127
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,880
for M fins you know you can think about

128
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,000
that within finance we're talking to buy

129
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,039
side sell side you know hedge funds uh

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,919
the bulge bracket banks we're talking to

131
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,560
fintech um those in sustainability

132
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,199
private equity VC um management

133
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,280
consulting economic consulting um

134
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,280
anything you you really name it tech is

135
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,080
also a growing space we're seeing more

136
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,000
and Finn's interested in so we have

137
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,800
relationships with companies across Ross

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,960
all those industries. So this is a broad

139
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,960
overview of our services and how we

140
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,639
partner with students in the MIN

141
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,639
program. And on the next slide I'm going

142
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,800
to start to walk through what your

143
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,680
specific journey would look like as an

144
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,560
MIN with career support.

145
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,400
So as I mentioned the support starts

146
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,759
with your letter of admissions to the

147
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,720
MIN program which would be in March four

148
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,360
months prior to the start of the program

149
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,680
in July. And we want to provide you with

150
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,319
this support really for a couple of

151
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,080
reasons. One is because we recognize

152
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,520
that there are some um companies and

153
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,840
specifically functions such as

154
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,400
investment banking that recruit really

155
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,800
early and so we want you to have the

156
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,960
information and access to resources that

157
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,360
you need to be successful in that early

158
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,160
recruiting market. Another reason we

159
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,560
provide this support for you is because

160
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,720
the summer is very busy and the more

161
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,520
work that you can do in advance to get

162
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,240
career ready that often set students up

163
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,400
for a stronger start in the the program.

164
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,919
So we have what is called career

165
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,960
foundations which is a self-paced online

166
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,919
career course that is designed to really

167
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,639
prepare you for the career journey at

168
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,840
Sloan. It starts with, you know, career

169
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,520
exploration resources as well as

170
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,120
preparation tools if you're ready for

171
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,000
that next step to get all of your

172
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,400
recruiting materials ready. Um, and it's

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,199
all broken out as well by industry and

174
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,319
function. So, the guidance will vary

175
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,800
based on what your career interests are.

176
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,400
And we include a checklist as well for

177
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,880
you, so you can make sure that you feel

178
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,520
like you're staying on track even before

179
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,680
you come to campus.

180
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,120
um in the months prior to the program

181
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,120
starting that career advising

182
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,759
relationship will begin. So we have

183
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,280
monthly opportunities for you to drop in

184
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,280
and connect with the career advising

185
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,440
team and ask whatever questions are on

186
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,400
your mind that you're curious about. And

187
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,840
we also launch our um initial individual

188
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,759
advising appointments and offer resume

189
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,479
feedback from a career adviser all

190
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,520
before the program begins. You will also

191
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,800
have access to recruiting resources. And

192
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,199
this is really incredible because it

193
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,599
gives you the opportunity to not only

194
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,160
learn about recruiting timelines for

195
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,479
industry and employers specifically, but

196
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,120
it gives you the access to apply for job

197
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,680
postings that open up early and you're

198
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,520
able to make sure you don't miss out on

199
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,680
those opportunities.

200
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,479
And another thing that we do that has

201
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,360
been really I think well received and

202
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,800
appreciated by MIN students is career

203
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,120
path webinars with alumni. So we do

204
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,279
these for three different um functional

205
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,919
areas. Quant research and quant trading

206
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,560
is paired together um investment banking

207
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,399
and consulting. And this is led with the

208
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,640
CDO where we have a panel of MIN alumni

209
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,959
who are talking about each industry

210
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,839
there that they are working in to give

211
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,560
you general information about those

212
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,240
career fields, how they have progressed,

213
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,120
what their recruiting experience is

214
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,120
like, any tips and advice that they have

215
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,600
for you. You get it firsthand from

216
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,720
former M fins that were in your seat not

217
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,880
long ago about how to break into that

218
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,440
space and we give you the opportunity to

219
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,839
ask them questions directly and all of

220
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,360
that happens even before July. So

221
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,560
there's an incredible amount of

222
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,160
resources that are available to you as

223
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,760
soon as you become admitted. We really

224
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,160
welcome you into our MIN um world and

225
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,680
access to support. Um but it doesn't

226
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,040
stop then. On the next slide, I'll talk

227
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,040
about what happens during summer term.

228
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,680
So, when the program starts in July, um

229
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,000
that's when you'll go through our MIN

230
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:45,200
Career Core. And Career Core is a um

231
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,839
consists of four in-person classes led

232
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,920
by the CDO that brings in alumni,

233
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,160
industry professionals, and recruiters

234
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,720
to help you discover industry

235
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,519
opportunities and prepare for

236
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,160
recruiting. It's a highly interactive

237
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,640
learning experience that will have you

238
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,959
out of your seats in every class and

239
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,440
interacting with each other and as well

240
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,880
as the professionals. And so it's it's

241
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,160
just a lot of fun. There's a lot of

242
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,040
positive energy around it when sometimes

243
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,040
career and recruiting can feel um

244
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,519
sometimes overwhelming for students or

245
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,600
perhaps daunting or stressful. It's a

246
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,519
really fun engaging experience that we

247
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,360
create during the summer. You'll learn

248
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,760
how to market yourself. you'll have the

249
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,040
opportunity to network and you'll

250
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,839
complete career core um with this solid

251
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,519
foundation and career tool toolkit that

252
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,519
will really help you be market ready. Um

253
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,279
coupled with career core throughout

254
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,760
summer you will have the access you'll

255
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,440
have access to career advising support.

256
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,839
So this includes one-on-one career

257
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,560
advising that I mentioned as well as

258
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,800
resumeé reviews, cover letter reviews.

259
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,680
You can have access to mock interviews

260
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,000
and strength coaching. So career support

261
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,920
is really intense um during summer term

262
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,320
as you're going through career core, but

263
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,920
it doesn't stop there. Um on the next

264
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,920
slide, I'll speak to how the support

265
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,240
continues throughout the program.

266
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,920
So you will continue to have access to

267
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,040
resources and workshops throughout the

268
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,600
um your time as an M Finn. And this is

269
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,480
we we have these career workshops really

270
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,560
to support your ongoing development of

271
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,000
career skills and to help you navigate

272
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,839
recruiting. So an example of that is we

273
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,519
have a workshop prior to your summer

274
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,399
internship on how to make the most of

275
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,360
your summer internship where we bring in

276
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,360
um alumni again to talk about what they

277
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,360
learn from their experience about how to

278
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,440
prepare for the summer internship and

279
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,160
actions that you can do to position

280
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,160
yourself for a return offer. Um, so

281
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,240
we'll have thematic workshops like that

282
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,320
throughout the year or full-time

283
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,560
recruiting strategies session when

284
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,640
you're in the full-time market um, based

285
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,920
on whatever the need is. So those career

286
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,920
workshops are going to continue

287
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,680
throughout your time in the program as

288
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,120
well as the individual career advising

289
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,480
that I mentioned that is always

290
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,160
available to you as an MIN. And then as

291
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,920
um, various times throughout the

292
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,560
program, we do small group career

293
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,880
sessions and these are often done on a

294
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,760
career skill level. So the focus might

295
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,680
be resumeumés for example or we do it by

296
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,279
function so that you're having a shared

297
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,279
career interest in these small group

298
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,279
sessions.

299
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Um and while I'm speaking on behalf of

300
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,839
the co I'd really be remiss if I didn't

301
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,680
mention that career is really everywhere

302
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,240
at MIT Sloan. So the co is just one

303
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,000
piece of that. We think that Sloan does

304
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,240
a really wonderful job of integating

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,360
integrating career throughout your

306
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,240
experience. So you'll learn and um

307
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,800
develop um skills even through your

308
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,800
academics, clubs, conferences,

309
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,079
competitions, career fairs in the

310
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,720
broader MIT community. So there's a lot

311
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,959
on this page here and I won't go through

312
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,240
it all but I just wanted to highlight

313
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,920
that how u many opportunities there are

314
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,320
for you to explore and experiment and to

315
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,240
find out what your next path is going to

316
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,240
be. On the club level, there's over 50,

317
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,480
you know, career and regional clubs. And

318
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,120
those that are most popular for Mfins

319
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,800
are the quantitative financial markets

320
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,200
club, the investment banking club,

321
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,839
private equity VC, investment

322
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,680
management, fintech, um,

323
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,639
entrepreneurship. I think those are the

324
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,120
ones that come to mind as being most

325
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,040
popular for Mins that really help them

326
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,800
on the career side. And then there are

327
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,360
some really fun social clubs that they

328
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,519
enjoy as well. Conferences and

329
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,040
competitions are a great opportunity for

330
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:54,480
you to practice what you're learning and

331
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,000
maybe do a stock pitch or um have the

332
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,240
chance to connect with industry

333
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,720
professionals outside of the classroom

334
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,560
or outside of the CDO. Those can be

335
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,880
really rewarding for students. And

336
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,800
again, just the broader MIT community.

337
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,560
as an MIN you're you're joining a

338
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,760
network of over a thousand MIN alumni

339
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,760
over 24,000 Sloan alumni and you know

340
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:21,040
over 130,000 MIT alumni and it's a

341
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,920
really proud uh network that has a

342
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,320
culture of giving back and supporting

343
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,040
one another and so it's great

344
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:33,320
opportunity for you to build connections

345
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,320
with within that network.

346
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,399
This is a lot of information and so what

347
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,120
we have done is created a website called

348
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,120
your CDO. You can go to it now. It's

349
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,120
cdo.mmit.edu.

350
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,000
And this is what the co's effort has

351
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,639
been to create one place where we could

352
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,199
centralize a lot of the career

353
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,720
happenings around

354
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,399
MIT Sloan, you know. Um, and so you're

355
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,560
welcome to look at this. Now, some of

356
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,639
the resources you would need to be a

357
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,639
student in order to access, but there is

358
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,680
a lot of information that you will be

359
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:14,240
able to see today. And so, I encourage

360
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,320
you if you're interested to please check

361
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,360
it out. You would be able to find the

362
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,560
employment reports for the MIN program

363
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,120
where you can learn about what prior MIN

364
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,920
graduates have accepted for their first

365
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,560
job coming out of the program. And on

366
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,639
your CDO, we have career resources based

367
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,120
on your program. So there's a specific

368
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:39,360
MIF page as well as industry pages with

369
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,079
resources based on whatever your

370
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,639
industry area of interest is. There's a

371
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,040
lot to explore on this page and on this

372
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,040
website. And so I encourage you to check

373
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,120
it out now if you're interested and know

374
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,800
that it's really the tip of the iceberg

375
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,320
as to what you can see right now. now

376
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,399
and then when you're a student you have

377
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,399
access to full visibility on your CDO.

378
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,560
Great. So next I wanted to turn to um

379
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,399
the career outcomes. You know I just

380
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,959
spent a lot of time talking about the

381
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,759
career support available to you as a

382
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,320
student and now I want to turn to how

383
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,800
that support translates into outcomes

384
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,000
and what our MFIN students are um

385
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,000
choosing to do following graduation.

386
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,959
So this right here gives us a highle

387
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,160
snapshot of some of the job titles and

388
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:32,560
employers that have hired Mfins in in

389
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,320
recent years. You we are a master of

390
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,480
finance program. The majority of our

391
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,759
students are going to work in the

392
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,680
finance industry. And I will go on a a

393
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,399
following slide about specifically where

394
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,120
an industry and what functions and you

395
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,120
can see also the different job titles

396
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,440
that our students are accepting for

397
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,320
their positions. Majority of students

398
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,320
are entering at that analyst level role

399
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,959
into the market. But there are those who

400
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,440
are also going at that senior analyst or

401
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,839
associate level position depending on

402
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,880
what their prior background was before

403
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,880
they came to the MIN program. All of

404
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,839
these companies that I see on the slide

405
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,120
here, these represent companies who hire

406
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,600
our students year after year. we have

407
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,839
great relationships with them and um

408
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,319
you'll have the opportunity certainly to

409
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,400
connect with them and learn about um

410
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,760
roles where you could make make an

411
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:31,200
impact at their organizations. So um

412
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,120
worldrenowned names I think come to MIT

413
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,520
and you have great opportunities to

414
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,520
connect with them.

415
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,559
So um I mentioned the employment reports

416
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,200
um when I spoke about the your co

417
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,120
website and each year we do publish what

418
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,919
our employment outcomes and this gives a

419
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,559
snapshot of the class of 2024. It

420
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,039
includes both the February 2024

421
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,559
graduates as well as the May 24

422
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,360
graduates and 98% of those um graduates

423
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,080
accepted uh post-graduate offers within

424
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,919
six months of graduation. 100% of the

425
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,720
Feb students did a summer internship.

426
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:13,120
You can see the average salary and

427
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,200
median signing bonus are very

428
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,559
competitive market rates in terms of

429
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,480
what our students are earning from

430
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:22,080
compensation.

431
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,320
And uh 54% of our graduates from the FEB

432
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,720
class ended up joining their summer

433
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,120
internship um when they when they

434
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,640
graduated for in a full-time position.

435
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,640
Now, that number doesn't reflect the

436
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,640
number that received full-time offers.

437
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,799
It just reflects the number that chose

438
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,679
to accept them. And so, they went and

439
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:43,280
back to their internship company. And

440
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,000
41% of our class of 24 graduates

441
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,679
accepted roles in quantitative roles.

442
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,600
So, think about quant research or quant

443
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,760
trading. That's included in that. I

444
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,080
would say 25% accepted in investment

445
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,559
banking. And so really twothirds of our

446
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,039
students are interested in more

447
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,960
quantitative roles or the investment

448
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,280
bank and corporate finance paths. And

449
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,440
I'll get into the functions on a another

450
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,720
slide, but if you're interested, I

451
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,360
really do encourage you to look at the

452
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,880
employment reports. And this data does

453
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,039
reflect 100% of our outcomes for our

454
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,360
graduates. So we're really proud of that

455
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,919
that we're capturing every single

456
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,520
student's outcome in term and sharing

457
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,520
that data with you.

458
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,080
These are um more companies. It's just a

459
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,799
snapshot of some of the hiring companies

460
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,520
that have come to campus and hired our

461
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,320
our graduates recently. Um almost all of

462
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,520
these companies have hired at least two

463
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,640
students in this past year of 2024 and

464
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,480
also for each of the past three years.

465
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,360
So as I mentioned, these are really

466
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,120
strong um partners. You'll see bulge

467
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,799
bracket banks like Bank of America,

468
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:58,000
Barlays, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs,

469
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:02,000
Morgan Stanley as well as um you know

470
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:07,120
hedge funds, Balias, Citadel, uh Two

471
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,440
Sigma, QRT. Um so there's a lot of great

472
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,360
opportunities for you to connect with

473
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,080
employers. And in the employment report

474
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,600
on the last page, we show a full list of

475
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,200
all the companies that hired our

476
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,200
graduates this year. Here

477
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,120
you can see the types of functions that

478
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,799
they're going into and industry. So as I

479
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,400
mentioned on the right side of the slide

480
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,240
here you'll see the industry. I'll start

481
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,720
there with majority of students are

482
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,640
going into the finance industry but you

483
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,600
can see there's also an interest in

484
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,360
consulting. Um last year 7.7% of our

485
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,120
graduates accepted opportunities at

486
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,679
consulting firms. Usually those are uh

487
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,280
Mackenzie Bane and and and BCG, but they

488
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,919
can also be some boutique consulting

489
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,840
firms or um economic consulting or

490
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,320
financial services consulting like

491
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,760
analysis group or NRA as well. And we

492
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,760
we're seeing a little bit of a growing

493
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,480
interest in the tech industry too. So

494
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,960
you'll see that there with the 6% but

495
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,120
largely you know over 80% of the

496
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,600
graduates accepted opportunities within

497
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,159
the financial services space. And then

498
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,679
as for the functions, I mentioned that

499
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,360
there's a really strong interest in

500
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,440
quantitative roles as well as corporate

501
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,080
finance roles. So you can see that at

502
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,799
the top there um private equity and

503
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,440
venture capital is a space that many of

504
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:24,559
our students are interested in um and

505
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,760
tend to get there as a later path but

506
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,440
from that initial path following MIN

507
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,000
they tend to find their way there

508
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,159
through another avenue such as banking

509
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,240
or consulting before landing in PE.

510
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,760
there are some ENIN graduates who go

511
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,600
directly into uh PE or VC coming out of

512
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,600
the program

513
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,000
as well as other roles that they're

514
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,000
interested in. I will say what's not

515
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,600
shown here on this slide is that there

516
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,200
are um students each year who do choose

517
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:58,159
to continue education and pursue a PhD

518
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,559
or who decide to start a business and go

519
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,480
more the entrepreneurial route. that's

520
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,880
not um shown on this slide, but each

521
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,880
year there's a handful of students who

522
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,679
pursue those opportunities and we can

523
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,919
support you in that as well if those are

524
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,919
your goals.

525
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,360
And so where in the world are these

526
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,360
students um working? The MPIN program is

527
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,159
a global program and so you'll see

528
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:30,960
that's reflected in our career outcomes

529
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:33,120
as well. Um the class of 2024 over 90%

530
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,679
of students were international. Less

531
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,720
than 10% were US citizen or permanent

532
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:43,200
resident and still 50% of the class

533
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,440
chose to stay in uh the United States or

534
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,799
Canada. And I think that what is

535
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,559
important to know when you're looking at

536
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,159
these outcomes is that we do support UN

537
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,480
students who are interested in an

538
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:58,159
international job search. So, you know,

539
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,840
a quarter of our graduates um went to

540
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:05,360
work in Asia and about 20% went to

541
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,080
Europe. And we have strong ties with

542
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,720
employers as well as alumni networks in

543
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,640
those regions. And I think that there's

544
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,640
it's often a question from students

545
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,640
wondering if they can secure an

546
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,799
opportunity in the US. And I think the

547
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,200
answer there is that we have a lot of

548
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,679
students who choose to do that path and

549
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,159
are successful. And then there are also

550
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,320
students who recognize that MIN is a

551
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,480
global program and that's part of what

552
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,400
they love about it and they want to work

553
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,720
internationally and so their goal isn't

554
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,960
always to work in the US and you see

555
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,960
that reflected here in our outcomes.

556
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,400
And I think that that was it Rachel for

557
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,080
me. I think this might be um a slide

558
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,080
that you want to speak to Rachel or

559
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Diane.

560
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:56,320
Yes. Amazing. Thank you so much, Laura.

561
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,039
Um, and we will get to questions in just

562
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,840
a moment. Um, but I see Diane popped on.

563
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,720
Did you want to speak?

564
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,559
>> Yes. Sorry. I was trying to furiously

565
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,799
answering. Great questions. Thank you so

566
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,559
much for submitting them. We're really

567
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,440
um, you know, glad to see them. I know

568
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,720
there's a lot here to digest. Um, and I

569
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,960
know there were quite a number of

570
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,279
questions maybe, um, first and foremost

571
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,400
just in terms of the class size and the,

572
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,880
um, profile. This is a great way um for

573
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,320
you to kind of get a sense. It's really

574
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,880
a snapshot if you will of the class. And

575
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,440
you know, I will say that, you know,

576
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,919
while there have been some, you know,

577
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,080
differences year-over-year, the the fact

578
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,880
of the matter is it still remains very

579
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,640
much um similar to what it has been.

580
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,440
It's an early career, you know,

581
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,520
pre-professional program. Most of our um

582
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,480
MVIN students are coming directly from

583
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,880
university and they do not necessarily

584
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,520
and you do not necessarily have to come

585
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,840
with a lot of coursework in finance for

586
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,559
example or even internships in finance

587
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,120
for that matter. Uh as one of our

588
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,440
finance faculty likes to say we are

589
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,080
looking for individuals who have great

590
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,120
problem solving and analytical skills.

591
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,120
We can teach you finance. So, um I think

592
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,520
that really speaks to what you see here

593
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,919
in terms of the class profile and and

594
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,520
should absolutely give you a good gauge

595
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,919
around what are the things that going

596
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,279
to, you know, help me to thrive in the

597
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,080
program because that's really what it's

598
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,080
all about. Um there's a lot of, you

599
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,440
know, deep dive into quantitative

600
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,080
finance obviously as part of the

601
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,760
curriculum. Yes, we are asking in the

602
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,919
application and I know I'm not going to

603
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,520
get too much into this for this session,

604
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,440
but uh there have been a number of

605
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,120
questions about it. You know the fact of

606
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,840
the matter is is we are looking at

607
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,240
everything in your application. Do not

608
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,840
overlook one component. You just you

609
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,600
should really be focused on everything

610
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,799
that we are asking as part of the

611
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,880
application that's required. Uh and go

612
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,120
ahead and take your time in submitting

613
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,720
it but submit it by the January 5th

614
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,720
deadline. There's absolutely no

615
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,120
advantage to submitting it early. We do

616
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,679
not have a rolling admissions uh process

617
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,000
at all. So I know there were quite a few

618
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,880
questions about that. Um I will also

619
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,559
just mention that you know again we look

620
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,200
at everything but what we're mostly

621
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,200
focused on is what are your you know the

622
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,039
strength of your um academic background

623
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,440
and we're looking at both your

624
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,600
undergraduate or bachelor's level as

625
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,600
well as your um any anyone who's had

626
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,000
advanced degrees of any kind. We're

627
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,320
going to be looking at um if you submit

628
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,919
test scores great they're not required

629
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,360
but certainly it's up to you if you feel

630
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,279
that that helps to support your

631
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,720
application. And then we're also going

632
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,159
to be looking at, you know, what's your

633
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,720
understanding of and passion for

634
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,279
pursuing a course that's a deep dive

635
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,760
into finance. What is it about the

636
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,279
financial world and the field that most

637
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,080
interests you or that you have knowledge

638
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,919
about? Um, and then last but probably

639
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,279
not least, because again, I'm skimming

640
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,840
over this for the purpose of this

641
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,320
session is you're you have to have

642
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,240
excellent English communication skills.

643
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,679
Um, and there are many ways for us to

644
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,840
determine that as part of the

645
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,000
application and admissions process. um

646
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,520
we do not require the IELTS or TOEFL.

647
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,039
However, again, if you feel that's

648
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,039
another great data point and you want to

649
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,919
submit them or submit a test score,

650
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,919
that's fine. Go ahead and do that. Uh

651
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,679
the point I'm trying to make is that

652
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,919
again, this is an early career

653
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,880
pre-professional program. We're looking

654
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,440
for individuals who are really looking

655
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,039
to learn more and want to pursue or

656
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,720
launch their careers in the field of

657
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,640
finance. And there are many ways and

658
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,960
many sides of finance as Laura's just

659
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,840
described that you could do that. So, I

660
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,159
I don't know if there's any other

661
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:41,000
questions that I missed, Rachel, or that

662
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,000
you think need to be addressed further.

663
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,600
>> I think maybe you both can can take a

664
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,440
stab at a few questions we've been

665
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,960
getting for our international students.

666
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,320
Thank you so much for being here and for

667
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:56,480
joining us. Um but in terms of you know

668
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,320
our of application um what is what is

669
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,960
the outlook in terms of international

670
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,240
students applying to MIN Diane and then

671
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,000
Laura um given the the visa situation um

672
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,200
you know kind of what is the what is the

673
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,760
thought process for our CDO office?

674
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah, I mean again to be perfectly

675
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,640
transparent. I mean this is all new to

676
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,399
all of us too. So we you know and Laura

677
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,200
can attest to this I'm sure you know

678
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,120
we're not seeing any immediate impact as

679
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,919
a result of this change. It's so recent

680
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,360
nobody really knows for sure. Um but be

681
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:34,000
rest assured that you know both our co

682
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,360
as well as our ISO as well as just you

683
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,520
know overall MIT is monitoring this very

684
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:44,000
closely. Um, we were so relieved really

685
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,000
that our students were able to get to

686
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,080
campus this year based on other things

687
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,760
that were challenges that were happening

688
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,000
on the visa front for many of our

689
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,399
international students. Um, but you

690
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,360
know, we we don't know. It's too early

691
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,000
to tell. And um, at this point, we have

692
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,320
a whole team that's part of Laura's

693
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,880
group that's employer relations. They

694
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:08,000
are working very closely with them as

695
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,600
well as the ISO. So, you know, it's MIT

696
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,600
after all. We have a lot of resources

697
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,520
that are dedicated to our students and

698
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,360
helping them. I don't know if there's

699
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,279
anything else you wanted to add, Laura.

700
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,640
>> No, I think that was really well said.

701
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,880
It's evolving and we are really being

702
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,760
proactive and trying to understand what

703
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,799
is going to happen. So, I think from the

704
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,320
CDO side, there's three main ways I

705
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,360
would say that we are supporting

706
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,559
students. Um, one is by proactive

707
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,360
outreach with employers to ask them how

708
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,080
the proclamation is impacting their

709
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,399
hiring or consideration of hiring or if

710
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,840
at all any effect to their policy. So,

711
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,919
that's something we are proactively

712
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,559
doing and sharing insights back that

713
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,720
we're gaining from employers directly to

714
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,120
students so that we can help educate and

715
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,120
prepare and inform students. But that's

716
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,360
happening now. And a lot of employers,

717
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,120
they don't know themselves yet all those

718
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,039
decisions. that that's one way that we

719
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,360
are supporting students in that area.

720
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,159
The other area is you know thinking

721
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,640
ahead that whether there may be a

722
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,200
increase of interest in working

723
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,840
internationally um and will we see a

724
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,480
decrease in students wanting to stay in

725
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,120
the US post um the program that's

726
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,039
something we don't know but in uh

727
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,760
preparation for that we're making sure

728
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,399
that our relationships with companies um

729
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,200
internationally and in key cities like

730
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,679
you know London and Hong Kong and Paris

731
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,279
are really strong and engaging in those

732
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,200
networks so that we can support

733
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,399
students. And then the third piece that

734
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,799
I would say that really is a you know

735
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:46,000
thread to your whole experience as an

736
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:48,000
MIN is that career advisor relationship.

737
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,399
So working with students on an

738
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,880
individual basis to understand what are

739
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,880
their goals not only function but

740
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,960
geographical goals and how can we

741
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,279
support them in navigating that

742
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,520
successfully. So, those are all things

743
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,480
that our team is doing really

744
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,559
proactively um as we monitor what's

745
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,840
happening in the world.

746
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,039
>> Great. Thank you. How are we doing on

747
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,000
questions, Rachel?

748
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,760
>> Yeah, that's super helpful. Um I I want

749
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,360
to just um point out something Laura

750
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:20,159
mentioned about the individualized

751
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:22,000
support here in the in the MIN program,

752
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,360
but this also applies, you know, at this

753
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,039
stage of the process. So, you're

754
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,960
thinking about MIN and you're not sure

755
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,559
about your profile. We've gotten a few

756
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,640
just personal questions about their

757
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,240
specific profile. So, we do want to

758
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,080
encourage you to reach out to us via

759
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,080
email if you have some questions about

760
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,080
your eligibility or what this would look

761
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,679
like for you. So, that applies to the

762
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,279
admissions process as well as career

763
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,039
supports and so many other things. So,

764
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,640
please reach out to us and we also have

765
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,880
a number of events coming up to really

766
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,279
break down the application. So, so be on

767
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,519
the lookout for more from for us. Um but

768
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,000
with that in mind for the individualized

769
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,840
support Laura um we have some students

770
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,279
asking some prospective students asking

771
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,000
questions about you know varied

772
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:03,120
interests. So so let's say a student is

773
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,600
thinking about um VC but also has some

774
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,840
interest in some other areas. What would

775
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,519
you say the career adviserss are able to

776
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,279
do for folks that are a little

777
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,760
open-minded when it comes to future

778
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:17,120
goals? Yeah, that's a great question.

779
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,360
And I think it's okay to be open-minded

780
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,159
um at the start of the program. I will

781
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,840
also say some students come into the

782
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,519
program knowing exactly what they want

783
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,840
to do and that's what they're focused on

784
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,480
and they're successful in that avenue.

785
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,159
And other students come into the program

786
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,760
thinking they know exactly what they

787
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,279
want to do and they discover something

788
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,360
else that they didn't even know was

789
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,200
possible and they change their mind. And

790
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,240
our program really supports you with

791
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,640
that. So, one thing that we're doing um

792
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,600
really early on is trying to provide you

793
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,679
with opportunities to explore and learn

794
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,919
about the market opportunities that are

795
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,320
available to you. And I think one of the

796
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,039
best ways to do that. It's not by

797
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,799
reading uh blogs online. It's not by

798
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,039
looking at company websites. It's by

799
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,200
talking to people in the seats doing the

800
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,120
jobs themselves and learning from their

801
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,519
experience. And that's why so much of

802
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,760
our career curriculum is integrated with

803
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,760
alumni and industry professionals. So

804
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,440
you have those opportunities to connect

805
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,919
and learn about what they're doing

806
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,919
across different roles. And so that's

807
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,840
really what we focus on in the beginning

808
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,519
of the program. And yes, we do

809
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,000
complement it with resources that you

810
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,440
can access online and in your own time

811
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,679
so that you can feel like you're doing

812
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,279
your own research and preparation. but

813
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,600
giving you the opportunity to connect

814
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,080
with the market is a fantastic way for

815
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,559
you to discover what do the jobs look

816
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,480
like and feel like. Um, and then I will

817
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,000
also say throughout the program you're

818
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,559
going to have opportunities to learn

819
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,080
throughout your academics. Um if you

820
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,679
choose to do proseminar or finab which

821
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,360
um you will have to choose one or the

822
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,840
other as it's an action learning

823
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,360
requirement as an MPIN student those are

824
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,120
opportunities for you to apply what

825
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,760
you're learning in the classroom to work

826
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,240
on real problems with employers and that

827
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,559
gives you another insight into the

828
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,480
industry and then also your summer

829
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,480
internship experience. That's a great

830
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,879
way for you to test if this is something

831
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,679
that you want to continue to pursue. And

832
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,879
while I mentioned that, you know, 54% of

833
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,280
students did accept um and rejoin their

834
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,159
summer internship employer, that's still

835
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,560
about half the class that did not. And

836
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,079
you know, so what they they maybe

837
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,720
realized that that wasn't the career

838
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,240
path for them or they realized that they

839
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,560
wanted to work for a different company,

840
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,639
for a different culture. And so whatever

841
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,399
your career journey looks like, we're

842
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,359
able to support you with it. And I think

843
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,839
that's why we value the career advising

844
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,839
model so much because we recognize it's

845
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,560
a diverse class. Your interests are

846
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,480
diverse and so your own experience and

847
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,800
how you navigate it will be unique and

848
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:54,280
we want to support you as an individual,

849
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,280
not just as an entire MIN class.

850
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,400
>> That's great. Thank you so much.

851
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,640
>> Yeah.

852
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,160
And I mean, you you basically answered

853
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,079
this question already, but maybe we can

854
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,160
be a little more explicit. When it comes

855
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,400
to someone that's really interested in

856
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,800
something more niche that may not be

857
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,200
represented on some of the slides that

858
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,480
we've shared today, um what would you

859
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,079
say your advice is or um how does how do

860
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,079
the adviserss handle this if it's

861
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,520
something that doesn't necessarily fit

862
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,720
into those buckets that they're

863
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,440
interested in?

864
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,280
>> Yeah. Um

865
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,560
well I think I would want to know what

866
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,920
the niche is right so um are we talking

867
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,920
about working specifically with

868
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,760
derivatives and exotics you know in a

869
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,359
quantitative trading capacity and that's

870
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,760
their focus or they only want to do

871
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,240
distress debt and credit and their focus

872
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,440
there specifically or sustainability and

873
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,240
climate or is it something else that

874
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,760
isn't a fit for the MIN program. So I

875
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,000
think at this stage I would encourage

876
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,640
you to you know not only look at the

877
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,200
employment reports but you know try to

878
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,200
find MIN alumni through LinkedIn

879
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,880
profiles and see if there are people

880
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,599
doing the work that you're interested

881
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,640
in. We have an incredible network not

882
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,040
just with MIN but I would also lean into

883
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,440
Sloan and MIT if you're in more of a

884
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,520
niche space to connect you with people

885
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:18,320
in those areas and also making sure that

886
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,480
the MIN program is appropriate for you.

887
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,800
I think the MIN program can help support

888
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,800
MIN students in reaching their goals

889
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,880
that are aligned but then there are some

890
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,960
programs that maybe MIN is not the fit

891
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,880
for you. So I would need to understand

892
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,880
what that specific niche is.

893
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,760
That's great. That's super helpful.

894
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,520
Thank you.

895
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,400
>> It seems like we're getting through most

896
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,240
of these questions. I do still see a few

897
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,400
um application

898
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,079
um questions. So, be on the lookout. We

899
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,000
will we'll be here to answer more of

900
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,680
those of those questions. Um and then

901
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,760
another thing that you've answered and

902
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,680
and you did just briefly explain. So, we

903
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,400
we got a few questions around, you know,

904
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,560
placement and do we place folks in

905
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,040
positions? And while the answer is that

906
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,720
we're not a placement agency, Laura gave

907
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,839
an overview of all the different ways

908
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,680
students are getting exposed to um to

909
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,280
employers through their coursework and

910
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,000
through their projects and things. But

911
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,800
can you give us any examples, Laura, of

912
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,040
a success story around um students

913
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,839
finding their their future employers

914
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,960
during their time at in the MIN program?

915
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,720
Yeah, I c I can give you one thing that

916
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,680
I'm really excited about that we just

917
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,720
had two weeks ago is our annual MIN

918
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,920
networking night. And so this happens

919
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:39,119
every year in September where I think we

920
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,680
had 30 employers and over 50

921
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,960
professionals from those employers come

922
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:48,240
to talk just to MIN students for you

923
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,880
know a couple hour evening event. And

924
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,680
this is a fantastic opportunity for

925
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,119
students to connect with a variety of

926
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,119
different companies, different

927
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,160
individuals there. Many of them are

928
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,480
professionals um that were not alum and

929
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,000
many of them are MIN alum as well. So

930
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,520
you can learn about how they navigated

931
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,839
the MIN experience. And while it is a

932
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,560
networking event and it is not intended

933
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:15,040
to be a career fair where you're talking

934
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,040
specifically about applying for a job

935
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,040
there, every year there's always

936
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,359
students who find their jobs through

937
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,599
these connections because they're able

938
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,960
to discover something that they weren't

939
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:29,119
aware of beforehand or they're able to,

940
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,520
you know, make an introduction introduce

941
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,920
themselves and help them stand apart in

942
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,920
the application process. So, I think

943
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,079
that's an event that it's just really

944
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,240
fun. There's a lot of buzz in the room

945
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,280
and high energy and then it really can

946
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,240
have a material impact in their students

947
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,240
recruiting experiences.
