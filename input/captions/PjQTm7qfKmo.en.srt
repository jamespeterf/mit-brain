1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,799
Thank you for the warm introduction and

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,200
um really really happy to be here today

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:10,639
and share with you all a little bit of

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,120
uh my work on using AI and O techniques

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,000
for social impact and then time

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,640
permitting hopefully at the end also go

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,320
back to how some of the challenges we've

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,760
identified in addressing these problems

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,640
also inspired methodological advances uh

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,119
in AI.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,160
So uh at USC as Sarah mentioned I

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,160
co-direct the center for AI in society

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,239
whose missions uh is to advance the

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,399
scholarship and application of AI for

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,200
the uh well-being of vulnerable

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,440
communities both human and other

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,480
species. Uh and we really focus on advi

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,039
advancing um responsible AI in

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,280
partnership with community uh

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,239
stakeholders, organizations and policy

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,760
makers. So um we share this kind of

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,719
enthusiasm and commitment to uh try to

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,879
work on problems that are well grounded

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,439
uh and in partnerships to make sure that

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,799
they address the real pain points that

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,240
uh will make a difference in the real

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,720
world. And so within the center we've uh

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,040
broadly organized different uh research

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,439
projects and and collaborations we have

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,240
in three teams health and well-being,

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,080
environment and homelessness. And uh I

32
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,640
will try today to give you uh several

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,360
examples within uh spanning some of

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,680
these uh domains.

35
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,400
So in my own work I I have uh focused on

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,759
using AI for conservation for habitat

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,960
and biodiversity conservation but also

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,759
uh more recently on disaster resilience

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,840
in particular thinking about mitigation

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,479
planning across uh lifeline

41
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,360
infrastructure against disasters such as

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,600
uh wildfires, floods and earthquakes. Um

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,479
and then finally climate change and its

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,799
impacts on human displacement, species

45
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,040
displacement, energy and health. And

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,600
what's the common thread between uh

47
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,280
these many different application domains

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,759
is that they involve the design of

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,040
policy and actions to manage a very

50
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,640
limited resources available for um a lot

51
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,720
of these kind of public good or social

52
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,400
good domains. uh where while where while

53
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,959
we are trying to maximize the best

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,120
impact

55
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,599
um uh under complex objectives and

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,800
complex constraints and so really this

57
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:32,319
real world application problems uh

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,319
become uh very interesting and very

59
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,879
impactful predictive and decision

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,160
problems and so as as Sarah said like

61
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,239
early on in my career I really um got

62
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,720
dedicated to kind of advancing the field

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,519
of computational sustainability where

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,239
really the goal goal was to kind of um

65
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,920
advocate and grow a community of AI and

66
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,959
computer science researchers more

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,720
broadly that are really grounded in

68
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,920
problems from uh social impact and

69
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,800
sustainability. Um thinking about how

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,239
our techniques from AI applied there but

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,159
also by looking at these problems um in

72
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,400
very very fine granularity thinking

73
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,080
about how we can improve our methods in

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,920
order to to uh address those domains. So

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,480
again today I'm going to try to give you

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,720
some examples of things we've done uh in

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,519
partnerships in both the predictive as

78
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,360
well as the decision side of things. And

79
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,400
so without further ado I have like a

80
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,400
very packed agenda of several examples

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,879
um kind of give you a foray of different

82
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,280
things we've done. Uh I'll start with a

83
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,920
recent example we we've worked on on

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,920
health and well-being and this is a

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:45,120
collaboration um with Amref which is uh

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,640
um an NGO that works across Africa in

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,959
order to uh promote health uh as well as

88
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,680
the Kenyan Ministry of Health and our

89
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,480
collaborators at Microsoft AI for goodl.

90
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,480
So what we were um doing in this

91
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,159
partnership is looking at how to

92
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,920
forecast malnutrition hotspots in

93
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:07,120
Kenya. In particular, recently uh

94
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,080
there's been a lot of advocacy about uh

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,640
uh the the problem of acute malnutrition

96
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,360
and the need to uh try to understand

97
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,239
better the driving factors and intervene

98
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,320
when whenever that possible.

99
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,079
So in particular in Kenya uh

100
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,560
malnutrition is a leading cause of

101
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,360
morbidity and mortality among children

102
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:32,080
uh with uh over 970,000 children um

103
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,040
under five uh that are suffering some

104
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,840
form of malnutrition in 2023. So this is

105
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,680
a pervasive problem. Amref is one of the

106
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,639
organizations on the ground trying to

107
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,040
address it by providing uh food baskets

108
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,800
and other nutritional support for

109
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,199
families who have uh children

110
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,000
experiencing malnutrition. And so one of

111
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,960
the uh the key uh thing that we

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,320
identified is how can we make that their

113
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,639
work more effective again having limited

114
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,680
resources to deploy on the ground. Can

115
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,280
we facilitate um targeting these

116
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,320
resources in the most effective way

117
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,120
possible? So what we identified as a way

118
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,919
to enable that activity is to improve

119
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,560
our ability to forecast spatially where

120
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,600
would be the hot spots of malnutrition

121
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,360
among children with enough in advance in

122
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,280
order to um uh allow for responses in

123
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,720
terms of uh providing resources and

124
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,520
allocating resources in the right

125
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,080
spaces. So we want to basically create a

126
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,759
model that's able to predict

127
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,280
malnutrition on the subcounty level one

128
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,280
month, three month and six months in

129
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,280
advance to allow for organizations like

130
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,720
Amref to then prioritize their resource

131
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,240
allocation. So we will work closely with

132
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,840
Amref and the Ministry of Health to uh

133
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,960
collect um historical data and identify

134
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,440
the the the modeling problem.

135
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,160
So right now the way that the this is

136
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,560
done in organizations such as Amref is

137
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,520
to look at the tracking numbers of

138
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,680
incidents or prevalence of malnutrition

139
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,560
over the previous months and use that as

140
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,680
a way to estimate what will happen next.

141
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,120
So it's uh using historical information

142
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,000
but not in automated or uh uh

143
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,919
sophisticated way datadriven but not any

144
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,440
kind of statistical modeling and

145
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,680
obviously they realize that they are

146
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,199
leaving a lot um that can be

147
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,840
exploited. So basically we came in and

148
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,039
said okay can we do this better. So

149
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,600
Kenya like many uh uh low resource and

150
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,080
middle inome countries across Africa and

151
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,680
and other continents are actually using

152
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,120
DHIS2

153
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,759
um as a system to manage their health

154
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,520
information. Um and so one thing um that

155
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,319
about this project is that we've built

156
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,639
it for Kenya with Kenya data but because

157
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,759
it's built on top of DHS2 which is

158
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,880
actually used across many other

159
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,560
countries we're hoping that we can

160
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,720
actually expand the footprint of this

161
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,919
work across uh other places

162
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:08,440
with similar challenges. So here we are

163
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:12,880
looking at um four years of historical

164
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:14,720
data uh from about 14,000 GOTAC health

165
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,039
facilities which keep track of the

166
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,840
number of cases of malnutrition among

167
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,400
children as measured by their uh mid

168
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,639
upper arm circumference and then other

169
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,720
clinical features like uh for example

170
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,520
infant feed feeding practices um uh low

171
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,400
birth weight etc. So the idea is can we

172
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,560
use this uh historical time series of of

173
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,720
our outcome which is the malnutrition as

174
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,560
well as clinical features to be able to

175
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,880
pred. So the goal is going to be to

176
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,280
predict whether a particular subcount is

177
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,720
within some level of prevalence. So

178
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,800
we're going to aggregate data on the

179
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,479
subcounty level summing up all the cases

180
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,440
reported across all facilities falling

181
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,000
in particular geographic region and then

182
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,879
uh um tearing that into this uh kind of

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,680
predetermined IPC 5point scale which

184
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:08,000
looks at classifies levels of prevalence

185
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:12,120
between 0 to 3% 3 to 10 10 to 15 to 30

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,199
and above 30 based on uh a previous

187
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,879
classification. Okay. So here I'm going

188
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,639
to skip a lot of the details but here's

189
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,199
some of the of of the results. By

190
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,919
basically combining this historic data

191
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,080
on outcome time series analysis plus the

192
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,280
clinical features we were able to show

193
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,879
that um we uh with even simple

194
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,800
lightweight models such as logistic

195
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,360
regression and gradient boosting trees

196
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,919
we're able to improve the accuracy. This

197
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,479
is um average you see across these five

198
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,680
different class predictions over kind of

199
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,160
the baseline which is window averaging

200
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,680
as a way to kind of quantitatively

201
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,080
um capture what they're doing right now

202
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,320
which is looking at historical trends of

203
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,040
uh of outcomes of malnutrition outcomes

204
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,360
and using those to predict the future.

205
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,480
So as you can see here, window averaging

206
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,519
or just simple statistic um historical

207
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,360
averaging is fails to predict accurately

208
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:13,040
across the medium to low uh prevalences

209
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,120
of malnutrition and and this non more u

210
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,640
complex nonlinear models like gradient

211
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,959
boosting are able to improve that

212
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,959
accuracy significantly. So although we

213
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,279
haven't like in this case invented a

214
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,240
brand new methodology bringing the right

215
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,920
AI techniques is actually uh helping our

216
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,120
partners to resolve a problem that on

217
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,640
the ground has a big impact for

218
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,480
them and so right now we are working

219
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,480
closely with the ministry of health to

220
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,160
try to actually deploy this on a

221
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,000
continuous way where they would upload

222
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,320
data and um uh forecast uh every one to

223
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,760
three months and uh inform their

224
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,600
resource allocation respectively.

225
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,360
So in addition to these clinical

226
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,920
features and historical data, we also

227
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,480
wanted to see well is it possible to

228
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,040
bring different data sources and and uh

229
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,720
that are not clinical that are able to

230
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,399
help us uh um make these predictions in

231
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,920
situations where for example let's say

232
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:11,279
access to this ministry of health uh

233
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,680
information DHS2 is not accessible. So

234
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,399
in particular we looked at remote sensed

235
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,399
data in particular data like modis that

236
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,959
is collected every eight days has

237
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,200
relevant outputs like the gross primary

238
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,720
productivity which could be correlated

239
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,560
with kind of like food scarcity and food

240
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,760
availability over some time windows. So

241
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,640
we aggregated GPP derived uh uh

242
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,200
statistics on a monthly uh basis to the

243
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,079
subcounty level and used that as like

244
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,560
kind of a an alternative for toal

245
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,240
predictor and we were able to show that

246
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,040
actually just based on this like

247
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,959
completely uh data publicly available

248
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,800
from another source. we are able to at

249
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,800
least match the the simple baseline of

250
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,680
window averaging which still requires

251
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,880
having access to uh malnutrition

252
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,959
historical time series

253
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,279
data. Um we obviously ideally would want

254
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,880
to basically have this data fusion

255
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,959
between clinical and um and um

256
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,880
additional environmental such as GPP and

257
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,680
see which one how much they can

258
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,000
synergize. uh preliminary results on

259
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,120
that show that at least with enough

260
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,440
clinical features uh um satellite data

261
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,519
maybe is not needed to improve accuracy

262
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,600
but I feel like there's actually more to

263
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,800
be done in terms of really evaluating in

264
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,000
which situations um that can fill in um

265
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,800
unexpected gaps and just by itself it's

266
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
already good to know that it it is uh an

267
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,519
alternative source. So for example um

268
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,519
with the kind of

269
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:50,320
um cut to US aid for for some time for

270
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,279
example DHS2 and other health data that

271
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,680
this uh um you know um organizations

272
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,200
were relying to was actually offline. So

273
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,800
what happens when suddenly things like

274
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,519
this are offline right at least maybe

275
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,959
you can use like satellite

276
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,640
data. Okay. So, what's the potential

277
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,959
impact of this project is that we're

278
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,720
really hoping to improve the efficiency,

279
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,560
accuracy and delivery of nutrition

280
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,040
supplements uh in this um um vulnerable

281
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,040
communities. We are hoping in next steps

282
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,279
to actually work closely with Amaref in

283
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,519
order to study the kind of like impact

284
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,920
on the way that they operate and how

285
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:29,279
many uh effective uh um uh deployments

286
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,839
of nutrition uh will happen under this

287
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,680
better prediction and and think about

288
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
how we can integrate the predictive

289
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,600
models with operational decisions such

290
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,120
as resource allocation which is very

291
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,000
interesting because at the end of the

292
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,320
day we don't just care about predicting

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,920
malnutrition per Today we want to enable

294
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,200
them to make more effective resource

295
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,440
allocation. So we're really excited

296
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,519
about this to actually um have a

297
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,440
long-term collaboration on the ground

298
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,639
and hopefully expand to other uh

299
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,920
countries as well. On the I'll switch

300
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,839
gears and uh show you some examples of

301
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,680
our work on decision making for the

302
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,240
environment. By the way, happy Earth Day

303
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,399
to everybody. I realize that I somehow

304
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,399
like serendipitously chose my seminar

305
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,200
date. I don't think anybody was doing it

306
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,120
on purpose but it was uh perfect. In

307
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,720
fact in retrospect if I had put two and

308
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,480
two I could have done a whole talk just

309
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,680
about by diversity conservation in uh um

310
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:30,240
inra day but I will share a little bit

311
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,160
of of of my work. I have uh um done uh

312
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,720
several different things related to to

313
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,200
conservation um and I'll talk briefly

314
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,600
about two of them. One of the uh the the

315
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,160
leading um

316
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,480
um threats to biodiversity is habitat

317
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,440
loss and fragmentation uh due to

318
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,839
anthropogenic uh pressures such as uh

319
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,320
deforestation,

320
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,680
urbanization, um agriculture and overall

321
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,240
climate change and therefore

322
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,839
conservation planning has a critical

323
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,399
role to play in protecting key habitat

324
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,320
uh before it gets destroyed. But how do

325
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,040
we make these decisions effectively

326
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,639
right in a datadriven way and again use

327
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,880
uh limited resources in the most

328
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,040
effective way possible. So a lot of my

329
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,120
work has been like bringing optimization

330
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,480
models to the conservation communities

331
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,199
in terms of uh conservation planning and

332
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,920
the most recent uh work that I've done

333
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,639
in collaboration with a large team of

334
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,800
ecologists and economists is to look at

335
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,639
the cost of institutional hierarchy

336
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,880
hierarchies in spatial conservation

337
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,440
planning. So what does that mean? That's

338
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,160
like a mouthful, right?

339
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,920
Um so as you know like conservation

340
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,320
planning is the problem of like choosing

341
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,399
with given some uh dollars allocated to

342
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,399
conservation which land should I protect

343
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,120
in order to maximize some kind of a

344
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,079
biodiversity objective for how many

345
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,000
species are expected to persist etc. And

346
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,199
so most of the literature and kind of

347
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,440
the research tools available out there

348
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,560
are focusing on this problem from kind

349
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,800
of a a single agent or oneshot decision-

350
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,399
making where I'm just saying okay I have

351
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,399
this money and I'm going to specially

352
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,320
decide which parcels I'm going to buy

353
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,519
and evaluate my objective right and I

354
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,240
want to do this in the most cost

355
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,000
effective way possible and increasingly

356
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,399
these models are actually really being

357
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,000
applied to large scale specially

358
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,519
explicit initiatives like the 30 by30

359
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,240
uh initiative and the uh key

360
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,720
biodiversity areas. However, one thing

361
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,480
that's missing uh is ignoring

362
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,040
institutional and governance structures.

363
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,600
So, usually you don't have that straight

364
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,839
connection between conservation dollars

365
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,560
and on the ground decision- making. For

366
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:47,040
example, uh even in the US is um we have

367
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,399
like federal government versus states.

368
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,560
So instead of using a single planner or

369
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:56,480
acting over whole region allocating

370
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,320
directly uh uh money or thinking just as

371
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,079
broken down multiple independent

372
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,839
planners we really want to take into

373
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,360
account this this kind of uh

374
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,199
institutional structure hierarchical

375
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,199
structure. So in this work we basically

376
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,279
focused on these uh collaborative

377
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,120
governance structures where we we want

378
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,000
to explicitly model the layers of

379
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,320
interact interacting conservation actors

380
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,040
who might have um misaligned related but

381
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,199
not perfectly identical uh conservation

382
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,800
priorities, right? They might operate on

383
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,279
different scales. They I guess might

384
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,720
have different value systems. Uh they

385
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,240
might have different instruments or

386
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,160
levers that they can uh control.

387
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,720
So in particular, we're going to look at

388
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,199
kind of like the US federal grant giving

389
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,199
to states where uh the federal

390
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,759
government is operating across the whole

391
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,480
USA. Their instrument is giving

392
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,320
allocating budgets to states but not

393
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,759
directly maybe protecting specific

394
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,720
parcels um and and and caring about like

395
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,639
federally listed species of importance

396
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,440
versus the states are operating over

397
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,839
their own specific region. um they

398
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,720
actually have the ability to spatially

399
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,640
make decisions about um conservation

400
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,799
priorities within within their states

401
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,520
and they might have locally important

402
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,799
keystone species and other endangered um

403
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,799
uh other uh species of interest economic

404
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,559
or uh cultural interests that they want

405
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,559
to protect. So there's this uh related

406
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,480
actors working with different

407
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,960
instruments at different scales and yet

408
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,880
they have to work together to achieve a

409
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,400
final outcome that hopefully is good for

410
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,280
everybody. So we can actually model this

411
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,919
hierarchical structure at least for for

412
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,640
federal versus regional decision making

413
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,120
or uh global versus regional decision-m

414
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,039
as a stack of barar game where one actor

415
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,120
moves first the leader and then the

416
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,640
others respond. So in our case, the

417
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,880
federal government is going to be the

418
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
leader allocating budgets to states and

419
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,760
the states are the followers which

420
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,200
receiving that budget then make their

421
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,840
own decisions maximizing their local

422
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,600
objectives and essentially um uh the the

423
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,520
leader the government could um

424
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,240
indogenize uh the the anticipated

425
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,919
behavior of of the followers in order to

426
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,760
make the best decisions for themselves.

427
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,960
Right? So if they ignore the fact that

428
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,480
these followers are going to be

429
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,080
optimizing different objectives than

430
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,360
themselves then they're going to be

431
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,720
doing a suboptimum resource

432
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,200
allocation. So to express this you

433
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,919
basically can think of it as a bi level

434
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,559
optimization problem where the leader is

435
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,960
optimizing some utility big U that is a

436
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,360
function of the decisions on the ground

437
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,200
that are performed at the lower level by

438
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,000
the individual states individual

439
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,280
decision- making the the leader itself

440
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,600
is allocating these budgets BR uh across

441
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,919
a whole total budget so it has this

442
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,400
continuous interventions but at the

443
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,160
lower level each of the states given a

444
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,799
particular budget is making discrete

445
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,640
choices about which land to protect or

446
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,039
not optimizing their own local

447
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,640
biodiversity

448
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:03,280
objective. So in particular in this in

449
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,960
this work we assume that the utility um

450
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,200
of both um the federal government and

451
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,120
and of the state governments are related

452
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,280
to some kind of uh ecological

453
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,799
persistence factor but the weight that

454
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,160
they put on different species or

455
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,440
different ecological factor is

456
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,520
different. Right? So in particular the

457
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,160
federal government might care about uh

458
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,760
endangered species act species versus

459
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,840
the local ones who uh have local

460
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:33,200
species. So we developed this framework

461
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,679
and and methodology where we are able to

462
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,400
um to model this problem as a very large

463
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:42,320
scale mixed integer optimization problem

464
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:46,160
and we applied to at the USA contiguous

465
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,960
uh continental um sorry contiguous um

466
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,960
what do I want to say

467
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,280
uh

468
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:58,080
yes uh uh um space. So this is basically

469
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,400
modeling the uh giving grants like such

470
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,640
as the land and water conservation fund,

471
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,880
federal uh giving and the cooperative

472
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,200
endangered species conservation fund. So

473
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,799
again here our uh funding decisions will

474
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,080
be on the federal level allocating

475
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,160
budgets on the lower level uh individual

476
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,200
discrete decisions about which counties

477
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:21,520
are going to uh uh get specific land

478
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,960
protected uh uh within them. And so uh

479
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,960
we actually use um uh as realistic data

480
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,280
as possible. We have species

481
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:33,360
distribution models for um uh more than

482
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:36,240
1,400 uh terrestrial species across the

483
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,799
US including uh federally important

484
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,799
species from the um threatened and

485
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,880
endangered species act and as well

486
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,360
species that are listed in what's called

487
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,200
swap plants or like the state action

488
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,919
plans that each individual state has.

489
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,000
that includes a much larger list of

490
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:54,480
species and then we have a cost estimate

491
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,919
for acquisition on the county level

492
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,159
based on uh expected

493
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:03,280
returns. So with this uh you know uh

494
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,840
real data set across the US uh we are

495
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,559
able to look at what happens when uh we

496
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,280
ignore versus indogenize this uh

497
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,360
institutional knowledge in decision-

498
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:16,559
making. So if the if we make federal

499
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,559
choices assuming that uh our the federal

500
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,080
objective is kind of like the king of

501
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,600
all kings and everybody's going to

502
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,320
follow uh the same uh the same lead the

503
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,320
the the federal government will make an

504
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,320
allocation something like that where

505
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,240
they would directly if they were able to

506
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,440
decide whether to protect land in order

507
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,960
to maximize ESA

508
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,640
species. However, this is not achievable

509
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,400
because the the federal government is

510
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,240
not directly able to work on the spatial

511
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,919
level. So, they're still going to have

512
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,280
to allocate budgets and then the states

513
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,760
are going to take those budgets and make

514
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,720
their own local decisions. So, then when

515
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,159
the corresponding states budgets are

516
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,520
allocated, they are allocated then to

517
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,159
different counties than what was

518
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,200
expected that idealized solution. So the

519
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:02,960
actual realized solution of the of the

520
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,080
the of the of the budget allocation that

521
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,400
ignores institution will shift the

522
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,320
expected decisions and then the the

523
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,720
realized objective in terms of federal

524
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,360
listed species will be lower. So that's

525
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,039
kind of like the the price of ignoring

526
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,640
institutions essentially. You can think

527
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,400
of that the difference between what the

528
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,280
federal government would have expected

529
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,799
to be the outcome for the ESA species

530
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,480
assuming that everybody's going to be

531
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,159
exactly making prioritizing the same

532
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,840
species as them versus what happens on

533
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,000
the ground when the misaligned

534
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,679
priorities are realized.

535
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,080
So by using our indogenized tackle game

536
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,720
uh model which indogenizes that

537
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,440
misalignment when in allocating budgets

538
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,760
we are able to do something smarter.

539
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,919
Okay. So the bille approach accounts for

540
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,600
the state decision making in the federal

541
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,559
budget allocation and um and basically

542
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,320
is able to allocate budgets to to states

543
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,720
that are more aligned in their

544
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,280
objectives with the federally uh for

545
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,360
with the federal ESA species. So in

546
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,559
terms of quantitative results, you can

547
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,480
think about this as the um the at at

548
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,400
best if the federal government was able

549
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,080
to swoop in and make specially explicit

550
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,520
decision, they can achieve some

551
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,000
idealized maximum. Uh but when it gets

552
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,960
realized with a misalignment, we in our

553
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,360
analysis, it basically loses about 24%

554
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,679
of the expected biodiversity outcomes.

555
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,640
But then when you come in and you do the

556
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,679
stack over by level method, we're able

557
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,960
to then uh recover that by at least

558
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,960
one/ird back to u uh expected or

559
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,360
anticipated biodiversity outcome. So

560
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,760
again indogenizes institutions is

561
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,720
allowing to take into account this

562
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,320
misalignment and um um empower the

563
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,320
federal government to make more informed

564
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,400
decisions. Yeah. Is it okay if I ask the

565
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,559
question? Yeah, sure. Um, so I think

566
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,080
this is really really cool work and and

567
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,760
particularly this like sort of

568
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,200
difference in terms of like decision-

569
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,440
making at different scales feels really

570
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,760
important in these spaces. But I guess

571
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,480
um it does kind of make the assumption

572
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,240
that the best solution is the idealized

573
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,799
solution based on the endangered species

574
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,039
act. But the endangered species act

575
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,200
doesn't list a huge number of threatened

576
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,400
species because the process of listing a

577
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,480
species is so political. Um, and so

578
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,039
actually some of those statebased

579
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,640
applications might actually be better

580
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,120
along some different dimensions of

581
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,760
biodiversity. Did you look at all at how

582
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,600
these different solutions might measure

583
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,120
for like different metrics of like

584
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,880
biodiversity sort of improvement or

585
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. So we

586
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,960
basically have this like plots where

587
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,279
it's looking at like oh what is like you

588
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,279
know the ESA only biodiversity versus

589
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,520
the combined biodiversity across all

590
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:47,360
species let's say the swap plants make

591
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,120
and essentially these different

592
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,799
approaches are are at different points

593
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,919
of the parto curve among them and um

594
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,919
often in fact depending on the

595
00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:01,520
misalignment the you know ignoring in

596
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,000
institutions is is really like Pareto

597
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,640
dominated in a sense it would almost

598
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,480
sometimes be like worse in both cases.

599
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,080
Interesting. Because um because it's

600
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,840
already clear here like in a sense the

601
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,320
federal government will lose so much by

602
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,320
not taking into account the misalignment

603
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,919
that it will get worse response than it

604
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,240
will just let's say optimizing for

605
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,600
optimizing for the swap species and

606
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,000
still getting a benefit for the

607
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,000
federally listed species. But the bigger

608
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,840
overarching question is like are the

609
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,679
objectives that we are modeling the

610
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,799
right ones and that's obviously a much

611
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,600
bigger question.

612
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:39,679
But one can argue that but in all cases

613
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,520
at some point all of these actors will

614
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,520
have to agree on whatever they feel like

615
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,200
is the objective they want to optimize

616
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,600
and at that point it still makes sense

617
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,840
to think about this institutional

618
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,440
dynamics. there will always unless

619
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,440
you're thinking like oh I can convince

620
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,600
everybody to agree on a single objective

621
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,200
that's shared among all of them which I

622
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,720
feel like it's unlikely right and

623
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,880
there's obviously the power dynamics

624
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,400
about no but I'm on top therefore I have

625
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,679
my own objective it should dominate

626
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,120
other things yeah um a question I have

627
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,400
is do you have a do you have intuition

628
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,279
on why you're covering like only one

629
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,120
third like you know the what's going on

630
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:20,799
with the remaining 23 and um a related

631
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:25,120
question is do you model like gaming of

632
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:28,320
the um like of what the uh follower is

633
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,279
doing like uh you know saying that they

634
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,799
will they want to be what the leader

635
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,640
both very good questions so the first

636
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,760
one is the fact that there's uh some of

637
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,960
the u ESA species are in areas where

638
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,279
essentially there's very little other

639
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,880
species that anybody cares about so in a

640
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,640
sense they just like when you look at

641
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,799
what states will decide they just never

642
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,520
decide to go and protect land

643
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:52,360
So that's just because of the spatial

644
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,200
distribution of of some of these

645
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,120
pieces. Um, and the second one is very

646
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,039
relevant. So right now in a sense we've

647
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,960
gone one step further in modeling kind

648
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,039
of like the player dynamics in this

649
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,799
hierarchical structure. But obviously

650
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,840
there's much more complex things like

651
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,679
for example they could be gaming but

652
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,120
they also like more important is more

653
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,360
like how about cooperation right? So a

654
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,200
lot of neighboring uh uh bordering

655
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,440
states actually share a lot of their

656
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,360
species in their swaps because there's

657
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,600
overlapping habitat ranges. So there's

658
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,279
actually interest for them to coordinate

659
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,880
to protect those species that they both

660
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,960
care about. And so in our this current

661
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,039
model I'm presenting is actually not

662
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,919
taking into account in a sense lost

663
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,279
opportunity of coordination on the state

664
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,200
level. So that's actually something that

665
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,640
we are we're exploring now and we're

666
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,919
hoping to to come up with some

667
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,919
frameworks. Obviously it becomes more

668
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,960
and more complex as you think about like

669
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,679
more of the of the uh agent dynamics but

670
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,919
as a first step that was uh you know uh

671
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,240
one way to integrate the institutional

672
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,679
dynamics but definitely very very both

673
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,320
in terms of gaming and in terms of

674
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,880
cooperation wide open areas that for

675
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,440
additional

676
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,840
improvement. Okay. And so um in

677
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,039
conservation the second biggest threat

678
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:11,279
uh after habitat uh fragmentation and

679
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:13,799
loss is uh biodiversity uh loss due to

680
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,480
wildlife uh poaching, trafficking and

681
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:18,480
trade. It threatens animal populations

682
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,520
but it also threatens other sustainable

683
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,399
development goals like uh and threatens

684
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,320
equity, tourism, security and health.

685
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,120
And so I I think many people don't

686
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,120
realize the scale at which illegal

687
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,159
wildlife trafficking is actually

688
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,640
pervasive. It's like uh a huge

689
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,840
multi-billion dollar industry happening

690
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,240
globally across the world. And so IWT

691
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,159
refers to basically the poaching like

692
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,559
killing or taking out of their natural

693
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,559
habitat animals and then trafficking

694
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:52,080
them to other locations wherever the

695
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,159
markets are. And it threatens a lot of

696
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,640
uh um it affects a lot of species that

697
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,919
are highly threatened and endangered and

698
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,720
they're often like um collected either

699
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:06,159
because uh there's a demand for them as

700
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,679
pets alive or for their skins or other

701
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,120
uh products or um traditional medicine

702
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,279
for example. So there's many different

703
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,399
demands of when I get asked like oh but

704
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:19,440
why or like what's which exactly who are

705
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,240
the uh the people or the communities

706
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,080
that demand it? It's it's a very

707
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,960
multifaceted economy with different uh

708
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,960
supply and demand um uh factors. So

709
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,360
actually understanding what is

710
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,799
happening, how it's happening and and

711
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,640
how we can intervene is critical and yet

712
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,799
it's very difficult because very little

713
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,880
data is collected. I think I feel like

714
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,880
habitat modeling and species modeling is

715
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,120
way ahead of the curve in terms of data

716
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,200
collection and modeling efforts while

717
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,799
IWT is this like gray zone where it's

718
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,360
illegal in some countries, not in

719
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,039
others. Data is not collected in a in a

720
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,520
coherent way and there's really not

721
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,200
enough uh light being uh shown on this

722
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,039
uh really important conservation

723
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,200
problem.

724
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,360
Um obviously though uh a lot of

725
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,279
organizations conservation organizations

726
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,000
are trying to quantify the scale and

727
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,080
mechanism and impact of IWT and there's

728
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,039
like uh reports that are trying to

729
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,799
collect data and identify some of those

730
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:21,440
trends. Um but most of the reports that

731
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,600
are out there such as reports by the UN

732
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,120
aggregate observed incidents and

733
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,440
basically present raw IWT uh historical

734
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,880
trends. And that's obviously better than

735
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,279
not having uh quantitative analysis but

736
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,760
hopefully we can do better than just

737
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,919
counting right in order to understand

738
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,600
driving factors and so on. And the

739
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,360
problem with just counting is that the

740
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,360
data on which this is based which is

741
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,840
seizures right seizures of illegal

742
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,640
wildlife trafficking which is again kind

743
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,880
of criminal data it suffers from

744
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,480
detection bias, representation bias and

745
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,120
completeness bias. So um this severely

746
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,520
hinders our um ability to kind of uh

747
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,559
address and understand what's happening.

748
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,080
So coming from from from this

749
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:07,840
motivation, we wanted to see whether we

750
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,480
can use predictive modeling based on

751
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,880
this historic data to somehow help

752
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,480
identify features that make certain

753
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,000
locations uh more likely to be engaged

754
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,480
in illegal wildlife trafficking

755
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,679
activities and also try to fill in some

756
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:27,360
of the gaps gaps by being able to re um

757
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,600
predict uh undetected hotspots. And so

758
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,000
uh we chose to do this on the airline

759
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,320
global airline network because um

760
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,559
airline IWT seizure in was one of the

761
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,679
better documented kind of uh

762
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,880
infrastructures uh where uh IWT happens.

763
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:46,880
Obviously there's uh other uh modes but

764
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,039
um air um is one of the main ones and so

765
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,360
the first thing we did is to collect as

766
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,399
much data as we could. So based on kind

767
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,279
of like publicly or like by request uh

768
00:31:54,399 --> 00:32:00,799
data um data access we were able to

769
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,640
aggregate uh uh 1,300 wildlife

770
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:07,600
trafficking incidents across the world

771
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,440
on the airport uh on airport uh network.

772
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,240
And as you can see here just in terms of

773
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,640
again the raw statistics um you can see

774
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,760
that there's certain hotspots of many

775
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,679
incidents being reported. Again, this is

776
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,840
with keeping in mind the fact that

777
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,399
reporting is incomplete

778
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:28,320
um and uh and and so just at face value

779
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,440
might also be missing some part of the

780
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,080
story. So we use this data to in a

781
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,519
predictive model to try to understand

782
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,600
how this uh historical IWT seizures

783
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,240
relates to features of the airport at

784
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,960
which the the seizures were either uh

785
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,559
confiscated or the recorded origin or

786
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,360
destination for that particular

787
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,200
trafficking incident. So um we are using

788
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,840
any kind of uh all the airports

789
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,919
implicated in IWT not just the seizure

790
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,840
location. And so in this model we

791
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,159
incorporate uh airport features that

792
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,039
vary by location. So looking at kind of

793
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,120
like structural components of centrality

794
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,440
metrics of the airports within the

795
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,640
global airline network. Right? So that's

796
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,120
kind of like structural network

797
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,760
properties but then uh development

798
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,039
sustainable development metrics such as

799
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:20,159
uh indices reported on criminal markets,

800
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,880
criminal actors and resilience. And so

801
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,880
here you can see based on on on uh on

802
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,799
the models we developed some sharply

803
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,640
feature importance which identifies the

804
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,480
fact that structural properties within

805
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,360
the network obviously drive a lot of the

806
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,840
choices. Airports with high uh network

807
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,840
centrality are very likely to be chosen.

808
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,039
They have a lot of edges and a lot of

809
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,720
ways to like go to different locations.

810
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,080
But other things also matter. In

811
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,760
particular, in our analysis, doing

812
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,240
prediction only based on structural

813
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,720
properties was much worse in terms of

814
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,919
accuracy than incorporating uh some of

815
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,960
the other factors like uh uh founder

816
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,760
crimes and uh state actors uh

817
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,159
territorial integrity etc. So basically

818
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,519
this model is allowing us to kind of dig

819
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,840
further into the driving factors

820
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,280
um that might not be understood before.

821
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,000
Can I ask a question? Yeah, sorry to

822
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,839
interrupt you. Uh you you do have

823
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,240
information about the prevalence of

824
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:19,520
certain species in geographies like also

825
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,240
what kind of markets the or what kind of

826
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,399
products and where these are sold uh in

827
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,000
terms of these species and if if these

828
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,879
are actually killed or used for some

829
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,720
other uses right so uh so the markets um

830
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,399
I mean there's some information but I

831
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,240
don't think there's very nicely compiled

832
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,679
information on the markets on the

833
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,599
species yes although the data um the IWT

834
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,079
data is so sparse that here we were

835
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,720
aggregating across all the species. We

836
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,879
didn't try to divide it by let's say uh

837
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,399
because then our data set becomes

838
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,320
smaller and smaller and smaller.

839
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,800
Ideally, we would want that because if

840
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,040
we are actually modeling let's say uh

841
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,000
the trafficking of a specific species or

842
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,920
like a a family of related species, we

843
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,680
could use information about like where

844
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,079
are they even present. So therefore we

845
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,839
kind of know what the supply areas,

846
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,640
right? And we could exploit that in our

847
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:14,640
prediction. Um and hopefully we can do

848
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,480
that um with with more information on um

849
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,119
as seizure data becomes more and more

850
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,440
reported. But do you have information on

851
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,680
lax laws like local laxity of

852
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,359
enforcement laws and you incorporate

853
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,599
that in the Yeah. So some of these

854
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,000
metrics are exactly measuring that like

855
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,560
for example how the strength of of of

856
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,560
like um law enforcement in in the

857
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,480
countries in which the airports are. It

858
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,480
also uh one of the features is like are

859
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,880
they part of sites which is this like

860
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,119
global consortium about commitment to

861
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,040
fight illegal wildlife trade. We we put

862
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,800
as many as these things as possible.

863
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,560
Many of these features are kind of on

864
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,960
the country level as opposed to on the

865
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,520
airport level. So we also try to

866
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,200
incorporate airport specific things like

867
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,280
the population of the city that it's

868
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,520
seen like other characteristics of that

869
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,040
location and so on. So so we try to put

870
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,960
in we didn't know what the driving

871
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,440
factors are. So originally we're trying

872
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,200
to be broad but again we have to keep

873
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,960
into account that the data set is small.

874
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,359
So at some point you start overfitting

875
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,960
as

876
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:16,640
well. Okay. And so then the other thing

877
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,280
that was really interesting to see is

878
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,480
the uh false positive of this model.

879
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,240
right? Knowing that there's like

880
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,079
detection uh u uh bias and so on.

881
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,240
Actually, a lot of these false positive

882
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:32,000
by talking to expert in the IWT

883
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:35,760
community are really not false. They're

884
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
just places where data is IWT incidents

885
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,680
are not being reported very well, right?

886
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Like there's either no commitment to

887
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,599
report that much or uh for other

888
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,560
reasons. So it was very interesting to

889
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,920
use the model to also basically

890
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,480
something that you can do beyond just

891
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,280
doing like again what's in most reports

892
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,960
so far is just kind of

893
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,480
like data representation of what

894
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,400
historically observed but once you have

895
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,960
a model you can actually extrapolate and

896
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,040
do this kind of uh predictive analysis.

897
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,640
So interestingly enough a lot of these

898
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,040
airports are in countries which have

899
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,640
already been identified as high IWT

900
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,200
activities. is just some airports

901
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,920
essentially don't have good uh

902
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,680
inspections. So I beauty activity has

903
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,680
not been reported there although it's

904
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,480
likely to be occurring and other

905
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,320
countries like the US uh is not on the

906
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,720
naughty list but because the US makes

907
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,079
the naughty list so somehow it doesn't

908
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,920
appear on its own list of countries that

909
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,599
participate in IWT although it's

910
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,880
actually a known fact in the community

911
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:38,640
that there is a supply uh draw from from

912
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,720
uh from our own country um and so I'm

913
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,480
not going to say about research but I

914
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,480
wanted to briefly mention If anybody's

915
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,640
interesting, we have related to this

916
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,560
like a very large scale ongoing project

917
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,599
that I'm super excited about called

918
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,320
Operation Pengalin which is uh uh funded

919
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,920
by the Paul Allen Family Foundation

920
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,640
which is a multi-disciplinary

921
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,400
multi-prong approach of trying to

922
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:04,079
understand wildlife trafficking kind of

923
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,760
um grounded in pengalin wildlife

924
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,760
trafficking. Pengalins are the most

925
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,480
trafficked animal in the world. In the

926
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,040
last decade there's been uh uh estimated

927
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,160
more than 1 million pengalins as as

928
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,079
being uh trafficked and and uh demand is

929
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,960
increasing. And so this is a a

930
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,520
collaboration between uh technology

931
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,480
developers like our collaborators for

932
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,880
from Ariada who developed new uh biom

933
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,240
monitoring sensors like new camera traps

934
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:36,160
etc. uh ecologist and um uh conservation

935
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:38,560
criminologist, socioeconomic experts and

936
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,520
uh um conservation institutions such as

937
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,920
ZSL and and AI expertise. And what we

938
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,240
are hoping to do is by bringing all of

939
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,680
our disciplines together, understand

940
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,240
where the penglins are, their ecology,

941
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,480
um how are they being poached and

942
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,240
trafficked and what are like kind of the

943
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,640
local communities attitude and

944
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,119
alternative livelihoods and how we can

945
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,079
facilitate uh better understanding but

946
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,839
also better intervention in uh reducing

947
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:08,880
illegal wildlife trade of penguins. So

948
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,200
this is like an ongoing project um where

949
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,000
we're hoping to make a real impact on

950
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,079
the ground but also learn about and

951
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,040
create a framework of how to approach

952
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,800
IWT research from this

953
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:22,079
multid-disciplinary approach because a

954
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,160
lot of these things are usually done in

955
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,079
verticals. There's a lot of ecology and

956
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,839
biom monitoring studies. There's a lot

957
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,920
of soio economic studies. there's a lot

958
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,240
of like kind of just criminology and

959
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,040
actually we really want to identify the

960
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,040
data fusion and kind of data synergy and

961
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,720
analysis synergy opportunities across

962
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,240
disciplines to to achieve something

963
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:45,200
bigger than the the sum of the

964
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:47,040
parts. Um and so as a as a conclusion I

965
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,280
guess on the IWT part really want to

966
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,599
emphasize again it's a huge problem that

967
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,359
is I think not as broadly understood as

968
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,880
like let's say biodiversity and climate

969
00:39:53,359 --> 00:40:00,320
change is um but illegal wildlife trade

970
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,240
is a huge industry um and uh

971
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,599
understanding and preventing it not only

972
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,920
helps biodiversity but also uh a lot of

973
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,240
other sustainable development uh factors

974
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,000
such as biological invasion, exonic

975
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,599
diseases, other serious as crime and um

976
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,920
ecoturism and other sustainable

977
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,560
development investments. And here AI and

978
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,880
O can help us as I showed examples of

979
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,359
predict using predictive models but we

980
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,480
also can think about uh decision uh

981
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:30,880
things like about where should we uh be

982
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,359
um for example monitoring where should

983
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,560
we be uh having more deterrence such as

984
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:39,440
inspections on uh on airports etc. So

985
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,480
both a predictive ML models and O models

986
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,520
can help uh this fight. I don't know how

987
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,160
I'm doing on time. Guess I have another

988
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,720
15 minutes.

989
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,800
Yeah, I think um we started pretty late.

990
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,200
Yeah,

991
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,200
but a little over.

992
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:05,520
So I've given you an example of like how

993
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:08,400
AI and um can help um um public health

994
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,400
and here and how AI can be used to

995
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,040
inform conser biodiversity conservation

996
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,359
efforts. Uh this is like a full array of

997
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,680
the different um application areas that

998
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,079
I feel passionate about. Um the next one

999
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,040
I want to talk about is an example of uh

1000
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,200
the the kind of research that can inform

1001
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,119
disaster resilience. Again, within

1002
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,760
disaster resilience, uh my group has

1003
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,839
worked on um things like optimizing

1004
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,160
prescribed burn to minimize wildfire

1005
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:37,040
risks, modeling human migration under

1006
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,839
sea level rise, and uh some of the work

1007
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,280
I'm going to uh share with you today, uh

1008
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,800
disaster mitigation planning for

1009
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,839
infrastructure resilience. So, we've

1010
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,040
looked at road uh fortification against

1011
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,280
flooding as well as um water

1012
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,839
infrastructure uh uh fortification

1013
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,000
against earthquakes. So in particular

1014
00:41:53,839 --> 00:42:01,119
critical infrastructure systems as you

1015
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,119
know are very vulnerable to natural

1016
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:08,680
disasters.

1017
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,680
Um unclear what is happening.

1018
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,440
No just decided to go to sleep for 30

1019
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,280
seconds.

1020
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:22,240
Um and um they uh they obviously have uh

1021
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,280
service disruptions which uh which

1022
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,920
impact disaster response. Uh they have

1023
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,480
uh uh impact on uh long-term and

1024
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,400
medium-term recovery as well as uh

1025
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,119
economic impacts in terms of cost of

1026
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,240
repairs and loss of productivity. And

1027
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,880
you know uh disaster response um is

1028
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,800
obviously very important but ideally we

1029
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,880
want to take actions before disaster

1030
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,520
strikes like what can we do ahead of

1031
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,480
time in order to minimize the possible

1032
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,359
impact uh when inevitably there's like a

1033
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,520
hurricane or an earthquake etc. So I am

1034
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,000
really a a very strong kind of

1035
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,359
passionate proponent on proactive

1036
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,800
investments in in in uh uh resilience

1037
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:09,040
efforts such as uh disaster mitigation.

1038
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,359
And so um I actually um purposefully

1039
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,520
tried to connect to Los Angeles uh

1040
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:15,680
agencies in order to understand what can

1041
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:19,920
I do to help them make LA more

1042
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:23,200
resilient. And um Los Angeles was uh

1043
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,599
actually at the forefront um well some

1044
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,800
six seven years ago where they actually

1045
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:31,040
have like a very sophisticated ambitious

1046
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,880
resilient plans. It was one of the 100

1047
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,480
resilient cities initiative if you

1048
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,400
remember. Um and so they actually put a

1049
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,280
lot of thought into what can be done and

1050
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,280
one of the goals uh that was identified

1051
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,079
since Los Angeles is exposed to many

1052
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,280
earthquakes uh is to really try to think

1053
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,240
about how can we fortify our water

1054
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,240
network in order to um minimize uh

1055
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,440
negative impacts in the event of a

1056
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:59,520
disaster. So they committed to this um

1057
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,160
kind of initiative called seismic

1058
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:05,200
seismic resilient pipe network where LA

1059
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,599
was going to uh fortify part of the

1060
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,839
water infrastructure with like special

1061
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,839
pipes that are less likely to break

1062
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,839
during the earthquake in order to make

1063
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,119
sure that critical customers like

1064
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:19,359
hospitals and evacuation centers and uh

1065
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,880
you know fire stations actually have

1066
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:25,599
water uh after uh or during the disaster

1067
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,000
in order to facilitate response.

1068
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,880
But okay, this plan was there. Now how

1069
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,800
do you actually do it? And so one of

1070
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,640
their chief engineers uh back in 2017 17

1071
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,960
who was kind of the mastermind behind

1072
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,560
this uh resilience goal really

1073
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,280
identified the fact that the proper

1074
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,680
layout of this investment fortification

1075
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,079
has to allow the network to be resilient

1076
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,960
in a cost-effective way. But but

1077
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,960
actually um this is like a very complex

1078
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,200
specially explicit network design

1079
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,079
problem that they didn't have the right

1080
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,480
tools to do. So the two of us connected

1081
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,079
in around 2018. We're like I was like

1082
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,760
well this is the kind of stuff I know

1083
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,480
how to do combinatory optimization

1084
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,520
network design. The their plan was to

1085
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,839
basically put engineers uh to be

1086
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,040
responsible for 2x two mile pieces of

1087
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,760
the city. Each engineer looks at the 2

1088
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,599
by two mile piece, decides what to be

1089
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,800
upgraded and then moves on to the other

1090
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,640
one and then they stitch it all

1091
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,400
together. Now when you're thinking about

1092
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,160
resilience, making localized decision on

1093
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,319
2x two mile and then stitching them all

1094
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,400
together is doomed not to be resilient.

1095
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,319
But they don't didn't have the

1096
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,960
computational tools to be thinking about

1097
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,960
anything larger scale than 2x2 miles. So

1098
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,440
we basically work closely with them to

1099
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,000
understand what are the uh constraints,

1100
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,599
what are the objective. and how to model

1101
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,400
this problem mathematically in a way

1102
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,480
that can scale up. And LA is

1103
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,960
particularly difficult because it's like

1104
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,400
I think the

1105
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:59,119
largest single service area across um

1106
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,079
across the country. It's like 473 square

1107
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:05,359
miles, 4 million resident with a high

1108
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:07,200
hazard percentage like 30% of customers

1109
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,599
and pipes are actually exposed to

1110
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,079
earthquake risk. So you have a large

1111
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,160
portion of the of the network that

1112
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,440
potentially you can choose to upgrade.

1113
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,200
So these are still like many many pipes

1114
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,040
but you have only limited budget to do

1115
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,440
them. So here is the formalization of

1116
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,079
the the network uh fortification problem

1117
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,079
that we were able to to formalize. So

1118
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,079
what you're uh uh you what you need to

1119
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,000
do is given a water network and seismic

1120
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,560
risk maps that basically identify some

1121
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,640
of the pipes that could be exposed to

1122
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,680
earthquake breakage. You want to select

1123
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,839
a subset of these pipes such that all

1124
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,119
critical customers which are nodes in

1125
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:50,480
this network must be directly connected

1126
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,480
to this fortified network consisting of

1127
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:56,560
either upgraded pipes or pipes that at

1128
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:59,119
zero risk of uh of uh breakage while at

1129
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:02,000
the same time providing overall coverage

1130
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:04,319
such that every resident so every parcel

1131
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,200
within the city is within one mile of

1132
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,440
that backbone fortified network. one

1133
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,520
wild mile. This is basically they want

1134
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,240
to make sure that in event of a of an

1135
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,640
earthquake uh a fire hose can be

1136
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,359
connected to a functioning water

1137
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,359
provision and and reach like a a

1138
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:24,560
building that might be on fire due to

1139
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:28,480
the earthquake effects. Right? So we

1140
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:33,200
have this kind of a um a complex problem

1141
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:35,040
very large network with both uh this uh

1142
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,440
critical customer constraints as well as

1143
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,280
the coverage

1144
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:42,560
constraint. So the data basically we had

1145
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,640
a a a non-disclosure agreement with LWP.

1146
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,119
They actually gave us the real water

1147
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,839
infrastructure network their critical

1148
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:53,520
customers. We got GS information from

1149
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:57,599
USGS on the earthquake hazards and um we

1150
00:47:53,520 --> 00:48:00,240
basically created this uh um this this

1151
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,839
optimization problem. So what does the

1152
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,520
optimization problem look like? We

1153
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,520
basically have this network in which

1154
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,960
edges are the pipes. The nodes are

1155
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,599
basically the connections between the

1156
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,319
the different pipes and we have the cost

1157
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:16,000
of choosing any edge or every any pipe

1158
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:17,920
to be upgraded. And that cost depends on

1159
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,839
uh how long the pipe is, what's the

1160
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,440
diameter like how much material it has

1161
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:24,400
and other things like how difficult it

1162
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,559
is to dig it out, how old it is etc. So

1163
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,440
they had a way of determining this cost.

1164
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,839
Sorry, we have uh a set of nodes that

1165
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,440
are the water sources. Uh the set of

1166
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,200
critical customers that we want to make

1167
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,119
sure that we reach and then this

1168
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,319
coverage constraints which basically for

1169
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:42,400
every residential area say okay at least

1170
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,240
one of the pipes within one mile radius

1171
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,680
better be part of that fortified

1172
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,520
network. Um and we are hoping to find

1173
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,040
basically the minimum cost solution that

1174
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,839
satisfies all of these resilience

1175
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,920
constraints. Um and so this becomes this

1176
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:58,319
complex Steiner network problem with

1177
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,880
coverage constraints. So Steiner network

1178
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:02,480
problems are are wellstudied but here we

1179
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,800
have this additional coverage constraint

1180
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,680
which makes the problem even harder. So

1181
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,680
we had to obviously uh try to figure out

1182
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,079
how to model it and and how to solve

1183
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,559
these problems. I'm going to skip in the

1184
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,000
interests of time but part of this is in

1185
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,920
order to get to something that is

1186
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,920
actually you can put it in an

1187
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,359
optimization solver. We also had to

1188
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,440
think about how to contract uh the the

1189
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:27,599
network representation. For example,

1190
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:30,079
large portions of the network are not at

1191
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,800
risk. So they become like a hyper node

1192
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,800
that then gets shrunk. And so all of

1193
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,680
pre-processing techniques in order to to

1194
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,760
make the optimization models um uh

1195
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:44,000
solvable well solvable still in a matter

1196
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,319
of many many hours. Um so um we

1197
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,319
developed this uh this model and and the

1198
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:50,720
techniques to solve it and we were able

1199
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:53,480
to provide solutions to them which were

1200
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:57,440
uh according to our estimate

1201
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:59,200
estimation between six to 23% uh most

1202
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,400
cost effective than like something that

1203
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,640
would look like more like the stitching

1204
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,280
that they were planning to do. And you

1205
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,599
know with some

1206
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:09,280
smart backend uh pre-processing and

1207
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:13,440
post-processing optimization we were

1208
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,839
able to to make this um scalable enough

1209
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,760
for us to be able to uh to address this

1210
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,280
problem. Yet these problems are really

1211
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,280
really hard to solve. I don't want to

1212
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,240
underestimate this especially as you

1213
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,240
want to increase the uh the uh the size.

1214
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,000
So in the beginning we were like okay we

1215
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,720
can promise you that you can do at most

1216
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,520
like a service zone. So there's like um

1217
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,520
I think about like 300 service zones

1218
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,520
across the LA. So it's divided into sub

1219
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,760
areas. Then we're like you know what we

1220
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,079
actually can do it f uh better. We can

1221
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,520
do like a district size. And then by the

1222
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,079
end we were actually able to solve

1223
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,559
really large portions of at once which

1224
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,720
means the bigger the spatial extent that

1225
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,160
you plan for the more cost effective

1226
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,839
solution you find. Right. So because

1227
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,319
you're actually seeing the the bigger

1228
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:59,200
context of the decisions. Yes. So this

1229
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:01,839
formulation doesn't allow for what we

1230
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,319
call these non network solutions. In

1231
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:07,760
other words, to have a lot of physically

1232
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,359
small resources and locations, you know,

1233
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,280
small uh

1234
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:15,680
households or you know neighborhoods and

1235
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:20,079
so forth. It just sort of brute force is

1236
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:22,240
the solution of the green of it all. So

1237
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,839
um I'm not sure I understand. Can you

1238
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,920
repeat the question? You know there is a

1239
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:27,760
lot of internet of things. You know you

1240
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,359
can put a little water well in your

1241
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,440
neighborhood rather than build a big Oh

1242
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:36,640
yeah. Yeah. Like in a sense this is I

1243
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,119
think this is not a traditional way of

1244
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,760
optimizing degree in the centralized

1245
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,839
way. Yes. Yeah. So this doesn't take

1246
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,119
into account other interventions. So

1247
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:47,440
here the only intervention we are

1248
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:50,160
modeling is that we are fortifying the

1249
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,480
existing uh water like centralized

1250
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:54,240
lifeline infrastructure. There could be

1251
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,720
an alternative or additional

1252
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,839
intervention which could be like I put

1253
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,520
local water sources that will provide

1254
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,920
power in power infrastructure in

1255
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:06,800
particular that's a huge area for us you

1256
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,839
know that we can we can do a lot of

1257
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:11,839
distributed energy resources solar and

1258
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:14,319
this and that rather than just build a

1259
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:16,720
network I think it's a huge question

1260
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:20,160
about the tradeoffs

1261
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:22,079
in water in water what is the tradeoffs

1262
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,079
but I we I haven't looked at it but this

1263
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:27,359
is very insightful comment because

1264
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:30,559
obviously some there would be like some

1265
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:32,720
uh parallel parallel interventions and

1266
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,599
infrastructure choices that one can make

1267
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,520
that are not just upgrading that hasn't

1268
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,040
been considered. I guess we were mostly

1269
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,520
following their lead in terms of what

1270
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:43,040
they were thinking and and and and and

1271
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,040
you know helping them solve the problem

1272
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,119
that they had identified but even just

1273
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:49,280
from like a water infrastructure like

1274
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,720
civil engineering perspective they could

1275
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,599
think of additional things that they

1276
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,599
want to model explicitly um yeah

1277
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,520
especially thinking that you you know

1278
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,520
from an optimization perspective once

1279
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:02,800
you have the basic model actually adding

1280
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:05,200
these extra choices it's not that hard

1281
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,520
that's the beauty of like you know using

1282
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,280
something like mint integer programming

1283
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,240
models where like adding side

1284
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,240
constraints is not you know it's pretty

1285
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,119
easy as opposed to like a custom

1286
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:20,240
solution but it's more like gaming it's

1287
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:22,240
more than just centraliz

1288
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,240
you know so it's a very different

1289
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:28,720
problem and I think you made a comment

1290
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:31,520
that if you do bottom up you're going to

1291
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:34,240
be losing that is with new technologies

1292
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:35,920
I'm not convinced that that's really the

1293
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,839
answer

1294
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,680
Well, I think this is a different

1295
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,160
aspect. I think you can have local

1296
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,079
interventions like for example putting

1297
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,000
uh

1298
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:47,520
community you know systems or something

1299
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,200
like that. You could still plan for

1300
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:54,559
those things at a at a at a global level

1301
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:57,599
like as you know as the LWP as it says

1302
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,160
as the caretaker of this can still plan

1303
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,720
the allocation of those community

1304
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:03,760
resources not

1305
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,240
necessarily otherwise you would have to

1306
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,839
like simulate individual commu like

1307
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:11,839
neighborhood choices to do that or not.

1308
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:14,960
Yeah that's more like an emergent

1309
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:17,599
emergent resilience. I agree.

1310
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:19,680
Um and obviously like you can uh go

1311
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,079
beyond just the optimum solution. You

1312
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,480
can be thinking about additional metrics

1313
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,720
in terms of like uh you know who is

1314
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,559
affected and how much if you cannot

1315
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,359
you're not able to cover all of the

1316
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:33,040
critical customers and just counting for

1317
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,319
example like some resilience metric

1318
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,640
without looking at the spatial

1319
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:38,240
distribution of benefits uh might be

1320
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,920
problematic as well. So there's like

1321
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,079
additional variance that one can think

1322
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,680
of. I saw another question was just

1323
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,680
actually related to this. I was going to

1324
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,319
ask if there was a prediction step to

1325
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,800
this or if the risk types or portions of

1326
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:52,640
the network were deterministic and like

1327
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,640
in in this analysis there were like

1328
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,640
basically we're using the USGS hazard

1329
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,480
layers but obviously one can think about

1330
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,520
like okay this hazard layers are some

1331
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,040
kind of aggregate of a portfolio of

1332
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:05,760
possible you know earthquake scenarios

1333
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,599
you could explicitly think about in like

1334
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,359
a portfolio of scenarios opposed to one

1335
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,680
aggregate layer or you could even think

1336
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:14,000
about like predictions and so on. Um,

1337
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,599
and these are all like fair game for

1338
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,119
more sophisticated, more detailed

1339
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:21,920
analysis of this decision-m. I

1340
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:23,839
agree. Um, and so this I guess through

1341
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,839
this foray of applications, I'm giving

1342
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:27,440
you several examples that I hope have

1343
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:30,160
illustrated how both machine learning

1344
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,920
and operations research uh approaches

1345
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,800
have an immense role to play in

1346
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,880
addressing some uh of this pressing

1347
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,760
societal problems. And there's a large

1348
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,000
scope of of uh uh of things to do

1349
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,800
especially when you work closely with

1350
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,040
with um you know NOS's and local

1351
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,280
agencies to understand the problems and

1352
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:52,559
and uh and objectives and constraints

1353
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,880
they need to face and identify like fit

1354
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:57,680
for purpose solutions. I'm a very big

1355
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:01,440
believer about like really grounding uh

1356
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:03,760
this um uh applications in in real

1357
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,960
partnerships. It's a two-way street. we

1358
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,119
can provide uh useful models and and

1359
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,040
algorithms and solutions to them. But

1360
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:13,280
often they identify really important

1361
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,720
challenges to our field, the algorithmic

1362
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:19,280
field that push us to try to innovate

1363
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,520
and and and then therefore enriches our

1364
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,440
own discipline. And I don't know, it

1365
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,200
seems like I'm not going to have time,

1366
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,960
but I was going to tell you like on the

1367
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,000
method side what this has meant for me

1368
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,440
is like basically a lot of these

1369
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,960
optimization problems that arise in

1370
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,640
solving infrastructure resilience

1371
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,760
problems so on are really hard to solve.

1372
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:40,559
their large case scale and current

1373
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,960
solvers for these mathematical problems

1374
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:46,160
really do not cannot scale and solve

1375
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,880
them. So then this pushed this um agenda

1376
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:52,160
about how can we scale up uh discrete

1377
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,559
optimization solvers to uh this more

1378
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,880
realistic real world problems which made

1379
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:59,200
me work on the integration of machine

1380
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,599
learning and optimization from a methods

1381
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:04,240
perspective. speeding up algorithms for

1382
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,720
solving uh mixed integer optimization

1383
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:09,520
problems by using machine learning

1384
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,799
inside the algorithmic uh approaches

1385
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,079
themselves where we're learning

1386
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:17,440
automatically from the behavior of the

1387
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:19,920
solver new huristics and algorithmic

1388
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,160
design principles that then uh allow us

1389
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:24,720
to solve this uh problems faster or find

1390
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,839
better solution in quicker time. So, so

1391
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:30,000
I have this whole other talk that I can

1392
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:31,520
talk about how we combine. So, I've show

1393
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,280
you examples of individual machine

1394
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:35,440
learning and optimization for this

1395
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,559
applicationdriven research. But when we

1396
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,520
combine machine learning and

1397
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:41,839
optimization to actually uh solve uh

1398
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,559
these real world problems, it's a really

1399
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:48,799
really exciting methodological area that

1400
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:51,200
um uh I um I'm very passionate about.

1401
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,799
And so if you're curious, ask me after

1402
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,760
the talk because I'm not gonna have time

1403
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:58,760
to to talk about it. But thank you so

1404
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,760
much.
