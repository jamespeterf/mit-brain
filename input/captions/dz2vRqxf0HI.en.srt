1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,560
It turns out that much of what accounts

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,599
for success in life is not skill or hard

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,160
work but luck.

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,000
And in that case,

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,599
it's not true that rich people are rich

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,800
because they deserve it or because they

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,600
have skills or worked hard or they're

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,160
just lucky. And why do we necessarily

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,880
want to reward luck? Indeed, can't we

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,800
think of redistribution as kind of luck

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,279
insurance?

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
Imagine a world where a random event's

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,399
going to happen to you. You get hit by a

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,399
car. We talked about why we want

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,600
insurance, right? Want insurance to make

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,960
sure if we get hit by the car, don't get

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,280
hit by the car, we're in the same off.

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,440
Well, same thing. Rolls talked about

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
behind the veil of ignorance. Imagine

20
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,920
before you're born, you don't know if

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,680
you were rich or poor. You would choose

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,520
a system which would ensure you against

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,879
being poor.

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,960
And that system which would involve

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,680
transfers.

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,199
So if much of success is due to luck,

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,239
we're going to want a system that shoots

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,840
the rich to the poor because the rich

29
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,199
got lucky, the poor didn't. That's

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,040
uncertainty we want to ensure against.

31
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,560
Okay. Fascinating fact. If you if you

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,320
interview people around the world and

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,280
ask them

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,960
is success mostly due to hard work or to

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,680
luck. In the US people say hard work. In

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,200
Europe people say luck. In Europe they

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,880
have much higher redistribution than we

38
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
do in the US.

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,840
because they have a view that much more

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,840
success comes from luck.
