1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,680
so let's now turn to our panel of alums

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:10,400
so um maybe we can start by asking each

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,880
of you to introduce yourself um and

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,400
we'll do that uh maybe by asking you

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,000
what you did prior to joining MIT where

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,119
you went to school maybe what you

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,760
studied um if you did have full-time

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,279
work experience you can mention what

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,760
that is and then you could tell us a

10
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,560
little bit more about what you're doing

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,519
now um so we can just use this slide to

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,040
kind of go down the line so um ana would

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,120
you like to start great so hi everyone

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,360
I'm Anka um also like my full name is

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,239
anesti um I'm half French half Spanish I

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,039
studied mechanical engineering at

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,719
Imperial College London uh I didn't have

18
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,000
full-time experience but I did have some

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,879
internships so I worked at Tesla

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,480
Bloomberg Amazon um and then decided to

21
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:56,039
join the MIT mband program so I

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,039
graduated last year um I'm now an alumni

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,239
and I'm working as a machine learning

24
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,760
scientist at a startup in New York

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,520
that's called AR in Ai and they just do

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,360
like AI solutions for companies

27
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:12,200
essentially excellent

28
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,920

everyone I'm Emily um like Ana I just

30
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,000
graduated from the mban program in

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,200
August um but before the mban I did my

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,880
undergraduate at um Cornell University

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,759
um I'm also from New York so this is my

34
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,119
first time living outside of New York um

35
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,000
before that I did not have any work work

36
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,960
experience but I did do an internship at

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,320
regeneron and now I am I I am a data

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,200
scientist at Dynamic ideas which is like

39
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,640
a um I guess you'd call it like a

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,880

down south right next to Hong Kong so

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,399
prior to MIT um I work as a data

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,079
scientist at a Tech startup in Boston

48
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:06,640
area for one year focusing on real East

49
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,399
machine learning applications and before

50
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,840
that I did my undergrad at Bentley

51
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,080
University U with a double major in data

52
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,519
and math really nice to meet you all all

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,160
right thanks and

54
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,040
Britney um Thanks Jen hi everyone I'm

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Britney I'm part of the mban class of

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,000
2023 um and before coming into the mban

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,760
I similarly came straight from undergrad

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,200
so I was doing my uh major in statistics

59
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,239
and minor in data science at the

60
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,800
University of Virginia and then since

61
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,360
graduating from the mban I'm in the

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,640
Washington DC area uh working as a data

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,920
scientist for

64
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,800
Visa all right well thank you for those

65
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,879
um introductions and sharing a bit more

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,440
about your background um to start let's

67
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,519
let's talk a little bit about the

68
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,680
community within um the business

69
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,720
analytics program and you know the

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,920
greater MIT Sloan community so you know

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,879
I recognize that you know as a as a

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,360
prospective applicant it can be quite

73
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,519
quite intimidating to think about

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,440
joining MIT the class profile you know

75
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,840
is very impressive you know you hear

76
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,680
these stories and see you know um

77
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,319
exposure of MIT in the media and it can

78
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,440
be you know um you know intimidating

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,680
especially as a woman to think about you

80
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,840
know um you know becoming a part of this

81
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,640
community that's um you know very

82
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,200
technical and very quantitative in

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,360
nature and you know sometimes not not

84
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,799
necessarily true but sometimes can be

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,439
stereotyped as you know this sort of

86
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,480
cold Cutthroat kind of place um so my

87
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:36,480
first question is can you talk about you

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,200
know your experience or how you were

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,680
able to um uh you know get yourself

90
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:47,400
involved in the community or the culture

91
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,400
at MIT Sloan and anybody can take

92
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,280
it I guess that could kick off so since

93
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,840
uh I have you know uh more current

94
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,000
experiences and I guess all of my fellow

95
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,599
and bance could jump in later um I know

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,439
that Jen mentioned that there there will

97
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,319
be a certain level of technical

98
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,480
rigorousness to the program but um I

99
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,159
would say don't shy away from the

100
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,959
technical nature and the challenges that

101
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:21,079
will be facing you um there's a very

102
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,759
strong community at M and also in the

103
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,720
bigger part of like outside of mben

104
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,759
could support you along the way so

105
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,240
definitely take advantage of you know

106
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,880
all kind of opportunities ask question

107
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,560
and seek out support to grow grow with

108
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,400
each other like within my um current

109
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,680
cohort there are people with a lot of

110
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,120
different mixture of background some

111
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,960
people are more you know their love and

112
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,960
good at theoretical math and some other

113
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,320
are programming Geniuses so definitely

114
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,440
lean on each other learn with each other

115
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,479
and benefit from each other's skill set

116
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,000
and grow with each

117
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,400
other I I think part of what we're

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,080
trying to um emphasize with students and

119
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,680
the way that you know the work is

120
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,880
introduced or expected to be completed

121
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,960
is that we bring people together with a

122
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,960
diverse set of skills and with

123
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,400
complimentary skills um and you know

124
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,520
together you know you have the tools to

125
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,560
succeed where you know if you were just

126
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,360
stick you know alone as an individual it

127
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,440
might be more difficult to develop all

128
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,919
those skills so maybe we could talk a

129
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,560
little bit about you know working with a

130
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,440
team of people on some aspect of the

131
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,880
program um where you had to work

132
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,600
alongside people who you felt were

133
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,600
really different from

134
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,400
yourself again anybody can I can speak

135
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,000
of it I know that um a lot of people

136
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,160
like you said then like they have so

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,400
many diverse experiences they come from

138
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,880
very different backgrounds whether

139
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,280
that's like their undergrad degree or

140
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,840
whether that's the country that they

141
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,360
were raised and like educated um in and

142
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,479
I feel like that really shows when we're

143
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,360
working working on group projects where

144
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,680
um you can see that some people are much

145
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,520
better at like brainstorming ideas and

146
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,960
like coming up with new Solutions other

147
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,240
are much better at like just being like

148
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,440
product driven and like implementing and

149
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,599
and driving driving like action and

150
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,440
others are more about like making sure

151
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,319
that everything's like quality-wise in a

152
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,639
good good State and I feel like all of

153
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,479
those contributions from different

154
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,080
people and different mindsets really

155
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,680
helps to like Drive even when we were

156
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,000
doing projects like drive a project

157
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,160
forward and really like make it

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,800
successful I would say like this program

159
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,919
isn't made for you to just come on your

160
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,360
own and like do it all on your own and

161
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,319
succeed on your own it's really about

162
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,440
like finding what are your strengths

163
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,599
what are your weaknesses how can you um

164
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,080
find people that complement those and

165
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:49,639
work together to achieving like really

166
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,319
good outcomes in work homeworks

167
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:58,240
whatever sounds great um could you talk

168
00:06:53,319 --> 00:07:00,400
about you know an example of a memorable

169
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,840
you know course that you took or a

170
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,280
memorable story about one of the faculty

171
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,080
members that you know were um either

172
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,280
teaching or supporting one of the

173
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,280
initiatives you were involved

174
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,919
in um I'm just wanted to build on

175
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,120
something that like totally agree with

176
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,720
everything Angel and um ana have said so

177
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,680
far um I think that one of the best

178
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,479
examples of this is the aab and the

179
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,000
Capstone experiences of the mband that's

180
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,599
one of the reasons that the program is

181
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,960
so wonderful is that we actually get

182
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:35,759
real life opportunity to provide value

183
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,120
to organizations through analytics um so

184
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,319
in the fall students will have the

185
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,360
opportunity to team up in pairs or

186
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,759
groups of like three to four students

187
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,960
and they're partnered with a uh host uh

188
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,360
aab company so throughout the duration

189
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,319
of the semester they'll be doing a

190
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,560
project for that company um for me it

191
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,159
was working with Visa definitely um

192
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,840
helped me get to my current position um

193
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:57,800
and then of course there's the Capstone

194
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,120
experience where you have your uh

195
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,840
partner and you and your part are doing

196
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,400
a essentially like a summer internship

197
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,280
for a company that you're also partnered

198
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,319
with and so in both of those situations

199
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,080
you're working with you know ideally two

200
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,840
different companies you're working with

201
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,199
a small group of students in your cohort

202
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,879
um like you know Ana and Angel have said

203
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,199
you're working with students from many

204
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,039
different countries that's one of the

205
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,639
things that Drew me to mban is just the

206
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:23,360
pure diversity of background of the

207
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,560
cohort getting to talk to people who

208
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,039
have had different background

209
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,720
experiences and life experiences was a

210
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,960
lot of fun and really makes the

211
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,760
experience very Rich um but I think

212
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,519
those two project experiences basically

213
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,120
help us to translate whatever we've been

214
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,640
learning in the classroom um at slan

215
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:44,839
into you know real projects and I think

216
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,480
those really help uh to stand

217
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,720
out

218
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,959
excellent all right um you know maybe we

219
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,640
could talk a little bit about you know

220
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:56,000
some of the activities you may have

221
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,640
gotten involved with um as a student at

222
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,160
MIT Sloan so you know actually I have

223
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,800
another slide here here that talks a

224
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,360
little bit about um you know some of the

225
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,279
clubs that are focused on women's

226
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,920
initiatives at MIT I don't know if any

227
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,760
of you were involved in any of these

228
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,839

you get after MIT but for ENT your

287
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,399
entire career and how to think about

288
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,920
kind of networking and emailing and you

to Industry through some of these

296
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,320
student run organization so um my first

297
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,880
question is can you talk a little bit

298
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,240
about how you may have worked um with

299
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,279

help support you in your career

301
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:18,680
search I can start um so like you said

302
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,399
we have like an amazing team of like

303
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,360
helping us with careers especially Tracy

304
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,240
um I remember that in fall semester they

305
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,320
really prepare you to just like get

306
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,399
ready for like career like applications

307
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,160
and stuff and in in spring semester um

308
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,000
and so that will cover everything from

309
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,600
like making sure that your resume is

310
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,120
like on point and like you're LinkedIn

311
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,079
and all of those like tiny things of

312
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,680
like how do you interact with someone

313
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,560
new like how do you present yourself

314
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,279
which can be can sound like very easy

315
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,760
things but when you actually get to the

316
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,800
moment um knowing having those skill

317
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,399
sets and like those tips and tricks

318
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,040
really help and make a difference um I

319
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,720
would say one of the biggest like like

320
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,680
one of the most helpful helpful things

321
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,399
for me um at MIT was the number of

322
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,480
networking nights that we had I think

323
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,519
I've never networked as much as

324
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,399
throughout MIT year which was really

325
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,000
useful in like getting to know people

326
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:13,519
getting to even if it's not like to

327
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,839
recruit like to work for them and their

328
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,440
company it's just getting to know what

329
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,800
they do and figuring out is that what I

330
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,199
want to do in the future and like is

331
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,880
that the path that I want to take is

332
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:23,399
that the industry that I want to work it

333
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,320
is this the the job that fits my needs

334
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,839
and skill sets um and so having that

335
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,320
opportunity to network with people

336
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,279
through like I don't know we had had

337
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,320
analytics nights we had Capstone um

338
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:37,199
events with companies just bringing so

339
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,120
many people together and giving this

340
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:42,519
that opportunity to talk and meet new

341
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,519
people was was really

342
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,120
amazing excellent anyone else want to

343
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,279
touch on any of the things they might

344
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,199
have gotten involved with or worked with

345
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,920
Tracy

346
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:55,560
on yeah Tracy is just the best like

347
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,560
cannot emphasize enough um she's given

348
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,160
us so much good advice like Ana said

349
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,079
about you know anything from you know

350
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,279
etiquette at career fears when talking

351
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:05,240
to recruiters to little tips and tricks

352
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,720
for your LinkedIn as we approach you

353
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,560
know more of the job search in the

354
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,600
spring so she's been super valuable um

355
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,040
throughout the program um in addition to

356
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,920
that I also wanted to add that MIT and

357
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,440
Sloan specifically have a very

358
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,399
supportive Network um especially with

359
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,079
alumni and so for example they've always

360
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,360
had these events such as slone's helping

361
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,519
slones or Sloan wide Career Fairs where

362
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,279
not only can you um interact with other

363
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:33,320
M bands but more or less you're talking

364
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:36,079
to salones from the MBA or the mfin so

365
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,680
other programs as well and um all

366
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,600
there's just this really supportive

367
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,639
culture at Sloan and that's something

368
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,720
that's really nice about it um in

369
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:48,079
addition to that any sloy or mban is

370
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,600
likely to you know be you know on a whim

371
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,480
able to do an informational interview

372
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,480
with you so if you're looking for jobs

373
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,600
or just exploring different Industries

374
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,880
in the spring or earlier uh most alumni

375
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,079
will just pick up the phone or hop on a

376
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,240
quick quick call with you so the culture

377
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,920
that we try to Foster at Sloan is really

378
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,600
wonderful and supportive and so

379
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,360
definitely take advantage of all of the

380
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,040
career opportunities at uh mban through

381
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,000
Tracy and that support but also the

382
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,720
wider Sloan Community can also be super

383
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,320
valuable awesome all right well now that

384
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,240
three out of the four of you have kind

385
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,000
of launched into your career can you

386
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,560
talk a little bit about you know

387
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,920
something that you learned during the

388
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,800
course of the program that you know have

389
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,759
has been able to help you to succeed in

390
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,759
the work that you're doing

391
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:39,240
today I guess I can start um so yeah I

392
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,000
work at Dynamic ideas which is one of

393
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,680
Professor brutus's companies um for

394
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,720
those of you that know don't know

395
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,199
Professor bruus kind of helped to found

396
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,160
this program so he has a big part in um

397
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:53,160
all things and ban um but something that

398
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,040
I find interesting with my day-to-day

399
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,279
like tasks is that I'm really getting to

400
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,319
apply all the technical skills that I've

401
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,680
learned throughout the year so all the

402
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:03,639
machine learning and optimization um

403
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,279
kind of getting to do both which is um

404
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,920
really cool but on top of that I'm also

405
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,519
um interacting with clients and stuff so

406
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,759
that kind of goes back to what everyone

407
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,000
was talking about with Tracy and the

408
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,120
networking events just getting

409
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,240
comfortable talking to people who might

410
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,000
be higher up or people from different

411
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,560
backgrounds and industries um so just

412
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,399
getting to apply both like the technical

413
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,880
and the soft skills in my job every day

414
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:29,279
has been really

415
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:33,000
rewarding great anyone else

416
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,800
I can go so in my case I didn't really

417
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,399
have any like business analytics data

418
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,399
science background at all I had come

419
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,279
from a purely engineering background um

420
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,040
and honestly this was the opportunity to

421
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,759
just discover a whole new world that I

422
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,600
hadn't been introduced to previously the

423
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,399
whole like business analytics data

424
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,199
science AI world and without this

425
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,480
program I would never have been able to

426
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,399
like get a job that get the job that I'm

427
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,560
in right now just because I didn't have

428
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,959
any of the skill sets required so for me

429
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,800
this program is really useful in just

430
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:02,959
getting getting getting you up to speed

431
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,160
with everything that's happening right

432
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:08,640
now especially now that like AI is just

433
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,120
like really really evolving super

434
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,160
quickly and it's hard to like keep up to

435
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,679
date with everything I think it's like

436
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,520
the perfect time to join join a pro pro

437
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,319
program like this um and it was super

438
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,120
valuable for me to be able to like just

439
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,679
even access the

440
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,880
industry

441
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,760
excellent all right so um you know

442
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,280
before we turn over to the audience Q&A

443
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,400
and I'll um ask you know if everybody

444
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,360
could type in their questions in the Q&A

445
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,559
and then we can um you know I can

446
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,200
moderate those questions live you know

447
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,280
the one last question I'd like to ask

448
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,240
each of our panelists is you know

449
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,880
sometimes at these events um of course

450
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,640
telling us a bit about your background

451
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,720
is important and it's um great to share

452
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,360
you know your background with with the

453
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,799
audience and perspective students but

454
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,000
there's never we're never able to

455
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,760
provide enough um you know enough to to

456
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,320
prospective applic about what do the

457
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,320
current students in the class look like

458
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,360
what are some of their backstories so

459
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,000
you know without naming names I'm hoping

460
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,600
that you know each of you could just

461
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,640
share um a story or a bit about a

462
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,840
background of another female student

463
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,840
that was in your class so you know you

464
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,440
could just share you know what was it

465
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,400
about this individual that kind of

466
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,039
impressed you and you know um any kind

467
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,600
of um you know background story where

468
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,840
they went to school where they worked

469
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,799
the country they're from you know any

470
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,880
anything that would be kind of relevant

471
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,880
to you know helping prospective

472
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,120
applicants to gain a better

473
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,880
understanding of who they might be

474
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,679
sitting next to in

475
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,760
class um and so you know um if if each

476
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,039
of you could just share like a tidbit

477
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,760
about you know one of your fellow um

478
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:52,039
slones so maybe Angel I'll start with

479
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,919
you yes a quite a lot of individual is

480
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:56,360
jumping to my mind it's very hard to

481
00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,440
pick one I would tell you that um I

482
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:03,159
would say um this person e is one of my

483
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,760
closest friend in the program currently

484
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,679
and um she's graduated from chingua

485
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,799
University which is the best university

486
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:14,000
in China studying physics and math com

487
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:17,720
before uh joining MIT I am particularly

488
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,080
impressed by her um background as in

489
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,120
quite a lot of us do not share you know

490
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,280
like data signs or pure machine learning

491
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,600
um knowledge before the program he h

492
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,600
into this uh field to this program

493
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,880
without that background but so be

494
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,159
thriving so I'm like particularly

495
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,240
impressed by that and also I knew her

496
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:43,799
from her prior story as in uh industry

497
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,960
industry experiences she work in quite a

498
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:50,360
lot of different domain domains from

499
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:54,400
social media company to like fashion Etc

500
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,480
and how she being a man like maneuvering

501
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,240
through different industry and trying to

502
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,159
shovel down into the places where she

503
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,360
eventually wanted to be that's

504
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:08,559
particularly inspiring for

505
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:11,080
myself exciting thanks Emily how about

506
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,640
you um yeah this is also a hard question

507
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,000
for me and I can't say Ana because she

508
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,240
just introduced herself but um I guess

509
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,799
someone for me like early on that I

510
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,039
thought was like I guess inspirational

511
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,080
is um our classmate Julia so she had two

512
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:27,840
years I believe of work experience

513
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,400
versus I came straight out of college I

514
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,200
had like pretty much work experience

515
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,640
other than like an internship here and

516
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,080
there um and she was probably like one

517
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,200
of the most outspoken people in our

518
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,120
class and she really inspired me to you

519
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,320
know ask questions and like stand up for

520
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,039
myself like even if you might feel

521
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,960
scared to like ask questions to like a

522
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,440
important speaker or like a professor um

523
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,520
and on top of that just working in

524
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,320
projects with her or working on

525
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,080
homeworks with her she was really good

526
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,840
at um kind of thinking from a business

527
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,280
perspective like what is the impact not

528
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,320
just like the nitty-gritty technical

529
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,960
details um and uh I guess for someone

530
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,840
like me coming straight out of undergrad

531
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,760
it's good to collaborate with people

532
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:08,320
with different work experiences maybe

533
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,840
people that are older than me um yeah

534
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,760
awesome all right and

535
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,400
Britney yeah um I think in my class one

536
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,840
of my classmates definitely had an

537
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,840
unconventional experience they actually

538
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,279
had gone to undergrad studying pre

539
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,720
health and then had gone through medical

540
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:26,200
school so they actually did have a

541
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,039
medical degree um and decided to

542
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,679
transition totally into the world of

543
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:32,559
tech and data science and so I think you

544
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:33,960
know that's just one example of you know

545
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,080
even if you have very diverse

546
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,480
backgrounds of what you're studying if

547
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,279
you are interested in data science and

548
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,480
you think you could really work hard and

549
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:44,840
you know come to Sloan and um commit

550
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,000
yourself to it anything's possible and

551
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,159
they did amazingly in the program and

552
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,320
now are working at a biotech in uh

553
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:53,400
Cambridge so I think it's just one

554
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,720
example and they really enjoy it and can

555
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,480
even use their previous bio knowledge to

556
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,279
improve analytics in that field uh so

557
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,640
yeah just another example awesome and

558
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,840
Ana how about

559
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,320
you so I was thinking of a girl who came

560
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,000
from like a more complicated complicated

561
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,720
background like more family issues or

562
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,240
like the country where she originally

563
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,720
was from was having some struggles um

564
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,919
and what impressed me the most is like

565
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,640
despite having that more like not

566
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:24,760
unfortunate background but you guys know

567
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,320
what I mean just like not as an easy

568
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,799
path as other people may have she like

569
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,120
fought for herself and just like

570
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:34,279
achieved like aimed to achieve the

571
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,159
biggest thing like you could try to get

572
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:38,880
which is like an in uh an incredible

573
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,880
University in the US um like this one

574
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,159
like which is a really well-known uh

575
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,400
program and just getting getting getting

576
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,120
in like interviewing not being afraid to

577
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,880
like Aim High Reach High um and getting

578
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,640
through this whole year is just very

579
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,039
very impressive for me like what someone

580
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,720
can achieve um never be afraid and like

581
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:01,880
yeah awesome all right so now I'm going

582
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,720
to turn it over to the Q&A so I can see

583
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,559
a couple people are trying to use the

584
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,159
raise your hand function um we just to

585
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,480
keep things kind of streamlined we're

586
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,039
going to ask everybody type their

587
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,559
questions into into the Q&A and um and

588
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:15,559
then we'll do our best to get get to

589
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,240
everything so the first question is

590
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:20,880
about um does Sloan offer any type of

591
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,120
mentorship programs um through the

592
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,440
school and you know did anybody here get

593
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,640
involved in those and so did did anybody

594
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,120
here get involved in any of the

595
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,279
leadership coaching or mentorship

596
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:34,600
programs that

597
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,960
loan um there are a number of different

598
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,760
things you can get involved with from

599
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,159
the leadership Center through the career

600
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,760
development office and um as well as

601
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,919
swim which is the Sloan women in

602
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,840
management organization they have lots

603
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,679
of different kind of match making and

604
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,840
mentorship programs that you can opt

605
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,360
into um none of them are required but

606
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:55,279
there's lots of different um you know uh

607
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,559
opportunities to engage in mentorship

608
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,679
programs and then similarly you know as

609
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:03,440
an Alum with we will um be asking you to

610
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:06,120
kind of um you know volunteer to give

611
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,840
back to some of the current students um

612
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,720
the follow-up question to that was also

613
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,320
if there were any veterans here um and

614
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,799
their insights about using this program

615
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:18,600
to you know uh you know transition uh I

616
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:20,360
would assume to kind of uh a

617
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,720
professional experience I don't think we

618
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,520
have any veterans here but um you know

619
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,720
we certainly have had many veterans come

620
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,880
through our programs and use our

621
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,960
master's programs to kind of upskill and

622
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,840
you know create um more expertise in an

623
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,000
area that would allow them to transition

624
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,640
out of the military um okay so the next

625
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,399
question is do we consider students with

626
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,039
10 plus years of

627
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:44,440
experience um you know the simple answer

628
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:46,080
is this this program is really designed

629
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,720
for students who are pretty early on in

630
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,799
their career it's considered um you know

631
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,840
a master A specialized master's program

632
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,600
for people who have on average five

633
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,960
years or less of experience as I showed

634
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,279
before about um you know 80 % of the

635
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,960
students are actually coming directly

636
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:04,039
from undergrad in this program and then

637
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,480
the rest have usually you know two to

638
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:09,320
four years of full-time work experience

639
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,240
so um the the simple thing to think

640
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,640
about instead would be to do the

641
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,880
traditional MBA program with a focus on

642
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,360
business analytics we do have an A a

643
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,159
road map or kind of we call it a

644
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,480
certificate that you could focus on

645
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:23,200
within the MBA program or even possibly

646
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,919
an Executive MBA with a focus on

647
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,720
business analytics um all right so then

648
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,360
the next question is this is an

649
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,720
international student applying to MIT

650
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,760
and they're confused about applying

651
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,399
between the MBA and the master business

652
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,000
analytics program um and looking for a

653
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:40,760
little advice um what about you guys do

654
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,640
you guys have any advice to people

655
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:44,640
considering mban versus the 2-year

656
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,840
MBA um I'll say that from my experience

657
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,480
talking to students in the MBA program

658
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,640
they do have a few more years of work

659
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,760
experience and that's a lot of uh

660
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,440
they're bringing that back to the

661
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,840
classroom to share with their

662
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,039
perspectives with fellow students and

663
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,039
with professors and that's a big part of

664
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:05,799
the course content um whereas I think in

665
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:08,159
the mband as Jen said we're a lot

666
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:09,600
earlier on in our careers um and we're

667
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,360
coming here to learn the technical

668
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,679
foundation for what we can do later on

669
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,919
in our career um so that's a little bit

670
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,880
of a distinguishing Factor however I

671
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,919
will say that as part of the mbn program

672
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,240
we do get to take a lot of business

673
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:24,840
related electives in the spring so for

674
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,880
example many of the students in my

675
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:30,159
cohort really loved power and

676
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,399
negotiation or consumer Behavior digital

677
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,399
product management communicating with

678
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:36,720
data these are all classes that you can

679
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:38,559
choose to take in the spring if you want

680
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,320
and you get to interact with mbas you

681
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,440
get to learn from their experiences and

682
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,679
add to that classroom culture even as an

683
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,360
mband so um I would say if you're early

684
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:47,960
on in your career but still interested

685
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,640
in the business aspect mban is

686
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,120
definitely a good

687
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,960
option completely agree great answer all

688
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,200
right so the next question is focus on

689
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,720
Anka but I think um anyone here could

690
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,559
really comment on this is a pretty

691
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,600
common question we get about you know

692
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,240
coming from an engineering background

693
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,919
you know how did you best prepare for

694
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,120
the master of business analytics program

695
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:12,720
any classes or skills you might have

696
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:16,520
tried to develop prior to matriculating

697
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,080
um I don't know if you want I think um I

698
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,840
decided quite late late on in my degree

699
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,440
that I wanted to to do the mband program

700
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,679
so what I tried to do was in the final

701
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,559
year of my studies I I had the option to

702
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:30,679
take some electives and I tried to

703
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:33,039
tailor those a tiny bit more to what I'd

704
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:35,080
be studying at MIT so not exactly the

705
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:38,360
same but I tried to take some more like

706
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,919
statistical um courses numerical methods

707
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:45,200
um some more like introduction to

708
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:47,919
machine learning um even my like thesis

709
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,720
of end of end of year end of appro like

710
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,760
degree thesis uh was slightly um

711
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,919
tailored towards machine learning and

712
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,440
that gave me some like Head Start of

713
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,279
what I could expect from this program

714
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,840
and I think that was really useful um I

715
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,679
don't think I did much more apart from

716
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:06,600
that just like keep being curious and

717
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,399
like learn like wanting to learn about

718
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,960
new things maybe reading some papers

719
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,720
maybe reading um some textbooks I think

720
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,840
that's that's always useful for sure

721
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,519
great any other general advice about

722
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,519
preparation prior to joining the

723
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,720
program yeah go for it

724
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,000
Angel uh well after I got admitted and

725
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,039
then I reach out to some LOM Ana and

726
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,480
Emily and asking them for suggestion so

727
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:39,200
I'm going to quote whatever they told me

728
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,440
it said maybe some refresher on linear

729
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,720
algebra and also there are a lot of

730
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,200
great resources out there like Cera and

731
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,880
MIT open course where you can find

732
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,519
related content that can better uh

733
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,440
sharpen your technical skills like or

734
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:59,039
maybe even math like particular areas

735
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:02,320
that you found theode in yeah great

736
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,840
advice um all right so the next question

737
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,799
is um is this program suited for those

738
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,200
within interest within interests at the

739
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,279
intersection of data science and public

740
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,679
policy um and what are some of the

741
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,640
skills in this program that are

742
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,919
applicable to the public sector so um I

743
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,960
don't think anybody here is working in

744
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,480
um in something related to public policy

745
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,120
or at least not yet but we have

746
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,120
certainly seen over the years so this

747
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,240
program has um close to 10 years of

748
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,279
alumni at this point um we have

749
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,240
certainly seen people transition from a

750
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,320
more technical role to a more policy

751
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,640
Focus focused role later into their

752
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,039
career but you know typically you would

753
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,279
need to have that kind of solid

754
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,640
foundation of analytics or data science

755
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,600
first and then using that kind of

756
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,320
operational knowledge to then be able to

757
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,159
influence policy type of decisions and

758
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,720
um you know I know here at MIT there's a

759
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:54,600
lot of work uh being done uh with

760
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,039
generative Ai and policy as well as you

761
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,760
know things happening at the computer

762
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:59,720
science and artificial intelligence lab

763
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,080
it's called called Cale as well as the

764
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,960
schwarzman College of computing and a

765
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,320
lot of this work is very much in

766
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,720
partnership with government agencies and

767
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,760
you know policy that's um looking at

768
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,559
kind of the ethics of generative AI

769
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,480
among many other things how it's being

770
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:17,840
used in health care and other things um

771
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,120
so certainly there's exposure to this

772
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,200
type of thinking and um you know

773
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,519
opportunities to work potentially as a

774
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,720
research assistant in some of the space

775
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,640
um while a student at MIT but you know

776
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,760
for the most part we see people going

777
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,200
into kind of more traditional analytics

778
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,519
data science or Consulting type of roles

779
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,039
immediately after graduating and then um

780
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:39,600
potentially pivoting more towards a

781
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:42,480
policy type role

782
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,000
later um all right so what are some of

783
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,240
the ways in which the MBM program pushed

784
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,760
you out of your comfort zone um and how

785
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,480
did that help you to you know build

786
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,320
overall growth or helped you and your

787
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,799
overall growth so examples of you know

788
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,720
where you felt you were pushed out of

789
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:02,279
your comfort

790
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,880
zone I think for me I mean obviously

791
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,159
you're like pushed out of your comfort

792
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,480
zone in terms of technical aspects for

793
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,799
sure just like that is like every single

794
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,720
day with like new problem sets new

795
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,320
questions new projects you're always

796
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,000
like trying to think out of the bubble

797
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,639
and um and really like push to learn

798
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
like learning more uh but on top of like

799
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:22,519
the technical skills I think there's a

800
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,519
lot of like personal skills that are

801
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:27,440
also developed um I know like being

802
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,039
surrounded by so many people that have

803
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,039
so many different talents have achieved

804
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,279
so much already um it's very impressive

805
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:36,320
and there's this feeling of like wow I

806
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:38,519
also want to do amazing things and that

807
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,880
just kind of creates a creates um

808
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,480
environment where everyone's really

809
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,399
trying their best and trying like to to

810
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,919
do amazing things um and and for me

811
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:51,880
that's incredible also even I remember

812
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:54,639
we had um some classes where we were um

813
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:57,320
trained like we we were helped with our

814
00:31:54,639 --> 00:32:00,200
like uh verbal speech and like

815
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,679
communication skills um I think that was

816
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,559
super interesting because I had never

817
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,760
taken one where I I received so much

818
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,240
feedback just genuine feedback on like

819
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,960
how can I um construct my sentences

820
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,519
better how can I answer um a question in

821
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,559
a like more solid um convincing way or

822
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,880
how can I transmit more confidence or

823
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,519
maturity and all of these things that um

824
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,919
was really was really interested and I

825
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:27,320
had never never really had the

826
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,720
opportunity to to like learn about

827
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,440
before

828
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,399
awesome I just have a quick question

829
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,799
I'll answer do we have Forte fellows in

830
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,960
the business analytics program and

831
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:37,679
unfortunately we do not the Forte fellow

832
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,919
program is really focused on the MBA

833
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,880
program but um we do have fellowships

834
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,760
available for um you know students who

835
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,760
apply to the business analytics program

836
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,600
they're limited um but there are some

837
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:52,720
merit-based fellowships available um all

838
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,600
right so

839
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,279
um the next question is about kind of

840
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,120
managing your time this is like the

841
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,279
million doll question we always asked

842
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,480
there's so many different things

843
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:04,600
happening how are you able to you know

844
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,440
succeed at everything and balance your

845
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,320
time among networking events community

846
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,320
events and coursework any advice for

847
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,320
that you know figuring out how to

848
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:16,760
balance your time or how to optimize um

849
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,039
what you're

850
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:22,080
doing I can start with this um something

851
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:24,039
I will say that was helpful for me at

852
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,919
least with managing my time is the fact

853
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:27,799
that at least in the fall semester all

854
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,760
the mband have the exact same schedule

855
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:32,240
so you're taking all the same classes

856
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,919
going to the same office hours whatever

857
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,639
um so something that was helpful for me

858
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,480
was getting into like study groups early

859
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:40,679
on and just like all of us we know the

860
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,399
same deadlines um and we can kind of

861
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:45,159
help each other solve problems um I

862
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:47,039
guess looking at different perspectives

863
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:49,320
like also helps to solve problems more

864
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,200
quickly um and then on top of that going

865
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,840
to office hours was really helpful

866
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,399
because sometimes you you'll just be

867
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,840
staring at a problem and you might be

868
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,039
kind of stubborn like me being like no

869
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,159
no no I want to figure this out but I

870
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:01,720
mean we have some great um PhD students

871
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,240
as our Tas that are always willing to

872
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,960
help and um they have different

873
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,440
perspective as well which is really

874
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:14,679
beneficial for um just like learning so

875
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:17,200
yeah great awesome um all right oh go

876
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,839
ahead no I was just gonna say one thing

877
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,720
I think a very important thing that I

878
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:23,440
learned too during my program is not to

879
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,079
get too like focused and stressed about

880
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,240
one particular thing like maybe a

881
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:28,679
homework assignment or an exam I know it

882
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,839
can be very very stressful because you

883
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,480
know those are the main things that are

884
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,679
related to grades and like when you're

885
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,560
in your University the only thing you

886
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,399
care about is getting a good grade uh

887
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,480
but at the end of the day I would say my

888
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,440
biggest recommendation is there's so

889
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,760
much that you can do in MIT and there's

890
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,000
so many opportunities whether it's like

891
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,119
um different like activities or meeting

892
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,800
new people or networking events or like

893
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:53,440
there's so many things even doing a um a

894
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,359
project with like a a professor or

895
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,440
whatever and my my my recommendation is

896
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:00,079
essentially make sure that prior like

897
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,440
you understand your priorities like what

898
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,280
do you want to gain out of this master

899
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,240
um what do you want to like discover

900
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,760
what do you want to learn about and keep

901
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,520
those as priorities and don't let some

902
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,640
like homework that you haven't figured

903
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,359
out 100% of it um like take up all of

904
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,760
your all of your

905
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:22,480
time good

906
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:27,040
advice um as an international student

907
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,040
how challenging was the job market

908
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,119
I mean I will um I can start by saying

909
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,000
the job market in general is challenging

910
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,359
it's not necessarily more challenging

911
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,800
for international students except you

912
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:41,880
know from our experience most of the

913
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,680
students that are international that

914
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,680
come to this to study with us and

915
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,200
business analytics are hoping to stay in

916
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,920
the United States at least for their

917
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,119
first role um and so kind of that on top

918
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:57,240
of you know a challenging job market in

919
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:59,480
general um can you know can uh be

920
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,520
stressed certainly but our career

921
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,000
development team is really dedicated to

922
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,560
partnering with you and helping to

923
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,040
support you throughout your entire

924
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,280
career search you know this past year

925
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,760
the graduating class um a little over

926
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,640
30% of the students went to Capstone

927
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,200
companies so that's um a great

928
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,760
opportunity for you to kind of get to

929
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,640
know the company and get a feel for the

930
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,480
organization and about 30% of students

931
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,480
went to Capstone Partners um for

932
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,800
full-time employment um and then another

933
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:31,079
15% or so also found jobs through um the

934
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,640
analytics lab class so that's similar to

935
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,599
Capstone you're able to expose um and

936
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,319
get to know a bit more about how

937
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,400
companies operate through um you know

938
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:43,319
the analytics class and the projects

939
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,359
that you work on within that class um

940
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:48,160
and you know uh there's lots of there's

941
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:50,240
lots of different paths that people take

942
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,119
but we do understand most students are

943
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,280
looking to stay in the US um and luckily

944
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,040
we are a stem certified program so that

945
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,359
allows you for you know up to 3 years

946
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,319
of um an ability to hold a Visa and work

947
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:05,680
in the United States but do our

948
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:07,319
panelists have any other advice or um

949
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,800
you know

950
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:11,880
suggestions no I would I would say um

951
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,760
you're definitely right like MIT has

952
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,160
really strong connections with companies

953
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,920
that that's mainly because they've

954
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,240
worked with them for like many years

955
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,640
through Capstone analytics lab um and

956
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,880
that just means that like these

957
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,119
companies really trust uh students that

958
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,760
come out of the mban program they have a

959
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,240
lot of a lot of mban alumni in in their

960
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,000
companies already so it's like very it's

961
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,440
much easier to just join their company

962
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,319
because you'll have people that have

963
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,079
gone through the exact same uh program

964
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,839
as you um and they'll just be more

965
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,960
they're just more willing to hire you

966
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,560
which is really nice and again there's

967
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:46,280
so much support like every time there's

968
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,760
a new job opening we're we're um told

969
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,760
about it we're informed we have the

970
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,119
opportunity to apply we can have a lot

971
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,160
of referrals to from previous alumni

972
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:55,920
which is very useful so I would say like

973
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,200
the job opportunities that we get are

974
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,040
amazing so don't stress about it a lot

975
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,800
of people are willing to are wanting to

976
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:07,839
stay in the US and definitely achieve

977
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:09,920
that um so yeah awes all right so um a c

978
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,280
one last question um that's been asked a

979
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,000
couple different times is always a

980
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,440
question I like to wrap things up with

981
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,200
is you know do you have a piece of

982
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:20,359
advice for you know people who um are in

983
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,319
the process of you know navigating the

984
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:25,240
application process or thinking about

985
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:27,079
which master's program to to attend so

986
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,440
anyone have any advice to share for our

987
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,440
audience

988
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,520
today I'd say that um if you're thinking

989
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,760
about applying to mband just be yourself

990
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,079
I know it sounds cheesy but really mban

991
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,240
really values diversity of background

992
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:44,880
whether that's like different countries

993
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,800
background of experience in terms of

994
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,079
whether you have work experience or not

995
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,119
background in terms of what you've

996
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,520
studied so just be yourself and let your

997
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,240
authentic um experience shine through in

998
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,319
the interview process I think that's the

999
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,560
most important thing and then also come

1000
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:00,359
to MIT with an open mind because you're

1001
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,560
going to meet so many inspiring

1002
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:04,200
wonderful people from around the world

1003
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,040
and you'll learn so much so just coming

1004
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,920
in with an open mind and being yourself

1005
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,359
I'd say that's the main

1006
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,839
thing great advice anyone have anything

1007
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:12,839
else to

1008
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,200
add just don't be afraid to apply I know

1009
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,440
it sounds it sounds easy but like I

1010
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,160
remember myself back like two years ago

1011
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,400
just being like there's no way like why

1012
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,000
would I even apply they're never going

1013
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,839
to take me like it's it's MIT but um

1014
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,720
yeah don't don't not give you the the

1015
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,640
opportunity like definitely apply you'll

1016
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,400
see what what the results are later on

1017
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,839
but you would regret it if you wouldn't

1018
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,839
apply
