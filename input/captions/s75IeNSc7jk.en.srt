00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,600
One thing we're noticing is that we are

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,320
very quickly moving from LLMs and chat

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,519
bots to AI agents. And this is going to

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,400
open up an entirely new way of

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,199
collaborating with AI and producing

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,119
productivity, performance, creativity,

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,680
and other types of gains from

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,279
investments in AI. So what is this

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,080
agentic age? What are these AI agents?

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,880
Chat bots can produce text. Image

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,239
diffusion models can produce images, but

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,960
AI agents can reason and they have

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,920
multimodal capabilities to access

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,520
information on their own, to access the

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,320
web, to make decisions, to take actions.

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,120
They can essentially do almost

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,879
everything that a human can do. This is

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,800
the next era of human AI collaboration.
