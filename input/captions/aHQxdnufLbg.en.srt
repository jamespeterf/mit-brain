1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,199
we have seen I would say three sets of

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,119
tools applied to the problem of

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,960
projection theory. So at the beginning

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,279
of the class first we talked about like

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,240
double counting and then we talked about

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,160
methods from 4A analysis and then in the

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,519
last week we started our our third set

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,760
of tools which are tools from

9
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,000
combinatorial number theory. Um so um so

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,680
this week we're going to finish our unit

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,480
on tools from combinatorial number

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,559
theory and projection theory.

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,719
Okay. So uh the the goal for these two

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,200
weeks

15
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,399
is this projection theorem of banan cats

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,559
and tao and it takes place over finite

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,399
fields and the cool thing about it is

18
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,160
that it distinguishes what's true over

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,840
prime fields from what's true over other

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,879
fields which none of our previous

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,760
methods could could distinguish.

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,479
Okay,

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,479
so this is our goal

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:18,960
says that if x is a subset of fp^ 2 and

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,159
it has size p to the sx, you can think

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,240
of sx sort of like a dimension and sx is

27
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,400
in between zero and two. So it's not too

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,920
tiny and it's not everything. And we

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,720
have a set of directions in FP.

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,600
set of directions has size P to the SD

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,600
and it's not too tiny.

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,759
um then if I take the maximum over all

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,280
of the directions of the size of the

34
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:51,680
projection in that direction so at least

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,240
um so the square root of x that so far

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,280
that's not difficult to do um but then

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,560
plus times a little bit more time p to

38
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,280
the epsilon I'll call it epsilon p to

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,759
the epsilon so this epsilon

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,000
depends on these dimensions but it's

41
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,000
positive

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,360
Okay, so that's our goal and it's

43
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,200
significant

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,480
that this would not be true in other

45
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,560
fields. So this is false

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,840
in um f q^2

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:30,000
if q= p^2.

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:37,120
Um and the example is

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,040
that x is fp^2 and d is fp.

50
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,040
And so then this thing is always fp.

51
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,440
Okay,

52
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,599
cool. So, even though this epsilon is a

53
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,519
really tiny number, which we could make

54
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,680
explicit if we worked hard, but we would

55
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,720
then be disappointed. Uh, even though

56
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,280
it's really tiny, um, this theorem is

57
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,080
qualitatively an important improvement

58
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,599
and it it has lots of applications. This

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,440
and the version overr have lots of

60
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,959
applications and almost everything in

61
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,200
the rest of the course would will be

62
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,159
based on that kind of whatever most of

63
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,159
the directions we might go in.

64
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,159
Okay.

65
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,879
All right.

66
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,959
So last week we introduced combinatorial

67
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,959
number theory and sum product theory and

68
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,040
we proved a theorem which is in this

69
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,959
direction.

70
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,400
It's kind of the special case when x

71
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,680
happens to be a product set a cross a.

72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,599
So our theorem one was last time if A is

73
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:45,440
in FP

74
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:49,360
and the size of A is P to the S A

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:56,360
and D is a set of directions in FP.

76
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Uh and size of D is P to the SD.

77
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:07,360
Um then if you take the maximum t

78
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:12,159
of a + t * a which would be like pi subt

79
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:17,879
of a cross a then that's at least um the

80
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,879
size of a * p to the epsilon 1

81
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,759
that's a little bit bigger and this

82
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,000
again would be false in other fields. So

83
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,680
if if if our field had a sub field, you

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,120
could choose these guys to both be the

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,759
sub field and this would stay in the sub

86
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,160
field.

87
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,759
Okay, cool.

88
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,199
All right, so uh our goal today is to

89
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,639
get from here to there.

90
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,240
And we were talking about it last time

91
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,880
and I wanted to So at first this looks

92
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,240
like a very special case. Um I'll try to

93
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,919
argue that it's only a little bit

94
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,160
special case and we'll see what what the

95
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,160
issue is.

96
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,479
Okay.

97
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,040
Um, so let me call this an attempt

98
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:14,600
at BKT

99
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,600
using uh theorem one.

100
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,880
Okay. So we're going to do a proof by

101
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,880
contradiction.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,199
We're going to say epsilon is very small

103
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:31,280
and it's to be decided.

104
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:37,600
And so then we'll assume

105
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:40,320
that pi t of x is less than x * p to the

106
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,880
epsilon for all the t's in d. So proof

107
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,759
by contradiction. So we can assume that

108
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,840
um and also without loss of generality

109
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,840
we can suppose that zero and infinity

110
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,560
are in our set of directions d. So in

111
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,759
other words we include the horizontal

112
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,039
projection and the vertical projection.

113
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:03,280
So then we can make a set a so that a *

114
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:08,080
a contains x and x is most of a * a. So

115
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:12,720
the set A is pi 0 of X union pi infinity

116
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:16,080
of X or the size of A bounded by size of

117
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:20,160
X to the half * P to the epsilon

118
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,160
and and X is contained in A * A.

119
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Okay.

120
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,000
[Applause]

121
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,520
So x is a big subset of a product and we

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,800
can apply theorem one to our product.

123
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,880
[Applause]

124
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:43,660
So theorem one tells us that the maximum

125
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:46,849
t and d of pi t of a * a is big

126
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,849
[Applause]

127
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,360
and even bigger than that. So it's this

128
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,280
is this could be epsilon 1. Um and

129
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,880
epsilon 1 is much bigger than epsilon.

130
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,639
So epsilon one came from a theorem

131
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,319
that's already proven. It's some number

132
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,599
and we get to choose epsilon as small as

133
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,759
we like. So we choose it much smaller

134
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,759
than epsilon.

135
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,800
Okay.

136
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,560
But this is not yet the

137
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,880
projection theorem that we're aiming

138
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,880
for. And the issue is

139
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:27,680
we would like pi t of x to be big.

140
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:33,960
So the issue is maybe pi t of x

141
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,960
is much smaller than pi t of a cross a

142
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,039
even though x is is a big chunk of a

143
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,720
cross a.

144
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,720
Let me make a picture of this enemy

145
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,720
scenario.

146
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,000
So here's the end of the scenario.

147
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,660
[Applause]

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
All right.

149
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:05,840
So there's a set X

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,120
which has a small projection.

151
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,840
So we're going to be doing a projection

152
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,840
say in this direction.

153
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,080
projection at x is small.

154
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,800
[Applause]

155
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,879
Okay. And x is a big portion of this

156
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:28,879
larger set a cross a.

157
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,120
So in blue we have a cross ax.

158
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,440
And when we project that down, then we

159
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,000
see

160
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,000
a lot of stuff.

161
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,360
Pi t a cross a without x. So we're

162
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,760
worried that we may be so unlucky that

163
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,320
even though pi t of a cross a is quite

164
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,160
large and even though x is a big chunk

165
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:58,200
of a cross a, nevertheless pi t of x is

166
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,200
small. We're worried about that.

167
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,120
Okay, so that's where we left off before

168
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,000
vacation.

169
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,320
And now what I'd like everyone to do is

170
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,560
to try to think of an example where this

171
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,800
happens. Does this ever actually happen

172
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,680
that inside of a cross a you have a

173
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,000
large subset x and the projection of x

174
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,279
is small even though the projection of a

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,959
cross a is big?

176
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,440
Can you think of an example where that

177
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,080
actually happens?

178
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,600
>> Yeah,

179
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,360
>> you could choose X to be like a

180
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,800
diagonal.

181
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:42,800
So like all the values like guess I I is

182
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,760
in FP,

183
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,600
>> right? Okay. So,

184
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,320
so here's an example. So X, so X is

185
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,560
going to be contained in A cross A. X is

186
00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:00,000
the set of all A comma A

187
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,519
and A cross A. And so then if I take the

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
projection

189
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,920
um I guess in the direction minus one of

190
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
X I just get zero. A minus A is always

191
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:16,160
zero. So this is extremely small. Um

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,600
okay but in this case this X is quite a

193
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,839
bit smaller than the whole A cross A.

194
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,120
So let me make a more pre uh precise

195
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:30,000
question. Um

196
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:33,040
so let's say a has size n

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,920
and x is a subset of a cross a and it's

198
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,920
really quite big. So I'm going to say x

199
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,440
is bigger than well we're going to call

200
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:45,360
it for now k inverse time n^2. Um but

201
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,360
then maybe k is order of n to the 1

202
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,360
over,000.

203
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,440
So it's really a big portion of a cross

204
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,440
a

205
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:02,880
and

206
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:07,160
pi t of x is like way smaller

207
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,160
than pi t.

208
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,480
We could make that more precise too if

209
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,480
we wanted to.

210
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,040
And that that's the situation we have in

211
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,040
our attempt, right?

212
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:29,680
A is only a bit bigger than X. And so

213
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,640
um let's say the size of A is N. It's

214
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,959
just the definition of N. And then X

215
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,519
would be bigger than like P to the minus

216
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,880
a few epsilon

217
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:44,360
size of A plus. So it's really a a good

218
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,360
portion of that.

219
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,760
Okay.

220
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,959
Right. So, could it still happen that

221
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,720
the size of the projection of X is way

222
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,279
smaller than the size of the projection

223
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,279
of the whole thing?

224
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:12,160
>> Like can you like pigeon hole principles

225
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,440
like the fibers of the projection cross?

226
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,120
>> Yeah.

227
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,560
And that like if X is big enough, you

228
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,480
know, it has to be at least

229
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,079
some nice number of those,

230
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,880
>> right? So the suggestion is we can look

231
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:30,000
at all of the fibers of the projection

232
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:35,160
of A cross A and then we should pick X

233
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,160
to be the union of of the big fibers.

234
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,040
Yeah. Yeah, that's right. That's right.

235
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,120
So in this enemy scenario, there have to

236
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,639
be some very big fibers and some much

237
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,040
smaller fibers. They have to be kind of

238
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,360
different from each other.

239
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,240
Yeah.

240
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:56,160
Um Okay. But let's see if we can think

241
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:59,560
of an example where this happens.

242
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,560
That should erase

243
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,680
some space.

244
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,560
Okay. So, um I just going to continue

245
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,560
below the line here.

246
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,000
Okay. So first of all, can we even think

247
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,600
of an example where the projection of of

248
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,320
X or something would be small at all? Um

249
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,240
so so an example um maybe X could be the

250
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,880
numbers from one up to N cross the

251
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:44,079
numbers from one up to N

252
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:46,079
and then pi 1 of X is pretty small

253
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,079
would be basically introduced from one

254
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,760
up to 2N.

255
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,600
So this would be quite small.

256
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,600
Okay.

257
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Um,

258
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,320
so you could make you could make this a

259
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,399
so x would be all of a cross a. Then the

260
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,399
projection of a cross a would be small.

261
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,480
But you could also inflate a to make it

262
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,600
bigger than that.

263
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,839
So we could take a to be the integers

264
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,880
from one up to n union a tilda.

265
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:25,560
Maybe the size of a tilda is also n but

266
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,560
a tilda is unstructured or random.

267
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:34,720
[Applause]

268
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:38,079
Okay. So now if I take

269
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,440
pi 1 of a cross a,

270
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,000
it's at least as big as pi 1 of a tilda

271
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,320
cross a tilda.

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,920
and a tilda has nothing to do with

273
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,880
numbers from one up to n. I could build

274
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,880
some set where that's big.

275
00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:00,560
Okay, but pi 1 of x

276
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,320
is only around n.

277
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,639
So there could be a big gap between

278
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,639
these guys.

279
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,959
Um

280
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,880
but this example is not so not such a

281
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,279
problem for our strategy because in this

282
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,320
example we just should have chosen the

283
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,079
set A smaller. We'd like a to be we

284
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,560
could we could choose a as we like. We

285
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,639
could choose a smaller set a so that a

286
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,160
actually with the smaller choice of a

287
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:34,360
just these guys x would be a cross a and

288
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,360
then we would be happy.

289
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,560
Okay. So the key to the proof of uh of

290
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,800
banan cat's tao is a theorem from

291
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,800
cominator. It's called the balog sum

292
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,680
gowowers theorem and it says that this

293
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,000
example is pretty much the only way that

294
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,720
pi 1 of x could be much smaller than pi

295
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,720
1 of a cross a.

296
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Okay.

297
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,980
[Applause]

298
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,600
All right.

299
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,440
This is called the balag seme gow

300
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:30,240
theorem and it's uh another of the kind

301
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,320
of uh central tools in the toolbox of

302
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,240
additive combinatorics along with the

303
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,880
plunicarusa inequalities that we talked

304
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:42,399
about last time. All right. So it says

305
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:47,880
if a and b are contained in an aelion

306
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,880
group and they have size at most n

307
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:59,560
uh and I have a subset of a cross b

308
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,560
which is significant.

309
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,919
It's a significant fraction

310
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:10,280
and the projection of this subset in

311
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,280
some direction is small.

312
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,280
So, so here I want you to imagine that K

313
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,360
is a lot smaller than N. So this is a

314
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,199
big chunk of all the pairs A and B. And

315
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,280
the smallest this could possibly be is

316
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,080
around N because if you just fix one

317
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,919
element of B, you'd have around N

318
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,000
choices for this element of A. So that

319
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,919
would already give you a round N here.

320
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,039
So this is almost as small as possible.

321
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,360
And then the conclusion is

322
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,280
it's not necessarily the case that pi t

323
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,000
of all of a cross b is small. We just

324
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,600
saw a counter example to that. But we

325
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,440
could find big pieces of a and b so that

326
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,000
the projection of the big pieces is

327
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:03,679
small. So then there exists a prime and

328
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:09,760
b prime which are subsets of a and b. A

329
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:12,240
prime and a b prime and b. So that um

330
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,559
I'll say x prime is defined to be a

331
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:20,320
prime cross b prime intersect x

332
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:21,840
and x prime is still a big fraction of

333
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,880
n^2.

334
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,960
So k to the minus some constant power

335
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,760
time n^2

336
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:35,520
and if I take pi t of a a prime a prime

337
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:39,440
cross b prime that is less than k to

338
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:43,880
some power* l.

339
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,880
So this is small.

340
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,320
So in this example here

341
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,640
where a was like this, this part here

342
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,120
would be the a prime and it would be

343
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,600
symmetric in the a b prime and a prime

344
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,600
would both be this.

345
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,840
Okay, take a moment to digest that

346
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,080
statement and see if you have questions

347
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,080
or comments.

348
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,120
Okay.

349
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,960
Um so we will prove this probably

350
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,440
starting later today but but most of it

351
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,919
next class. Um but for the rest of this

352
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,520
class we'll explore uh explore why this

353
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,840
is useful and in particular we'll use it

354
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,840
to prove the projection theorem. Okay.

355
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,160
Okay. Um,

356
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:45,750
[Applause]

357
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,440
all right. So let's do the proof

358
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,440
of the Borgan textile projection

359
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,440
theorem.

360
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,919
Okay. So let's say epsilon is small to

361
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,320
be decided. We're going to prove there's

362
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,840
some small epsilon where this is true.

363
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:27,760
And I'm going to write I write C less

364
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:34,440
than tilda tilda D. It means that C is

365
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:34,440
less than P to the big O of epsilon * D.

366
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,520
Okay.

367
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,720
And now we're going to do a proof by

368
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,960
contradiction. So we can suppose

369
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,760
pi t of x

370
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,360
is less sim less than or equal to p to

371
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:54,760
the epsilon * x to the half for all the

372
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,760
t and d.

373
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,400
Okay. Um without loss of generality I

374
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,240
can suppose that zero or infinity are in

375
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:08,240
my directions and I'll take a to be pi 0

376
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,720
of x union pi infinity of x.

377
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,039
And so now I know that x is a subset of

378
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,760
a cross a.

379
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:22,480
Um I'll say a size of a could be n and

380
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:26,840
that is tilda tilda the square root of x

381
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,840
up to some powers of p to the epsilon.

382
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,400
Okay. And uh therefore x is greater

383
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:37,679
tilda tilda n^ 2. So x is a big fraction

384
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,440
of all of a cross a.

385
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:44,960
Oh,

386
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:52,159
next um I choose some other t1

387
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:55,440
in D and I know that pi t1 of x is less

388
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:58,440
than tilda tilda n.

389
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,440
Okay.

390
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,200
And so when I once I know this the

391
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:08,080
bality gowowers theorem tells me that it

392
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:12,480
this comes from a product a prime a

393
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:14,559
prime cross b prime. So sarity gow

394
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:19,440
theorem says

395
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:21,919
this a prime and a b prime and b and x

396
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,520
prime is the part of x in this product a

397
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:29,520
prime cross b prime. So first of all, x

398
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:36,280
prime is still quite substantial and pi

399
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,280
t1 of a prime cross b prime is small.

400
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:46,120
And this means in other words that a

401
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:46,120
prime plus t1 b prime is small.

402
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:00,640
Okay.

403
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:02,799
And this here is

404
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,480
um

405
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,640
this information here we c uh is is is

406
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,360
is strong in a helpful way that's

407
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,880
stronger than this because here we can

408
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,880
use the pluna rou inequalities.

409
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:24,960
So once we know that a prime plus t1 b

410
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:28,559
prime is small then plunicar rouia

411
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,440
inequalities tell us that lots of other

412
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,360
things are small. So for example a prime

413
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,520
plus or minus a prime is also small. Um

414
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,919
if I wanted to

415
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,280
uh I could do a triple sum a prime plus

416
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,679
a prime plus a prime is also small dot

417
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,480
dot dot. You could do the same with B

418
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,039
prime.

419
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,840
Okay. So,

420
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,880
so now we have see that A prime and B

421
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,400
prime have a lot of structure.

422
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,520
Have a lot of structure. And actually,

423
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,520
I'll use the word symmetry.

424
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,720
All right.

425
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,559
Right. Okay.

426
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,120
Okay. So I actually I'll draw you a

427
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,760
picture in a minute of how I visualize

428
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,760
this and why why I use the word

429
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,760
symmetry.

430
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,760
Okay.

431
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,760
So next

432
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:32,480
[Applause]

433
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,840
so I have to make space I'm going to

434
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,279
erase the statement of the theorem.

435
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,480
We're going to try to prove that one of

436
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:39,480
the projections of x is big.

437
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,000
All right.

438
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:58,159
All right. So now have a lema. It says

439
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,679
if I have a subset y and a prime cross b

440
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,440
prime, the subset we're going to care

441
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:06,640
about is just x prime, but the lema is

442
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:10,320
more general. Um, okay. And um a prime

443
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:14,919
and b prime have these nice properties.

444
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,919
So I'll just copy these two.

445
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:24,039
So a prime + t1 b prime

446
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,039
is small.

447
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:32,880
A prime minus A prime is small and and Y

448
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,159
itself is is is fairly large

449
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,919
although I don't need to write it in the

450
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,360
statement.

451
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:42,720
Um then

452
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:47,880
pi t of y so this is for any t so t is

453
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,880
just anybody in fp different from t1.

454
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:57,279
This guy is bigger than tilda tilda

455
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:01,279
y / n^2

456
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:03,440
times pi in a different direction

457
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,880
t over t1

458
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,880
of a prime cross a prime.

459
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,559
Right? So we have a

460
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,720
the biggest y could be is it could be

461
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,919
have size around n squ in which case

462
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,840
this would disappear.

463
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,559
And so I say if we have a large subset

464
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,279
of a prime cross b prime then the

465
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:33,840
projection of that large subset y is

466
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,720
bigger than the projection in a related

467
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,200
angle of a whole product a prime cross a

468
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,720
prime. This is good for us because we

469
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:47,919
can apply theorem one to this.

470
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:51,120
Um and um this is

471
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,200
uh this inequality kind kind of ruling

472
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,120
out the enemy scenario. We're ruling out

473
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,960
the possibility that there's a big chunk

474
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,720
of a prime cross b prime that got

475
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,720
compressed even though the whole thing

476
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,720
didn't.

477
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:09,480
Okay, let me put over here some uh

478
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,480
intuition.

479
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,799
So my intuition is

480
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,039
that a prime cross b prime is very

481
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,200
symmetric.

482
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,440
And so let me draw an exaggerated

483
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,240
version. Suppose that a prime cross b

484
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,240
prime just looked like a lattice.

485
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:36,000
Okay.

486
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,640
And inside of there we have some

487
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,640
substantial but kind of unstructured set

488
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Y.

489
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,440
All right.

490
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,960
So if there were some angle where the

491
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,640
projection of Y got compressed a lot. I

492
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,440
claim that compression of the the whole

493
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:59,679
lattice should get compressed a lot.

494
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,600
Why? Because the lattice is symmetric.

495
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,240
So I can cover the lattice by some

496
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,840
translates of y and if each of those

497
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,080
gets compressed a lot then the whole

498
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,080
lattice should be compressed a lot.

499
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,679
So

500
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,799
recover

501
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,600
a prime cross b prime by a few

502
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,600
translates of y.

503
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,840
And then we would get that the

504
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:32,000
projection of the whole thing

505
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:35,720
should be bounded by a few times the

506
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,720
projection of y.

507
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,760
Okay. So now let's carry out this

508
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,039
intuition. We are going to cover y uh

509
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:54,840
cover a prime cover something uh by

510
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,840
translates of y.

511
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,960
Okay.

512
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,240
Um

513
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:08,720
so let's consider

514
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:12,919
y + t1 t2. These are some translates of

515
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,919
y set of these guys

516
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:23,440
where t1 is an a prime cross a prime

517
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:26,799
minus a prime and t2 is in um this

518
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,760
slightly weird looking thing

519
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,760
there.

520
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,760
Okay. And so these are a bunch of

521
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,279
translates of y. And these translates of

522
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,240
y

523
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:47,760
cover uh

524
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,720
cover somebody a lot of times. So for

525
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,919
every um

526
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,039
every y1 y2

527
00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:01,360
let me do it this way. So for every a1

528
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:04,000
a2 in a prime cross a prime and for

529
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:10,559
every y1 y2

530
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,240
in y there is a unique t1 t2 which is in

531
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:19,039
this list.

532
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:24,679
Um so that uh a1 so that y1 y2

533
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:24,679
plus t1 t2 is a1h.

534
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,679
So this is easier to prove than it is to

535
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:34,480
write down.

536
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:38,080
Just solve for t1. t1 must be y1 a1

537
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:42,080
minus y1. And uh and these these guys

538
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:46,080
both live in a prime. So t1 is in there.

539
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,480
Um and uh

540
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,320
um ah

541
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,080
wait

542
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,320
yeah sorry. So this is going to have to

543
00:30:52,080 --> 00:31:01,440
be -1 over t1 a prime.

544
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:05,760
Okay. Now how does y2 work? um for every

545
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,799
uh so t2 is going to be a2 minus y2

546
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,520
and the uh

547
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:18,520
the a2

548
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:18,520
lives in b prime and the uh

549
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Um

550
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,200
yeah.

551
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:54,000
So the a2 lives here and the um y2 lives

552
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,559
here. So the difference lives here where

553
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,559
it's supposed to.

554
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Okay.

555
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:09,880
So So these translates

556
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,840
of y

557
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:20,080
cover a prime cross -1 over t1 a prime.

558
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,399
They cover it

559
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,559
y times.

560
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:28,880
I cover each point in here y times

561
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,760
because for each point in here I have y

562
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:36,640
norm of y cardality of y choices for

563
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:38,399
this guy and then uh there's one one in

564
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,039
translation a set of translations that

565
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,039
that lands here.

566
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,039
Okay, does this sentence make sense?

567
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,039
So we have rigged it that we've taken a

568
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,240
bunch of translations of this set y and

569
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,880
we have covered a nice uh product many

570
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,480
times and the product we actually could

571
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,840
have arranged the product to be a prime

572
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,600
cross b prime that would have been a

573
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,960
little easier than what we did but we

574
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,320
have arranged that the product that

575
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,559
we've covered is a prime cross a um

576
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,840
dilation of a prime and that's a little

577
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,960
bit better technically because it's

578
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,960
going to be closer to theorem one.

579
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:27,760
Okay. Now notice that this guy is small

580
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:32,960
by hypothesis and this set here is also

581
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:36,080
small. This is uh just a dilate of this.

582
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,720
So these sets are small. So we took a

583
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:42,320
few translations of Y and we covered

584
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,159
this um product many times. And that

585
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,840
means that at least typically each of

586
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,080
the translations was covering a lot of

587
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,080
the product.

588
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:56,080
Okay. So that matches this intuition.

589
00:33:53,679 --> 00:34:00,240
So then we can say

590
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:05,360
that pi t of a prime

591
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:09,760
cross -1 / t t1 a prime

592
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:12,960
that guy is bounded by um

593
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,839
okay so

594
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:21,760
um so we're going to take

595
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:25,679
a prime minus a prime times um

596
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,960
a prime plus t1 b prime. This is how

597
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,720
many copies of y we took. For each one

598
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,000
of them we have a projection. So that

599
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,560
has the size pi t of y.

600
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:42,040
And after doing that we've covered every

601
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,040
point here y times. So we have this guy.

602
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:57,200
Okay. These are hypothesis bounded by n.

603
00:34:52,399 --> 00:35:01,000
So this is n^2 over y

604
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,000
pi t of y.

605
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,040
And that's basically our final

606
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:13,200
inequality. Put the pi t of y by itself.

607
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:15,359
Pi t of y is greater tilda tilda y / n^2

608
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,680
times the size of this thingy which is

609
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:23,800
equivalent to

610
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,800
pi t / t1 a prime cross

611
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,200
Okay, take a moment with that.

612
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Okay.

613
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,720
Um, so now let's finish the proof of the

614
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,720
DK theorem.

615
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,179
All right.

616
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,179
[Applause]

617
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,079
So, we would like to estimate the

618
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,079
maximum t in our direction set of pi t

619
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,079
of x.

620
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,800
That's at least

621
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:06,000
the maximum t in our direction set of pi

622
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,520
t of x prime.

623
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,520
We're following up from over here. And

624
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:14,240
here's x prime, which is a big chunk of

625
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:19,040
a prime cross cross b prime.

626
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:22,000
Okay. And now we can apply our lema.

627
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:26,000
So the lema says

628
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,560
that is at least as big as the maximum t

629
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:36,160
in our direction set x prime / n^2. And

630
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:39,160
then we have pi - t / t1 a prime cross a

631
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,160
prime.

632
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,720
Okay. Now x prime we already determined

633
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,960
has size about n^2. So this factor

634
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,599
disappears.

635
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,160
And now we are looking at projections in

636
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,160
many different directions of a prime

637
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,040
cross a prime. That's exactly the thing

638
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:02,320
that theorem one told us about.

639
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:08,960
So by theorem one

640
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:11,440
this is now greater sim sim n times um p

641
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,920
to the epsilon one

642
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,320
and that's the proof.

643
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,320
So one of these is significantly bigger

644
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,320
than

645
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,240
the square<unk> of x * p to the epsilon

646
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,240
1

647
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Okay,

648
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:08,160
let me put up on here a little summary

649
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,240
of what we did and then uh and then I'll

650
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,359
let you look at the

651
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,400
look down from above at the whole thing.

652
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,760
So we're trying to get from theorem one

653
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,320
to theorem bkt.

654
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,680
And the enemy

655
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,320
was that we have a set x in a cross a

656
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,599
where x is around the same size as a

657
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:35,520
cross a but

658
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:37,440
the size of a projection of x is uh much

659
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,520
smaller than the size of the projection

660
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,760
of a cross a. That's our enemy.

661
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,640
And we learned two pieces of wisdom

662
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,280
about this enemy. One in the BSG theorem

663
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:55,359
and one in the lema.

664
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:59,200
So wisdom one in the enemy situation

665
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:01,200
um X lives in a smaller product

666
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,880
and the projection of the smaller

667
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,520
product.

668
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,359
So this the projection of the smaller

669
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,040
product

670
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,599
well it doesn't live in that but it has

671
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:15,760
a so the enemy situation implies that X

672
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,000
intersected with the smaller product is

673
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,160
about the same as X. So a good chunk of

674
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,640
X lives in a smaller product and the

675
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:27,240
projection of the smaller product is

676
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,240
about the same as the projection of X.

677
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,599
Okay. So then we look at that situation

678
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:37,920
and the second piece of wisdom was that

679
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:40,640
if uh the projection of a smaller

680
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,640
product of a product

681
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,160
um

682
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:49,520
if this is small

683
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,440
um so if this is around

684
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,200
the smallest it could be would be one of

685
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,599
the factors for one t1 then this product

686
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,640
becomes very symmetrical

687
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:04,720
and Then the conclusion is for any

688
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,770
subset X prime in the in this thing

689
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,880
which is substantial

690
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:10,400
[Applause]

691
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,200
then

692
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,359
the projection of the subset actually is

693
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,319
around the same as their direction the

694
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,319
projection of the whole product.

695
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,200
So the enemy situation can only really

696
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,800
happen because X was mostly in a a

697
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,880
smaller product that had a small

698
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,000
projection

699
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,480
and this situation is very symmetrical.

700
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,640
So if a smaller product has one small

701
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,800
projection then when you project it in

702
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,960
other angles then um the projection of a

703
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,079
big piece of it can't be way smaller

704
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,079
than the projection of the whole thing.

705
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,920
All right.

706
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,079
So, the whole story is on these boards.

707
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,319
Uh, take a take a couple moments to look

708
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,319
it over.

709
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,800
>> Yeah.

710
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,280
>> Have a question. So, should it be the

711
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,280
case that the a prime there depends on

712
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,280
t?

713
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:15,680
>> Okay. So, the question is whether a

714
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:20,240
prime depends on t.

715
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:23,760
Um, so let's see where a prime appeared.

716
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,520
So we have uh our set with many small

717
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,480
projections

718
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:33,440
and um okay and then in particular the

719
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,359
t1 projection is small and so the balag

720
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,760
summarity gow theorem says there's a

721
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,480
prime and a and b prime and b so that

722
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,359
the t1 projection of a prime cross b

723
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,720
prime is small and this a prime depends

724
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,079
on t1

725
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,800
>> right

726
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:52,800
>> now later we're going to look at pi P of

727
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:56,240
X for other T's. Um,

728
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,920
one could, I guess, apply Boxed Gowers

729
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,480
again to those other T's, but that's not

730
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,720
what we're going to do. We we use T1 to

731
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,400
find A prime and B prime. And then we're

732
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:08,000
going to run with these same A prime and

733
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:11,040
B prime even when we look at other T's.

734
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:16,000
What did we learn? Once we have this one

735
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:19,040
small projection, we learned uh Alex Gar

736
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,720
told us this and then we learned from it

737
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,359
some other stuff. So that what we

738
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,359
actually used is this.

739
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,000
So we so we then we use this stuff. So

740
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,920
this is telling us that a prime cross b

741
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,880
prime is quite symmetrical and that's

742
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,880
what's helpful in the second part.

743
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,839
>> Good. Other questions or comments

744
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:07,119
don't we know that it's also kind of

745
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,000
Yeah, the question is why don't we know

746
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,000
that a itself is also kind of

747
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,560
symmetrical? That might depend on

748
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,680
exactly what we mean by symmetrical.

749
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,560
But um an important thing an important

750
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,680
way that a prime is better than a is

751
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,960
that at this moment um

752
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,920
a prime minus a prime is small. And we

753
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,920
didn't know that about a. A could be,

754
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,200
you know, you can think of A prime as A

755
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,839
as being A prime plus some garbage and

756
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,839
the garbage minus garbage is is not

757
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,839
small.

758
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,920
Why the the epsilon

759
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,839
>> like the epsilon is different between

760
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,400
the two because

761
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,920
>> of the a prime plus minus a prime has

762
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,359
like

763
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,480
there's like a hidden factor there

764
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,079
right?

765
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,319
>> Yes.

766
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,319
A prime plus minus a prime here there's

767
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,440
a hidden factor which is p to the order

768
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:16,800
of epsilon

769
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,640
>> and you're right it's very important

770
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,920
that the epsilon is different between

771
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:25,040
the two theorems. Um

772
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,040
so epsilon one is the epsilon in theorem

773
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,680
one which was already kind of small if

774
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,560
we had unwind the proof of theorem one

775
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:35,280
and then in theorem bkt there's an

776
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,240
epsilon and the epsilon and bkt is way

777
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,040
smaller than the epsilon one and the

778
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,560
reason we need that is um okay we

779
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,319
started with this where we have a factor

780
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:49,920
of p to the epsilon then um we did some

781
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:52,480
stuff most important stuff is bsg so bs

782
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,960
SG will lose like there'll be like a

783
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,760
factor of 10 epsilon here uh that comes

784
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,280
out of the proof of balm gowers. So here

785
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,119
the these these things will be something

786
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,839
like p to the 10 epsilon if you did them

787
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,400
carefully and then you go along and

788
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,760
we're following our proof. So here

789
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,599
there's um we did a little bit more work

790
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,400
in the proof of the lema. So there's p

791
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:16,240
of this is hiding a p of 10 or 20

792
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,160
epsilon

793
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,640
and then but here we have a gain of p to

794
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,040
the epsilon 1. So the p to the epsilon

795
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,880
one needs to dominate the p to the 20

796
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:28,800
epsilon that we lost at various steps in

797
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:32,319
this process. So epsilon should be like

798
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:35,040
120th of the size of epsilon one.

799
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:37,119
Yeah. So we have to do a whole sequence

800
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,040
of clever things to prove briang cat's

801
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,880
ta theorem and each time we do something

802
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:43,119
clever our epsilon gets smaller by a

803
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,040
factor of 10 until you know we're so

804
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,040
clever that we really can't see the

805
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,040
epsilon.

806
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,200
Yeah.

807
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,960
>> Is there a conjecture bound for what

808
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,200
possible epsilon could be?

809
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,960
>> Ah, that's a great question. Yeah. So,

810
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,720
the question is, is there a conjectured

811
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:11,920
bound about the right epsilon? Um

812
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:13,359
um yes. So, yes. So the conjecture so

813
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,200
we're working right now over finite

814
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,839
fields and the conjecture is that the

815
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,240
worst case is a lattice

816
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:22,000
and we wrote it down let's write it down

817
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,760
again but we we wrote it down at the

818
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,440
beginning of the course um

819
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,640
okay so I think we're moving on I'll put

820
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,960
it here

821
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:37,280
[Applause]

822
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:41,520
okay so suppose we have x

823
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:46,240
which is a subset of ft^2 squ and then

824
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:51,760
we're going to take the maximum t and d

825
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:54,800
pi t of x. Um, and this is bigger than I

826
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,800
think it was d to the half x to the

827
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,800
half.

828
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,079
Um,

829
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,079
maybe you should check it. I don't

830
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,160
remember these. I don't quite remember

831
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,720
these off the top of my head. So, I

832
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,480
think

833
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:17,640
And the way to remember it is that the

834
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,640
example is that X is a lattice

835
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:26,319
and then D is the set of rational

836
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,079
numbers of small slope.

837
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,520
Right? That was the case where the pro

838
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,960
the case that we've seen so far where

839
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,400
the projections are small. So if you

840
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,680
compute with this you can check whether

841
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,680
this is true or whether it needs to be

842
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,599
modified a little bit. And then if you

843
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,319
rewrite it in the language of BKT it

844
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:43,680
gives you an exact formula for epsilon

845
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:46,880
right and that is a wide openen problem

846
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:50,880
um over FP but the version over R has

847
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:53,440
been proven and and uh um I'll try at

848
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,200
least to say to say at least some of the

849
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,200
main ideas of the proof in the in the

850
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:00,200
class.

851
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,200
Yeah.

852
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,960
Okay. Um

853
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,319
so the the ideas that we've just been

854
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
talking about when um going back and

855
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:16,000
forth between whether a projection of

856
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,680
the whole product is small whether a

857
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,800
projection of a big chunk of the product

858
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:23,040
is small um that is a theme in additive

859
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,280
combinotaurics and I want to describe to

860
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,319
you some of the other key words and

861
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,160
ideas behind that theme to to flesh out

862
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,720
the lecture and see how it I don't know

863
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,720
how it fits in in general.

864
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,720
Um,

865
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:40,099
[Applause]

866
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:02,720
all right.

867
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:08,200
So section is called additive energy

868
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:08,200
versus the size of a plus b.

869
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,720
So these are two points of view about

870
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,680
measuring the additive structure

871
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:18,160
involved when you add um numbers in a to

872
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,599
numbers in b. This one we've already

873
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,520
met. Let me tell you what additive

874
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:24,079
energy is.

875
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,520
So definition

876
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:29,200
if A and B are contained in an Aelian

877
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,400
group

878
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:35,680
the energy of AB

879
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:40,960
is the number of quadruples

880
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:46,559
A1 and A2 are in A. B1 and B2

881
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:49,880
are in B. So that a1 + b1 is equal to a2

882
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,880
+ b2.

883
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,160
So if you add numbers from a and b, how

884
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,680
many coincidences are there? Does it

885
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,000
frequently happen that you get the same

886
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,240
number?

887
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,160
So another way of thinking about it is

888
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:13,440
we could say r a b of z. the number of

889
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:17,839
representations of Z as a sum somebody

890
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:22,680
in A and somebody in B. So this is the

891
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:22,680
number of ab

892
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:31,280
+ b is z.

893
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:39,400
And the additive energy ab is also equal

894
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:39,400
to the sum over z r a b of z squ.

895
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,319
So if this is large it means there are a

896
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,400
lot of numbers that can be written as a

897
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:50,119
plus b in many different ways. There are

898
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,119
many additive coincidences.

899
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:59,839
Okay. So um

900
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:01,760
so for reference if a and b both have

901
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:05,040
size n

902
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,760
then think about how big or how small

903
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:11,839
the additive energy could be. it's at

904
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:14,400
least n squared. Um that happens if so

905
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:19,800
there are n^2 obvious solutions to this

906
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,800
which are a1 equals a2 and b1 equals b2

907
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:26,000
and um if if you have kind of a random

908
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,760
set of integers or random subset of a

909
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
big group those might be only the the

910
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,520
only solutions. So here we have only

911
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,520
trivial

912
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,520
quadruples.

913
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,760
Okay. And energy is at most n cubed

914
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,680
because once you've picked three of

915
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,520
these, the fourth one is determined by

916
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,319
this equation. So there's at most n

917
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:51,319
cubed of these additive quadruples. And

918
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:51,319
um

919
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:59,119
and this happens if a= b equals a

920
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:01,839
subgroup of z.

921
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:04,000
A and b are a subgroup of z. Then

922
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:07,839
there's always a choice of b2 you can

923
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,839
pick to solve this equation.

924
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:14,720
Okay,

925
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:17,040
cool. So having large energy is sort of

926
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,640
having a lot of additive structure. And

927
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,640
before we were sort of thinking that if

928
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,040
a plus b is small then that would mean

929
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:27,400
there's a lot of additive structure. Um

930
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,400
how are those related to each other?

931
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:55,280
Okay. Um, so there's a lema

932
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:58,240
that says a * b a ^2 * b ^2 is at most

933
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,280
the size of a + b times the energy

934
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:03,440
between a and b.

935
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,680
And this is uh the proof of this is just

936
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:11,040
Koshy Schwarz.

937
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:15,760
So if I add up on Z R A B of Z

938
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:17,920
I get the size of A times the size of B.

939
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,680
This is by double counting. So every

940
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,160
time I add somebody in A and somebody in

941
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,319
B I get some Z. I add this up I get all

942
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,720
the pairs.

943
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:33,520
So now

944
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:36,240
uh a * b is the sum z of r a b of z and

945
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,720
in this sum I only need to count the

946
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,520
guys in a plus b because if z is not

947
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:44,640
cannot be written as an a plus b at all

948
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:47,760
it means that this was zero.

949
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:51,040
Okay, now I koshi Schwarz.

950
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:57,839
So I'm going to write it as the sum or a

951
00:54:51,040 --> 00:55:03,240
+ b of one to the 12 and the sum r a b

952
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:03,240
of z squared to the 12.

953
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:11,839
Okay, so that's the size of a + b to the

954
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:15,160
12 times the energy to the 12.

955
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,160
That's the per.

956
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:24,079
All right. So we see from this that if

957
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:25,920
the if a plus b is small then the energy

958
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,680
must be large. You know we could bring

959
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,800
the a plus b over to the other side. So

960
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:38,440
people usually write this the energy is

961
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:38,440
at least a 2 * b ^ 2 over a plus b.

962
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:45,760
So for instance, if a and b have size n

963
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:48,079
and a plus b is almost n, then the

964
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:52,280
energy would be at least around n cubed,

965
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,280
which is as big as it could be.

966
00:55:53,040 --> 00:56:00,400
All right? So a + b small

967
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:05,720
implies

968
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:05,720
that the energy is large.

969
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:14,720
Now, do people think you can go the

970
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:19,480
other way? If the energy is large, does

971
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,480
that imply that a plus b is small?

972
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:34,240
>> Good. No, because you could have some

973
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:37,280
garbage.

974
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:39,920
Okay. So energy

975
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:44,880
of a large

976
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:46,799
does not imply that a + b

977
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:49,280
is small.

978
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:53,920
Uh the example

979
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:55,200
is that a = b equals numbers up to n.

980
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,960
Somebody with a lot of additive

981
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:59,960
structure union some garbage.

982
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,760
Good. Now if you look at the definition

983
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,680
of the energy, if I add some extra

984
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,280
elements to A or to B, it can only

985
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,640
increase the energy perhaps not very

986
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,160
much. So the energy of this example is

987
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,240
at least the energy of this example

988
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,240
which is large.

989
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,640
On the other hand, the garbage can make

990
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,440
this a lot bigger. And this is basically

991
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:27,400
the same example that we've been

992
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,400
grappling with all class.

993
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Okay,

994
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,040
cool.

995
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:46,760
So now

996
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,760
we'll leave that up.

997
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,240
Right.

998
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,240
Okay.

999
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:17,440
Now if the energy of A and B is is small

1000
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:19,599
that implies that the size of A plus B

1001
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:22,079
is large. That's just the contraositive

1002
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:24,160
of what we wrote before or you can see

1003
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:28,119
it from this formula. If this is small

1004
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,119
then this one must be large.

1005
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,640
Right?

1006
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,640
Okay.

1007
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:37,640
Now

1008
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,640
um

1009
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:44,880
right

1010
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:48,799
now suppose I have a set x in a cross b

1011
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:53,839
and I look at pi 1 of x right. So

1012
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:55,920
remember that pi 1 of a cross b is just

1013
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:58,000
a + b.

1014
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,680
So when I take pi 1 of x it's sort of

1015
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,760
like a plus b. But I don't take all the

1016
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,760
pairs. I just take the pairs in x.

1017
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,960
Um

1018
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,960
and um

1019
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,240
um

1020
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:26,640
so if even if pi one of x were small,

1021
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:28,799
if x was a large set and pi1 of x were

1022
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,359
small, that would still produce a lot of

1023
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:35,359
energy.

1024
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:37,920
um because that would still be um a lot

1025
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:41,920
of numbers a bunch of numbers Z that

1026
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:43,839
have many representations of A plus B.

1027
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:48,079
Let me just write it down. U okay so

1028
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:49,680
yeah. So, so actually so let me recall

1029
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:53,119
that

1030
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:58,240
a + b large

1031
00:59:53,119 --> 01:00:02,319
and x being a big fraction of of a * b

1032
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:05,119
that does not imply that pi 1 of x is

1033
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:08,079
large and this is again the main thing

1034
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:13,920
that we were struggling with but with

1035
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:18,119
energy this is true. So, lama um

1036
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,119
check exactly what it says.

1037
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:38,200
So lema um x² is less than or equal to

1038
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:38,200
p1 of x times the energy of ab.

1039
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:45,200
So if the energy is small

1040
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:50,280
um then pi1 of x is pretty big for every

1041
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:50,280
subset x or every large subset x.

1042
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,720
The proof is the almost the same as the

1043
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:59,440
previous proof.

1044
01:00:54,720 --> 01:01:04,079
So proof rx of z is the number of ways

1045
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:08,720
of writing um a + b equal to z where the

1046
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:11,680
pair ab is an x and that's smaller than

1047
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:13,599
representations of z is a general sum of

1048
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:18,400
somebody a and b because we're only

1049
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:25,680
taking a a portion of the of the sums.

1050
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:28,920
Okay. So now x is the sum um on z of rx

1051
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,920
of z.

1052
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:37,200
And here in this sum we only have to

1053
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:38,960
take z's in pi 1 of x only have to

1054
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,359
consider those z's that can be written

1055
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,119
as the form a plus b where a and b are

1056
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:46,160
in x.

1057
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:51,440
So now we can koshy schwarz this and we

1058
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:54,000
get the size of pi 1 of x^ the 12

1059
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,240
times uh a kind of energy thing which is

1060
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,799
smaller than the standard energy. So we

1061
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:03,520
have the sum rx of z ^ 2 to the 12

1062
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:08,599
that's smaller than the sum ra of z ^ 2

1063
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,599
to the 12 which gives us the energy.

1064
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:18,799
Okay, cool. So to summarize,

1065
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:21,920
having small energy implies that the

1066
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:26,240
subset is large, but it's stronger than

1067
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:28,319
that and it also implies that um that pi

1068
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,200
1 of x is large for all substantial

1069
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:32,799
subsets of a cross b.

1070
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:37,240
So it's stronger in a way which is

1071
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:37,240
exactly what we need in our discussion.

1072
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,960
Okay,

1073
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:45,839
so that suggests

1074
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:49,640
a better version of theorem one that we

1075
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:49,640
could have tried to prove.

1076
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,400
Um, let's erase this lema.

1077
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:01,680
So remember theorem one said that if we

1078
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:05,040
take the projection of a cross a in many

1079
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:07,760
directions, one of them has a large

1080
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:09,359
cardality.

1081
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,200
But we could have proved could have

1082
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:13,359
tried to prove something stronger that

1083
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,039
one of them has a small energy. Let me

1084
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:17,119
write it down. It's true and it's a

1085
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:19,359
theorem.

1086
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:21,359
Theorem two

1087
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:24,359
says

1088
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:24,359
um

1089
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:33,839
right so if a is a subset of fp size of

1090
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:36,160
a is p to the s a z less than s a less

1091
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:41,200
than one

1092
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:44,000
d is in fp size of d is p to the s d 0 z

1093
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,160
is less than sd

1094
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,079
then

1095
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:51,119
um I'm going to consider all the

1096
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:54,640
directions and pick the best one. And

1097
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:57,119
instead of looking at at the size of a

1098
01:03:54,640 --> 01:04:00,240
plus ta, I'm going to look at the energy

1099
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:02,400
of a comma ta.

1100
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,480
And I'll take the minimum over all the

1101
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,799
t.

1102
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:10,960
Okay. So the biggest this energy could

1103
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:13,440
be is p to the 3 sa. It's the maximum

1104
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,799
possible energy.

1105
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,760
And we're going to say it's a little bit

1106
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,760
better than this.

1107
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,599
Okay.

1108
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:38,000
Now because of this lema we

1109
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:41,359
automatically get not only a lower bound

1110
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,680
on pi t of a cross a but we get a lower

1111
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:45,760
bound on pi t of any big subset of a

1112
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:50,200
cross a. So this would automatically

1113
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:50,200
gives the BKT theorem.

1114
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:57,440
So in fact this easily implies a strong

1115
01:04:53,920 --> 01:05:00,400
version of the BKT theorem which I think

1116
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:02,799
was also proven by BKT.

1117
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,920
And it says

1118
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:10,039
that um

1119
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,039
uh so

1120
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:21,440
x is p to the sx and d is as above.

1121
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:27,799
So not only you can say

1122
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:27,799
the maximum t and d pi t of x is large.

1123
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:34,640
So this so that that's the regular

1124
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,960
theorem

1125
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:39,359
and this follows from theorem two and

1126
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:45,520
using our lama

1127
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:48,799
but we could say that um uh

1128
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:51,799
that there so this is true but even

1129
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,799
better

1130
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:57,599
there is some t and d so that

1131
01:05:56,230 --> 01:06:02,640
[Applause]

1132
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:06,079
if y so if y is a subset of x and it's a

1133
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:09,119
substantial subset of x.

1134
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:14,599
Um then

1135
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:14,599
uh pi t of y is big.

1136
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:25,359
Okay. So the proof from here to here is

1137
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:29,119
you know we observed earlier that uh we

1138
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:31,680
can reduce to the case

1139
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:33,440
wow. Okay.

1140
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:35,119
Yeah, I guess I should say using ball

1141
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:38,799
ready gowers, we could reduce to the

1142
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:42,000
case where x is a big subset of a cross

1143
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:44,079
a and then y is a big subset of x. So y

1144
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:48,640
is a big subset of a cross a and then

1145
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:51,359
you use the energy bound to get this.

1146
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:54,720
Okay.

1147
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:59,920
Um so let me say

1148
01:06:54,720 --> 01:07:04,599
proof of theorem 2 plus bkt2

1149
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,599
are similar to what we did in class

1150
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:13,680
and so they could be they're good

1151
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:16,720
optional exercises uh or they could be

1152
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:19,119
some some pieces of it might be required

1153
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,119
exercises.

1154
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,160
Okay. Um,

1155
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:30,559
cool. And I thought I should mention

1156
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,920
this. One of the things that Pablo

1157
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:35,200
impressed on me when we were talking

1158
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:38,400
over the vacation week was that

1159
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:40,319
this slightly stronger version is is is

1160
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:42,000
very is important in applications. Most

1161
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:43,680
of the applications actually depend on

1162
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,680
being able to say this slightly stronger

1163
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,680
thing.

1164
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,680
Okay.

1165
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:59,520
Okay. So now you might think you might

1166
01:07:55,839 --> 01:08:02,160
ask yourself um

1167
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:05,039
maybe energy is actually a better thing

1168
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:07,200
to be talking about because a bound for

1169
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:10,839
the energy is is kind of stable under

1170
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,839
taking large subsets.

1171
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:15,680
And so maybe we should have been talking

1172
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:18,319
about energy all along.

1173
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:20,080
And it's reasonable to ask if you take

1174
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:21,839
our proof of theorem one and you just

1175
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:24,400
try to change all the cardalities to

1176
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:28,600
energies, could you adapt it and prove

1177
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,600
theorem two instead?

1178
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:34,880
Okay. And you you can't do that. Um and

1179
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:38,799
it's a good moment to recap the main

1180
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:40,880
idea in theorem one and also sort of uh

1181
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:42,480
a way of reflecting on the different big

1182
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,480
tools and how they're related to each

1183
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,480
other.

1184
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:56,199
All right. What should I erase?

1185
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:56,199
Maybe now I can erase the BSG theorem.

1186
01:08:56,430 --> 01:09:00,120
[Applause]

1187
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,799
Um,

1188
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:04,719
[Applause]

1189
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:06,000
okay. Actually, before I erase the BSG

1190
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:08,719
theorem, let me make a little comment

1191
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,480
about it. So, it's of it's there are a

1192
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,480
couple of closely related forms of the

1193
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:15,679
theorem. And another way I often say it

1194
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:18,159
is that if the energy of AB is large

1195
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:20,400
then there must be A prime and B prime

1196
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:23,799
so that the cardality of A prime plus B

1197
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,799
prime is small

1198
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:33,319
maybe I should yeah

1199
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:33,319
maybe I should me put it here.

1200
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:44,400
So theorem the SG variant

1201
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:46,560
this is the the way it's most commonly

1202
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:51,520
said so I would be a bit remiss not to

1203
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:53,279
show it to you. So if A and B are in the

1204
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,000
group

1205
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:57,600
and let's say A and B have size at most

1206
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,120
N

1207
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:05,600
and the energy of AB is large

1208
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:08,640
um energy of AB is greater than K

1209
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:11,520
inverse N cubed

1210
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,360
then it may not be the case that a plus

1211
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:16,560
b is small because of the example with

1212
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:18,640
garbage but we can get rid of the

1213
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:23,920
garbage. So there exists a prime in a

1214
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:27,120
and b prime in b so that um

1215
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:31,120
uh a prime

1216
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:35,199
a yeah so that they are substantial. Um

1217
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:39,520
so a prime and b prime are greater than

1218
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:41,199
or equal to k to the minus order of 1 n

1219
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:44,159
and

1220
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:47,280
a prime + b prime is less than or equal

1221
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:49,360
to k to the order of 1.

1222
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:51,199
So if we there's we can locate the

1223
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:53,600
correct structured parts then their

1224
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:56,600
subset is small after we remove some

1225
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,600
garbage.

1226
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:06,400
Okay.

1227
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:09,520
[Applause]

1228
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:11,920
All right. So now let me remind you of

1229
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:15,320
one of the key ideas in the proof of

1230
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,320
theorem one.

1231
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:28,400
key idea

1232
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:30,719
in the proof of theorem one.

1233
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:33,760
So the key idea was based on the plume

1234
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:38,760
corusia inequality and it was an idea

1235
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,760
that I called contagious structure.

1236
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:48,480
So it said if a + t1 a is small

1237
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:52,480
and

1238
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:54,239
a + t2 a is small

1239
01:11:52,480 --> 01:12:00,320
then

1240
01:11:54,239 --> 01:12:02,640
a + t1 + t2 a is also small.

1241
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:05,640
Not quite as small but still pretty

1242
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,640
small.

1243
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:14,560
So this was the key thing.

1244
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:17,600
If um a plus a if a plus ta is small for

1245
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:19,679
a bunch of t and d then it would have to

1246
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,640
be small for an even bigger set of d by

1247
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:24,560
adding d or by multiplying d or by

1248
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,800
taking negatives and then there would be

1249
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,120
a huge set of t's where a plus ta was

1250
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,040
small and then that contradicts basic

1251
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:35,040
double counting.

1252
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:38,239
That's the proof. Okay. So what if we

1253
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:41,440
tried to work with energy throughout? So

1254
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:43,840
instead of trying to prove that a plus

1255
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:46,960
ta is big, we're going to try to prove

1256
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:48,480
that the energy is small.

1257
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,040
So we're doing a proof by contradiction.

1258
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:54,960
So the the analogous question would be

1259
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:56,560
if the energy between a and t1 of a is

1260
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:00,320
large

1261
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:02,080
and the energy between a and t2 of a is

1262
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:05,520
large.

1263
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:12,600
Then does that imply that the energy

1264
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:12,600
between A and T1 + T2 A is large.

1265
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:28,239
Okay, the answer is no. uh and it is the

1266
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:31,199
same issue that we saw before that when

1267
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:33,199
the we say the energy is large it means

1268
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:35,600
there's at least a piece of A and a

1269
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:37,600
piece of T1A that are very friendly with

1270
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:41,199
each other but it doesn't have to be all

1271
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:45,040
of them. So one piece of A must be very

1272
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:48,080
friendly with T1 A and one piece of A

1273
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:49,920
must be very friendly with T2A.

1274
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:52,640
But those could be two different pieces

1275
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:55,199
of A. And in that case we can't really

1276
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,800
learn anything more. Doesn't mean

1277
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:58,960
there's any piece of A that's friendly

1278
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:02,719
with both of them.

1279
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:05,920
So here's the example. Answer is no.

1280
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:09,360
Here's the example. So a might be the

1281
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:12,560
numbers up to n union t1 times the

1282
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:15,120
numbers up to n union t2 * the numbers

1283
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,640
up to

1284
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:21,360
okay

1285
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:25,600
so then uh t1 a be t1 numbers up to n

1286
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:28,880
union dot dot dot t2 a this t2 numbers

1287
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:32,800
up to n union dot dot dot.

1288
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:34,159
So these two guys are very friendly. Not

1289
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,840
just because they're the same as each

1290
01:14:34,159 --> 01:14:38,320
other. Not everybody who's the same as

1291
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:40,080
each other is friends, but because they

1292
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,000
have uh they're have a lot of additive

1293
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:44,320
structure.

1294
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,600
And therefore

1295
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:49,840
this guy is large.

1296
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:54,719
And

1297
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:59,280
uh these two guys are very friendly

1298
01:14:54,719 --> 01:15:03,280
and therefore this guy is large.

1299
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:05,600
But there's nothing going on with T1

1300
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:08,560
plus T1 and T2 are totally arbitrary and

1301
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:11,800
T1 plus T2 we would not typically have

1302
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,800
this large.

1303
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,800
So

1304
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:24,520
all right

1305
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:24,520
if a T1 + T2 a is typically small.

1306
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:30,560
Okay,

1307
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:34,159
cool. So, it was actually kind of

1308
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:36,560
crucial in our proof of theorem one to

1309
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:39,040
talk about the cardality of the subset

1310
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,719
instead of the energy because in that

1311
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:43,120
setting we have the Pluna Roua

1312
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:45,360
inequalities and we get a great deal of

1313
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:48,480
structure from a single subset being

1314
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:51,760
small. We get lots of other things.

1315
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:54,640
On the other hand, it is nice eventually

1316
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:57,199
to get to theorem two because theorem

1317
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,760
two is stable if you replace the actual

1318
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:02,080
product a cross a by a subset which is

1319
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:05,199
almost all of it.

1320
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,960
So energy so so both so both looking at

1321
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:09,199
cardality and looking at energy has it

1322
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,760
have have good features. Energy

1323
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:14,080
estimates are stable undertaking subsets

1324
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:16,400
and the cardality estimates have this

1325
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:18,719
contagious structure thing. Those are

1326
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:21,920
both very helpful.

1327
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:27,199
And so um

1328
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:29,199
uh okay and um and bal

1329
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:31,360
this is important

1330
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:33,760
because

1331
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,600
uh okay even though having a big energy

1332
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:38,080
is not synonymous with having a small

1333
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,400
subset balm gar says they're very

1334
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:42,719
closely related and so by using balag

1335
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:45,280
samuris you can often get the best of

1336
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:47,360
both world worlds so if you were to

1337
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:50,239
pretend that you could have all the good

1338
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:52,080
features of of an energy bound and all

1339
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:54,239
the good features of a cardality bound.

1340
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,920
See what you could prove. Very often you

1341
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:58,159
can prove those things by using

1342
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:01,159
balacrated gowers to move back and

1343
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:01,159
forth.

1344
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:08,000
And Pablo gave the analysis seminar a

1345
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:10,239
few weeks ago and he gave an overview of

1346
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,440
recent developments in projection theory

1347
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:15,199
and he made the claim or suggestion that

1348
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:17,920
this theorem might be one of the most

1349
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:20,320
important or most used theorems in math

1350
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:24,080
in the last several decades.

1351
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:26,880
It was a It was a little provocative.

1352
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:29,679
I thought it was interesting. Uh and I

1353
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:32,080
have gradually been appreciating it uh

1354
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,840
more and more. I'm learning about it. Uh

1355
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:37,199
anyway, I would gradually appreciating

1356
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,800
it more and more. Um and um yeah,

1357
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:43,080
probably as we keep going, we'll see how

1358
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:43,080
this keeps being important.
