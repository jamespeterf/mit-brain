1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,720
Okay. Um, so today we're going to talk

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,279
about the the large civ. So la last week

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,680
we introduced the large civ and we

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,199
explained how it's kind of analogous to

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,480
um the projections theorems that we

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,760
proved in finite fields and the

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,400
projection theorems that we proved in

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,760
uklidian space. Um and today I wanted to

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,880
explain to you some of the applications

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,559
of the large civ in in number theory. Um

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,440
so the original application of the large

12
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,600
civ uh was was by Lynn and he was

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,719
interested in how quadratic residues are

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,320
distributed and um I wrote that one up

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,719
on the homework. So the homework problem

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,399
is to re retrace Linux steps proving

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,920
about how quadratic residues are

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,640
distributed.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,960
Um and then a second um uh important

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,280
influential application has to do with

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,680
how prime numbers are distributed modulo

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,400
q. Um so that so that's what I'm going

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,720
to tell you all about today.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,840
Um okay so first we'll do some

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,840
background of uh I'll talk about uh

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,680
first we'll talk about um what is known

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,240
about how prime numbers are distributed

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,240
modulo q

29
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,499
[Music]

30
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,989
[Applause]

31
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:48,680
All right. So let's say pi of n is the

32
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,680
number of primes up to n.

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,200
Okay. And then we can look at the modulo

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,640
Q for some choice Q and see how many of

35
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:08,000
those primes are in each moduli class.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:12,720
So pi n q a

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,319
is the number of p prime

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,319
p less than or equal to n and p= a mod

39
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,319
q.

40
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,640
Okay. Now um some of these moduli

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,599
classes will be quite some of these will

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,680
be quite small. um like if a and q have

43
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,680
a common factor then there will be only

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,560
finitely many primes in this moduli

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:42,080
class. So the the main focus is on the

46
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:45,440
ones where the gcd of a and q is one. So

47
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,680
focus on my case. Um

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,239
uh so I'm going to write it that A is in

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:57,959
ZQ star. ZQ star is the set of A and Z

50
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,959
mod Q where A is relatively prime to Q.

51
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,720
Okay. Um

52
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,800
so numerically and theoretically it

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,879
looks like the primes are pretty evenly

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,640
distributed among all of these residue

55
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:17,040
classes and it um is relevant to say how

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,519
many there are. So that's called fe of q

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,760
the cardality of zqst star the number of

58
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,920
different a that are relatively prime to

59
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,080
q. Um okay so if the primes were really

60
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,440
well evenly distributed among the moduli

61
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,200
classes then you would expect uh so I'll

62
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,200
write this way so we see even

63
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,200
distribution

64
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:44,799
and that means that the actual number of

65
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:47,599
primes in the moduli class is close to

66
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,959
the total number of primes divided by

67
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,959
the number of moduli classes.

68
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,879
Okay.

69
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:03,200
So how would we measure this precisely?

70
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:06,080
We define delta Q of N the sort of

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,080
defect of equidistribution to be the

72
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,000
maximum over all the residue classes of

73
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,840
the difference between the actual number

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,959
of primes

75
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,959
and this naive estimate.

76
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,280
Okay. All right. So when we ask um you

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,680
know how how evenly are primes

78
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,960
distributed modulo Q quantitatively that

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,960
means how big is this thing?

80
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,479
Okay. So this question was first

81
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,160
addressed by Dirishlay who showed that

82
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:44,680
in a certain sense uh that this is close

83
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,680
to this. Here's what he proved.

84
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,639
um he proved that for any Q if you take

85
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:00,639
the limit as n goes to infinity of um

86
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,840
delta q of n it's sort of asmintoically

87
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,840
smaller than n / q. So this limit is

88
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,840
zero.

89
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,120
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So actually let me say

90
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,039
we talk about these being

91
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,360
equidistributed we're going to mean that

92
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:20,639
this is small relative to what? Um well

93
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,440
um you know this is a good approximation

94
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,160
of this if this error term is small

95
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,280
compared to the main term.

96
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,280
So uh so equidistribution

97
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,400
would mean that uh delta q of n is much

98
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,360
smaller than the main term which is on

99
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,360
the order of n / q

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,759
or n over maybe n over log n.

101
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,479
Okay.

102
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,199
Um so durishlay's arguments you can make

103
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,880
them quantitative. um instead of having

104
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,600
a limit you could say if n is

105
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,560
sufficiently big um and they were made

106
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,600
quantitative by Zagel and Walfish which

107
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,600
involves some additional ideas

108
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:16,880
and so this line of thinking led to the

109
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:20,720
following theorem. Um so uh so for any q

110
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:24,080
delta q of n is bounded by okay so let

111
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,360
me say it this way so so for any a

112
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:31,759
there's a constant c sub a and delta q

113
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:36,680
of n is bounded by c sub a n

114
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,680
log of n to the minus a.

115
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,520
Okay. Now, when is this useful? When

116
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,880
does this tell us that delta q of n is

117
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:51,520
is much smaller than n over q? Well, q

118
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:55,360
cannot be too big. So, uh so delta qn is

119
00:06:51,520 --> 00:07:00,360
much smaller than n / q if

120
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,360
q is smaller than a power of log n.

121
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,240
Okay. So I'm not going to talk about the

122
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,720
proofs of these theorems in in the

123
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,680
class. Uh dear so Durishlay invented L

124
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,440
functions. You may have heard of

125
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,520
Dirishlay L functions in in order to

126
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,400
prove this theorem. And all of this work

127
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:25,440
is based on L functions. Um

128
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:28,240
okay. Okay. Um so that those are

129
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,240
those are nice theorems but they only

130
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,160
work when Q is pretty small compared to

131
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,479
N. Um what happens if if Q is bigger?

132
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,880
Well um experimentally what seems to

133
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,759
happen is the following. This is

134
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,759
conjectured by Montgomery.

135
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:51,520
Um so for every epsilon bigger than zero

136
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,160
delta q of n is bounded by cepsilon n to

137
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:59,879
the epsilon it's like a fudge factor and

138
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,879
then there's n / q to the 12.

139
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,120
So this is a pseudo random behavior. So,

140
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,840
so a good reference point you know

141
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,360
sometimes people ask like sort of do are

142
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,199
primes distributed do they does it look

143
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,440
random the way primes are distributed.

144
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,000
So a good reference point is um there

145
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,240
are about n over log n primes up to n.

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,800
So instead pick n over log n random

147
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,879
numbers reduce the mod q and see what

148
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
happens. So this is what you would see

149
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:29,400
if you had random numbers. So this is

150
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,400
sort of a pseudo random conjecture.

151
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,159
Okay. So this is much stronger than we

152
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,360
could prove. Um and it implies

153
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,200
incidentally that delta q of n is much

154
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,360
smaller than n / q. So we have some

155
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,839
pretty good expert distribution as long

156
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,519
as q is smaller than n^ the 1 minus

157
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,040
epsilon.

158
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,160
So there is a a huge gap between this

159
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,680
and this.

160
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,680
All right. Um

161
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,240
so this result I think was proven in the

162
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,040
1930s and it is still today the best

163
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,120
result of its kind. So we cannot

164
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,640
increase this to say n to the n to the

165
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,440
epsilon.

166
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,240
Um uh if we are willing to assume the

167
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,440
remon hypothesis or something that the

168
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,440
generalized remon hypothesis then we get

169
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,120
much stronger information although still

170
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,480
not this conjecture. So it says for

171
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,000
every epsilon bigger than zero delta q

172
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,760
of n is bounded by cepsilon n to the

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,640
epsilon*

174
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,360
n^ the 12 looks sort of like this but

175
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,680
with no q in the denominator

176
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,800
and that's good enough to imply that we

177
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:44,080
get some some amount of equistribution

178
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,399
if q is smaller than n half minus

179
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,399
epsilon

180
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,560
Okay,

181
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,240
so it gives some idea of how difficult

182
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,000
this conjecture is that even with the

183
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,320
remon hypothesis, we're sort of only

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,320
halfway there.

185
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,600
Okay. Um, so this is everything that is

186
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,880
known if you want to have a theorem that

187
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,279
definitely works for a particular Q and

188
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,680
having

189
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,839
run into a barrier there that's has been

190
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,160
difficult to overcome. Uh people started

191
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,000
to think about well maybe we won't prove

192
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,720
a theorem for every single Q but we

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,800
could prove a theorem for most of them.

194
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,560
So that's the the main topic of the

195
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:37,440
class today. So theorems for most Q.

196
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,560
All right. So this theorem

197
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,279
uh I'm going I want to credit Reni and

198
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,279
Bombi Venogra.

199
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,800
I I read about the history yesterday. So

200
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,200
this is usually called the Bombi

201
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,200
Venogradov theorem. Um the first person

202
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,279
to prove a theorem of this flavor seems

203
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
to be Reni and then various people

204
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,480
improved the parameters in the theorem

205
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,160
building up to Bombi and Vograov.

206
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,160
All right. So it says the following

207
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,120
thing for every epsilon bigger than

208
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,040
zero. Um

209
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,600
and

210
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:18,800
okay so if I take the sum on Q up to N

211
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:23,040
to the 12 minus epsilon

212
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:26,839
of delta Q of N.

213
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,839
Check the exact phrasing.

214
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,839
Um

215
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,839
A then this is bounded by

216
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,520
constant depending on epsilon and a n

217
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,720
log of n^ the minus a.

218
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,720
[Applause]

219
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,240
Okay, so let's digest this a little bit.

220
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,200
So the job of epsilon is that we can

221
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,880
almost go up to n to the 1/2 but not

222
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,399
quite.

223
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:08,399
And then um the job of a is that um

224
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:14,000
uh so so okay so this so this tells us

225
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:17,760
that for most not all but most uh of the

226
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,959
q up to n to the half minus epsilon

227
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,320
delta q of n is bounded by well I divide

228
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:28,800
both sides by the number of terms um and

229
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,920
so it would be I could put here um n / Q

230
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,560
log of N to the minus A. So which is

231
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,000
indeed much smaller than N Q. So

232
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:43,399
informally for most Q we get good

233
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,399
equidistribution of the primes modulo Q.

234
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,200
Okay. And um

235
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,120
and it so happens that the height of the

236
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,519
the size of the cues we can get up to

237
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,040
here matches the size of the cues you

238
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,120
can get up to if you knew the remon

239
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,079
hypothesis. Um and so this is sometimes

240
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,600
summarized as being like it's definitely

241
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,120
not as good as the remon hypothesis, but

242
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,560
it's sort of for most for most version

243
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,560
of what you would learn from the Remont

244
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
hypothesis.

245
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,839
Okay, good.

246
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,240
Okay. Um, so my goal today is to tell

247
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,839
you the ideas of the proof of this

248
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,519
theorem. There are certain things that

249
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,959
are a bit messy and I won't do all of

250
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,600
the messy things, so we won't do a

251
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,440
complete proof. Um, but I'd like to

252
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,880
address a couple questions like what

253
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,519
does this have to do with civs and

254
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,959
projection theory? And um, another

255
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,639
question, what does it have to do with

256
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,880
primes or how will we use that they're

257
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,079
they're primes?

258
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,199
Okay. Um,

259
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,760
right. Okay. So,

260
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,639
it um, since we're only trying to prove

261
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,560
things for most Q, we're sort of looking

262
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,760
at all of the different Q's. So we have

263
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,760
one set of primes and we're projecting

264
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,199
at modulo Q for lots of different Q's.

265
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,880
So that's the setting of projection

266
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,120
theory where we can bring in things like

267
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:23,399
the large civ.

268
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,399
Um so I wanted to recall

269
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,959
that the so the large civ um allows us

270
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,199
to prove the following kind of thing. So

271
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:37,440
we have the set x contained in the

272
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:42,880
integers up to n and I look at pi p of 1

273
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:47,680
x and I'll take the high part of that

274
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:51,680
and then this thing is small

275
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:55,880
for most uh p

276
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,880
and pm. So this PM

277
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,959
put it. Okay. Yeah. So PM

278
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,519
is the set of P prime

279
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,519
P around M.

280
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay. So this looks on the surface like

281
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,040
a similar sort of thing. We have a set

282
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,639
X. We project it modulo P for many

283
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,079
different primes P and we throw out the

284
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,399
constant part and just look at the

285
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,079
variation from being constant. And this

286
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,079
is saying that this projection is pretty

287
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,440
evenly distributed

288
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,279
for most of the primes.

289
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,040
So it sounds similar to this and indeed

290
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:38,480
this will be crucially relevant. Um

291
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,399
now this is a statement about every set

292
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,839
X

293
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,920
in particular. You could put the primes

294
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,199
here. So you got a theorem about primes.

295
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,360
Um but it's true for for every set. Um

296
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,680
this theorem is definitely not true for

297
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,800
every set.

298
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,600
So I make a remark

299
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,240
that the the theorem

300
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,800
is not true

301
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,720
if you replace

302
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,040
um the primes

303
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,040
by just some set x of numbers up to n

304
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,040
with maybe roughly the same size as the

305
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,040
primes.

306
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:23,160
Um okay so there's a simple example but

307
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,160
I think it's instructive to see.

308
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,639
So the example is like this. I'm going

309
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,279
to try to build a set where I can reduce

310
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,320
it modulo every prime and whichever

311
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,040
prime I reduce it by I will see one

312
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,680
moduli class which is extremely over

313
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,519
represented. So here's how we build such

314
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,720
a set. So for every p in primes of size

315
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,920
around m is just a free parameter here.

316
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Um I choose some a

317
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,839
and z mod p

318
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,720
and then I'll make my set x is going to

319
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:04,240
be the union over all the primes

320
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:09,160
and then I take um the set of n up to n

321
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,160
so that n is equal to a mod p.

322
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,319
So for each prime I pick a moduli class.

323
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,280
I take all the integers in that moduli

324
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:21,160
class and I take a union over all the

325
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,160
primes in my set of primes.

326
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:29,760
Okay.

327
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:33,360
So if I were to take pi p 1x of a

328
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,679
well uh x contains all the integers in

329
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,640
this moduli class up to n. So this is

330
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,640
basically n over p which is around n /

331
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,640
m.

332
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,960
Um and that's much bigger than average.

333
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,559
If I if I if I the average would be the

334
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,600
size of yes actually let's figure out

335
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:59,520
the size of x. So the size of x is at

336
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:03,919
most um there will be about n over m um

337
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:07,440
numbers in this moduli class. Um and

338
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,960
then there are about m over log m

339
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,840
primes.

340
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,840
So something like this.

341
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,880
So this is you know a smalish fraction.

342
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,840
It's much less than all of them. Um so

343
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,840
this is way smaller than the size of x

344
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,919
over p.

345
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:33,080
So this guy is seriously over

346
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,080
represented and it happens for every P.

347
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,760
Okay.

348
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,559
Okay. Great. So

349
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,320
so this theorem is we'll see the large

350
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,240
civ is absolutely crucial thing in the

351
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,080
proof. It's the main idea. But this is

352
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,120
not a theorem about arbitrary sets. It's

353
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,440
a theorem about prime numbers. And so

354
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,720
the proof needs to use something about

355
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,720
prime numbers.

356
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,000
Okay,

357
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:05,120
cool. Um, okay. So, um, so the main

358
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,600
character is a concept called

359
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,840
multiplicative convolution.

360
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,520
And I think this is a nice concept to

361
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,679
know about. It's a cousin of regular

362
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,679
additive convolution. And I'll try to uh

363
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,960
we we'll see that it interacts with all

364
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,200
the things in our story. So

365
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,679
multiplicative convolution interacts

366
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,280
really nicely with prime numbers

367
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,000
describing what are prime numbers. It

368
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,240
sort of comes up naturally u and it also

369
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,840
interacts nicely with taking projections

370
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,840
and so it interacts nicely with the

371
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,760
large civ and fitting all those things

372
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,160
together is the is how we prove this

373
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,160
thing.

374
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,160
Okay.

375
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,799
Okay. So what is multiplicative

376
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,799
convolution?

377
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:04,799
All right. Um, so suppose f and g are

378
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,280
functions on the natural numbers.

379
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,039
If I take the multiplicative convolution

380
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,080
of them,

381
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:16,640
it means I add up over all the pairs n1

382
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:21,559
and n2 whose product is n and then I

383
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,559
take f of n1 g of n2.

384
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,880
So let's compare that with regular

385
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,600
convolution. So regular convolution say

386
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,360
on the integers would be the same thing

387
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,200
but I would have the sum over all the

388
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,799
pairs n1 n2 who add up to n and the

389
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,600
multiplicative version is we replace the

390
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,600
sum here by a product.

391
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,840
Okay so that's multiplicative

392
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,840
convolution.

393
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,840
Okay.

394
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:58,880
Okay. So, so we have to see um how

395
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,440
multiplicative convolution connects with

396
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,720
primes

397
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,640
and we have to see how multiplicative

398
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,480
convolution interacts with projections.

399
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,919
[Applause]

400
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,559
We'll put that together and that's how

401
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:18,840
we prove the the thing.

402
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,840
Okay, so let's start with primes.

403
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:35,919
Okay. So, um you know the the large civ

404
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:40,240
inequality um we use this word civ and

405
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:43,039
uh I will explain to you now what what

406
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,799
does where does the word civ come from

407
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,039
and it comes out naturally when you

408
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,039
think about primes.

409
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,039
Um,

410
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,200
okay.

411
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,640
So, um, so how would how do you find the

412
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,480
prime numbers? Suppose I wanted to make

413
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,159
a list of prime numbers up to n. What

414
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,400
what would I do? I would start with all

415
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,640
the natural numbers. Then I cross off

416
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,559
the multiples of two. Then I cross off

417
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,559
the multiples of three and so on. And

418
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:20,159
then what's left are the prime numbers.

419
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,679
Um, so that process is called siving.

420
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,679
Um,

421
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,600
I think siving physically is where you

422
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,919
take like

423
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,679
a a thing full of sand and somewhere in

424
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,440
there has a little gold or diamond or

425
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,880
something and you shake this thing and

426
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,960
the sand falls out until eventually

427
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,799
you're just left with the diamonds. So

428
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,640
the image is you have a thing full of

429
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,159
sand which are all the natural numbers

430
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,440
and you shake it and you take out the

431
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,480
multiples of two and the multiples of

432
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,559
three or whatever and then eventually

433
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,640
you just have the prime numbers left. as

434
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,400
the image.

435
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,159
All right.

436
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,559
Um

437
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:53,559
Okay. So

438
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,400
to find the primes,

439
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,559
we start with the natural numbers.

440
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,799
Then we

441
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:10,000
cross out

442
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:13,360
multiples of two. Then we cross out

443
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,440
multiples of three and dot dot. All

444
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,440
right. Okay. So, we can all imagine

445
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,600
that. Now, let's try to describe this

446
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,440
process using formulas. And we'll see

447
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,679
that the formulas that naturally appear

448
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,600
are formulas involving multiplicative

449
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,919
convolution.

450
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,520
Okay. So, I'm going to write one of n to

451
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,640
be the characteristic function of all

452
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,720
the natural numbers.

453
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,280
And then the next character I'm going to

454
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,280
put is a function called difference

455
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,280
subp.

456
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:53,240
So it's one if n= 1 and it's -1 if n is

457
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,240
p and it's zero otherwise.

458
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,919
Okay. Now let's think what would happen

459
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,000
if I took all the natural numbers and I

460
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,000
did a multiplicative convolution with

461
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
d2.

462
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,240
So this would give me so d2 has sort of

463
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,520
a delta positive delta function at one

464
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,720
and a negative delta function at two. So

465
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,000
when I do this I'm going to get

466
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,559
characteristic function of all the

467
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,039
natural numbers coming from this one

468
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,200
minus the characteristic function of two

469
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,440
times the natural numbers coming from

470
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,440
that one.

471
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,200
Pause there. Does that does that make

472
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,320
sense? Does that fit with the you know

473
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,279
plugging in the definition of

474
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,679
multiplicative convolution?

475
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,440
Let's do it slowly to be sure. So what's

476
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:51,919
the definition?

477
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:56,559
One convolved with d2 of n is the sum n1

478
00:24:51,919 --> 00:25:01,559
n2 = n of 1 of n1

479
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,559
times d2 of n2.

480
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:08,080
All right. Now d2 is only non- vanishing

481
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,799
in two cases. So we actually only have

482
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:16,559
to consider that n2 is 1 or n2 is 2.

483
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:22,240
So um the one is always there.

484
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:26,640
So that is 1 of n * d2 of 1.

485
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,960
And then uh if d is even

486
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,279
so so this is what happens if if n is

487
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,840
odd.

488
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:39,200
Um and then if n is even

489
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:42,240
then n2 could be two. So we get one of n

490
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:46,640
one of n / two sorry we get we get the

491
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:52,000
um so this is with cases one of n d2 of

492
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:54,480
1 minus one of plus one of n / 2 d2 of

493
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,279
2.

494
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,440
So this is just one and this is 1 minus

495
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,200
one which is zero. So we're left with

496
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,600
the characteristic function of the odd

497
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,919
numbers.

498
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,279
Okay, let's go one further. If I take

499
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,600
the characteristic function of the

500
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,760
naturals, I do a multiplicative

501
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,679
convolution with D2. Then I do a

502
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,919
multiplicative convolution with D3.

503
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,760
What happens? Well, this one gives me

504
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:25,000
the characteristic function of the odd

505
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,000
numbers and then I'm convolving with D3.

506
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Now what happens? I get the

507
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,520
characteristic function of the odd

508
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,559
numbers minus the characteristic

509
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,120
function of three times the odd numbers

510
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,120
when I do this.

511
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,360
So I have the odd numbers but now I'm

512
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,559
going to cross out the ones that are

513
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:52,080
multiples of three. And so this is the

514
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:55,120
characteristic function of um n is

515
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:59,480
relatively prime

516
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,480
to two and three.

517
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,679
Okay. So this shows by example that this

518
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,360
process starting with the natural

519
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,200
numbers crossing out multiples of two

520
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,159
crossing out multiples of three it

521
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,640
corresponds to convolving by these d's

522
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,640
over and over.

523
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,600
Okay, cool. Okay, so now let me make a

524
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,600
little notation.

525
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,370
[Applause]

526
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,440
All right.

527
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,919
So, we're going to do civ for primes

528
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,919
general version.

529
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,080
All right. So suppose that s is a set of

530
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,080
primes

531
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:05,200
and then rp subs of n that stands for

532
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:10,240
relatively prime to s.

533
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:13,200
This is one if um

534
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,240
P and N are relatively prime for all the

535
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,840
primes in my set. So it's one if if my

536
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,480
number n doesn't have is relatively

537
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,919
prime to everybody else and it's zero

538
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:29,159
otherwise. So it's zero if there exists

539
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,159
a prime in my set that divides out.

540
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,640
Okay.

541
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:40,640
All right. So let's make a remark.

542
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,039
Um so if s is the primes that go up to

543
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,440
the square root of n

544
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:51,279
and little n is um let's say bigger than

545
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,399
the square root of n but at most n

546
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:58,159
then either n has a prime factor from

547
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,799
this list or it is prime.

548
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,720
So in that case

549
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:09,679
our r our r relatively prime s of n is

550
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:11,279
just p of n whether n is prime.

551
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,200
Okay.

552
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,039
So this thing uh if I'm interested in

553
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,840
the primes in a certain range say from n

554
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,520
/2 to n I can detect them using this

555
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,279
function.

556
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,520
And this function we've just seen is a

557
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,720
big convolution.

558
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,399
So lama um

559
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,120
so

560
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:40,399
if if if my set of primes is p1 up to p

561
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:44,080
r then um relatively prime subs of n is

562
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:47,200
one convolved with dp1

563
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:51,080
convolved with dpr. These are all

564
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,080
multiplicative convolutions.

565
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,720
I think

566
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,720
there

567
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:20,640
1 x of a is n / t like why why we need

568
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,679
to count like contributions from like

569
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,840
are the kids.

570
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,159
>> Yeah. Okay. So the question is coming

571
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,960
back to this example. We built a set

572
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,720
whose projections uh projection onto

573
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:38,159
every prime has one place that's really

574
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:40,320
big. Um so um in X is made as a union of

575
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,600
arithmetic progressions.

576
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,120
Um now this X is a set. It's not a

577
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,760
function. So you know these these

578
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,080
arithmetic progressions might overlap

579
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,720
but if they do the point where they

580
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,440
overlap in this formulation only counts

581
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,840
once although that is it's not super

582
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:02,399
important but um so if you look at um pi

583
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,840
p of 1x of a that's how many elements of

584
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:09,360
x are congruent to a mod p

585
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,440
and so so all of them are already

586
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,120
>> and some of the other p might also

587
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,440
contain some of these elements but it

588
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,880
doesn't count anymore. Oh, okay.

589
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,480
>> Though, if it did count anymore, it

590
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,919
would just make this phenomenon even

591
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,919
more extreme than it already is.

592
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,840
Okay, cool. Any other questions or

593
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,840
comments?

594
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,159
All right. All right. So the um so the

595
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,000
characteristic function of the primes is

596
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,919
a special function probably in lots of

597
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,760
ways and the way that's relevant for us

598
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,919
today is that the characteristic

599
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,320
function of the primes is basically this

600
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,679
function which is a big convolution a

601
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,480
big multiplicative convolution and so

602
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:05,519
the bombier venograph theorem is mostly

603
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,120
a theorem about functions that have the

604
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,120
structure that they're they're

605
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,120
convolutions.

606
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,880
Okay, cool.

607
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,080
Okay, so that is how multiplicative

608
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,679
convolution is related to primes. Next,

609
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,279
let's think about how multiplicative

610
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,279
convolution is related to projections.

611
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:34,039
[Applause]

612
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
All

613
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,480
right.

614
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,880
Okay. Um,

615
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,000
so here there are a bunch of a bunch of

616
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,000
different fairly simple lemas.

617
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,039
Okay.

618
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,880
And and all these lemas have the flavor

619
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,360
that doing multiplicative convolution

620
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,000
and doing projections fits together as

621
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,519
well as you could hope. And I I think

622
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
basically the reason for that is that

623
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,519
the projection operation is a ring

624
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,320
homorphism from the ring Z to the ring Z

625
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,919
mod Q. And we'll be talking about

626
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,559
multiplication. So being a ring

627
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,240
homorphism, it means that the projection

628
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,640
uh respects the product operation. And

629
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,720
so the multiplicative convolution is

630
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,919
defined in terms of the product con

631
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:04,640
operation. So it all fits together.

632
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:08,720
Okay. So lema one says that if f and g

633
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:13,760
natural numbers go to c um then

634
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:18,560
if I take the projection of f convolved

635
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:24,679
with g I get the projection of f

636
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,679
convolved with the projection of g.

637
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,599
Okay, I guess this one requires a

638
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,320
definition.

639
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,919
um if I had been savvy in general I

640
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,800
might have defined multiplicative

641
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:38,639
convolution in the first place for any

642
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,679
multiplicative

643
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,520
I don't monoate or something um but

644
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:48,399
anyway let's just say what it is for Z

645
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:53,040
mod Q is it is what we think um

646
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:57,839
okay so um so if I have maybe capital F

647
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:59,920
and capital G functions on Z mod Q

648
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,800
Then

649
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,640
multiplicative convolution of a class A

650
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:11,359
is the sum over all pairs A1 A2 that

651
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:16,839
multiply to A of capital F of A capital

652
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,839
G capital F of A1 capital G of A2.

653
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,040
Okay.

654
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,119
So this is the first lema

655
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,320
and the proof idea is you just start on

656
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,720
either side and write down the

657
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,480
definition and unwind everything and you

658
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,720
use the fact that that um reduction mod

659
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,720
q is a ring homorphism and it all fits

660
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,720
together.

661
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,359
Okay. So I think that my saying that is

662
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,720
clearer than if I were to write it out.

663
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:53,280
Yeah. Do you not get like big issues

664
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,599
from double counting them like the left

665
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,079
side because you're supposed to make the

666
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,760
kernelism?

667
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,480
>> Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, this is a

668
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,160
homorphism but with a kernel. Um, let's

669
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,560
write it out and make sure that this is

670
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,640
this actually is okay. Um, I'm going to

671
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,240
put the proofs on this board so that

672
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,680
eventually we'll just have this list of

673
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,680
lemas that will be handy.

674
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,760
Okay.

675
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,320
Um, okay. So, here's how I like to think

676
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:36,960
about the proof. I'm going to think of f

677
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:41,560
as a sum over n1 of a delta function at

678
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,560
n1 weighted by f of n1.

679
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:49,920
And I can do the same with G

680
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,119
sum over n2 delta function of n2 g of 2.

681
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,390
What happens when I take their

682
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,320
convolution?

683
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,480
[Music]

684
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,839
Uh the multiplicative convolution is the

685
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:04,079
sum over n1 and n2. I have a delta

686
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:07,320
function at n1 n2 weighted by f of n1 g

687
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,320
of n2.

688
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,720
Okay, let's check that this is the same

689
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,960
definition as before. So if I want to

690
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:20,320
evaluate this at a point n, um, well,

691
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:23,520
when I evaluate this at n, it only

692
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:27,599
appears if n1 * n2 is n. So I'm summing

693
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:32,359
over pairs n1 * n2 that multiply to n.

694
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,359
I'm summing up f of n1, g of n2.

695
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,240
Does this look okay to people? Let me

696
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,160
let me maybe let me add you know when I

697
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,359
write um

698
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,960
delta n1 that's a function of n and it

699
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,040
means it's one if n is equal to n1 and

700
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,880
it's zero otherwise.

701
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,359
So this this delta function to this

702
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:02,359
delta is a delta function. So f is this

703
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,359
and g is this and f g is this.

704
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:16,480
Okay. Um okay so now what is pi qf of a?

705
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:24,280
It's the sum over n1 of a delta function

706
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:24,280
at n1 mod q of a f of a1.

707
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,160
So I actually so I like the image of f

708
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,240
and g as some kind of density. So we

709
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,880
think of f as like a description of some

710
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,880
stuff and there's f of n1 stuff located

711
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,440
at n1

712
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,960
and same for g. So what does the

713
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,720
projection do? It just takes the stuff

714
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,720
at n1 and it moves it to n1 modulo q.

715
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,079
And stuff is coming to n1 modulo q from

716
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,400
several different places and it just

717
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,560
adds up.

718
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,560
And what does convolution do? It takes

719
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,880
every bit of stuff here and every bit of

720
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,960
stuff here.

721
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,520
It takes a bit that's at n1 here and a

722
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,400
bit that's n2 there. Takes those uh two

723
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,920
bits and it makes a new bit at n1* n2.

724
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,720
And the weight of the new bit is the

725
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,640
product and there may be several new

726
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,359
bits arriving at the same place and we

727
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,880
add them up.

728
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:25,839
Okay, so that's what the projection

729
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:28,880
does. Um okay so now if I take the

730
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:32,400
projection of f convolved with the

731
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:38,800
projection of g at a it's the sum over

732
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:41,040
n1 and n2 the delta function uh uh n1 *

733
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:48,680
n2

734
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:48,680
mod q of a f of n1 g of n2

735
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,800
and then that's the same

736
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:57,800
as um

737
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:08,200
um that's this that so then that's the

738
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:08,200
same as pi q of fval

739
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,079
yeah so all it boils down to is I have

740
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,040
these these this bit of f and this bit

741
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,920
of g and I could first reduce them each

742
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,640
mod q and then multiply them together or

743
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,800
I could first multiply them together and

744
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,119
then reduce mod q and those are the same

745
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,200
as each other because reduction mod q is

746
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,200
a homorph

747
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,280
okay so that's the first step

748
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,960
Okay, second lema says

749
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,480
so eventually we would like some L

750
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,400
infinity bounds. Um but so far in

751
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,880
projection theory we've mostly seen L2

752
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,160
bounds and they're related to each other

753
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:14,800
by basically Koshy Schwarz. Um so it

754
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:17,839
says that if I have f and g on zq

755
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,359
then a multiplicative convolution of

756
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:23,440
them if I take the l infinity norm on zq

757
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,480
star

758
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:30,599
that is bounded by

759
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,599
l2 g2

760
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,200
okay so in lema 2 I think it's important

761
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,359
to put this star here that um

762
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,200
multiplication

763
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,960
um

764
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,880
you know so we leave out zero and and we

765
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,800
leave out things the common factor with

766
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,319
Q if you included zero there are a lot

767
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,680
of ways to have a product that makes

768
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,480
zero and I felt a little worried about

769
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:56,880
how that would go um so that's why we

770
00:41:52,480 --> 00:42:00,079
have this star here let's prove lambda 2

771
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:05,680
proof of lambda 2

772
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:10,319
um so if a is in zq star

773
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:14,160
Then f convolved g of a is going to be

774
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:20,359
the sum b in zq star.

775
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:20,359
f of b g of a b inverse.

776
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,000
Why? Well, we're adding up over pairs

777
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,200
that multiply to a.

778
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,119
And since a is in zqst star, a is

779
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,040
invertible. Each of these has to be

780
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,000
invertible. So b had better also be in

781
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,040
zqst star. And so we get this sum.

782
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:43,720
Okay. And then we use Koshy Schwarz

783
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,720
and we found that by FL2GL2.

784
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:03,520
Okay. Um there's a small technical issue

785
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:05,040
uh about ZQ or ZQ star. So we're going

786
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,200
to like break something up into a

787
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,560
constant part and the other part.

788
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,079
Constant part and the high frequency

789
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,720
part. And it's slightly different

790
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,359
whether you do this on ZQ or ZQ star.

791
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,880
This just a minor technical nuisance. Q

792
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,640
is even usually going to be prime. So

793
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,079
I'm just going to be leaving out zero.

794
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,319
But let me just write a lema that says

795
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:26,079
that this isn't such a big deal. Um so

796
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:28,800
okay, so a little notation. So suppose I

797
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,200
have a function f on ZQ.

798
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:36,839
I might be interested in f just on ZQ

799
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,839
star. So I'm going to call that f star.

800
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:43,680
It's just the just the restriction of f

801
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,520
to

802
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,839
star.

803
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,839
Okay. Now I could split either one of

804
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,760
these up into a constant part plus a

805
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,200
leftover,

806
00:43:51,760 --> 00:44:00,079
but the constants would be slightly

807
00:43:53,200 --> 00:44:05,920
different. So f is f plus f high and f

808
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:10,319
star is f star plus f high star.

809
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:12,240
So fnot and f star are constant and the

810
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:15,839
other pieces have mean zero but in

811
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:20,880
slightly different sense. So if I add up

812
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:23,120
fh of a over z mod q I get zero. But if

813
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,319
I add up

814
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:31,160
[Applause]

815
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:31,160
f* h over zqst star. Okay, I guess.

816
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,960
Okay,

817
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,640
so I felt like I had to say this to be

818
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,560
kind of honest at some point, but it's

819
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,960
not really a big deal. And lema 3 says

820
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:47,599
that the

821
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:50,560
L2 norm of the star part is the uh the

822
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:53,119
high star part is at at most the L2 norm

823
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,839
of the regular high part. So this one

824
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,839
lives on CQ star and this one lives on

825
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:58,839
CQ.

826
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,440
Okay. And then the last lema

827
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:23,839
um says that the high part commutes well

828
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:31,599
with multiplicative convolution.

829
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:33,200
So if fstar and g star are on zqst star

830
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,760
um

831
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,280
then

832
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,200
there's going to be a lot of stars in

833
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,480
this formula.

834
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:47,640
The high part of the convolution

835
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,640
is the convolution of the high parts.

836
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,160
Okay, we could prove all these things if

837
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,000
we feel like it. They're they're not

838
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,760
difficult. Um I think I want to leave it

839
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,920
for now because I've put an excessive

840
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,400
number of details on the board and then

841
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,839
and try to uh step back and have a

842
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,040
bigger picture and then pause and check

843
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,599
it.

844
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:13,240
Okay, so all of these lemas imply the

845
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,240
following proposition.

846
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,479
[Applause]

847
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:35,040
Okay, so maybe I have some convolution,

848
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,760
some multiplicative convolution f

849
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:41,760
and I would like to reduce it mod q for

850
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:45,920
different q's. So I look at it projected

851
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:49,200
mod q and then um I'm only going to be

852
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,800
interested in the star part. So I'm I'm

853
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,079
going to look at the I'm going to

854
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,680
restrict it to zq star and I want to

855
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,400
know whether that's almost constant. So

856
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,839
I'll look at the high part of that and I

857
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,800
want to know that that's small

858
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:05,839
everywhere. This is the kind of estimate

859
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:09,359
that we are asking about in the bombier

860
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:12,400
theorem right because our set our set of

861
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:14,640
primes is morally multiplicative

862
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,040
convolution and I'm taking the set of

863
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,560
primes and reducing it mod q and looking

864
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,440
at the different classes that I have in

865
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,800
zq star and I think that that's going to

866
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,440
be almost constant. So I'm going to

867
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,280
subtract off the constant part and now I

868
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,800
want to know that what's left is very

869
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,000
small everywhere. So that's an L

870
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,520
infinity norm. So the bombierograph

871
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,480
theorem is about estimating this kind of

872
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:41,119
thing and the proposition says that that

873
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:45,599
is smaller than um

874
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:51,920
pi q of f high l2

875
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:54,920
piq of g high pi oops piq of g high and

876
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,920
l2.

877
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,599
Okay. And it's just it's assembling a

878
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:06,240
bunch of those lemas.

879
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:09,040
So um

880
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:12,480
so the projection of the convolution

881
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:15,480
high part is the

882
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,480
so

883
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,520
proof uh of proposition

884
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:26,960
have the

885
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:29,520
projection of the convolution

886
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,319
restrict it take the high part this is

887
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,319
the projection

888
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:43,040
star high convolved with the projection

889
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:46,160
of G star high. So that's lambda 4

890
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:49,280
high parts and that's

891
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:54,079
no sorry. So this is sorry this is piq

892
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:57,280
of f convolved with piq of g

893
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,440
restricted to star high. So that that's

894
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,640
lema one

895
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:06,160
convolution plays well with projections.

896
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,200
And then lamma 4

897
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:12,880
says that that's that.

898
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:19,920
And so now the l infinity norm is

899
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:27,520
bounded by piq of f* high l2

900
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:27,520
piq of g star high l2. That's lema 3.

901
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:34,240
And then that's bounded by or that's

902
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,520
lamma sorry that's lamma 2

903
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:41,520
and then that's bounded by just

904
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:44,880
pi q of fi l2

905
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:47,680
pi q of g pi

906
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,680
and that's lema

907
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:12,400
Okay. So, let let me summarize a little

908
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:14,000
bit and then pause to check in. Um

909
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,240
so

910
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,800
so issue that we're dealing with is like

911
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,079
L2 norms versus L infinity norms. So

912
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,480
we're trying to prove something that's

913
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:25,119
true for every uh moduli class. So it's

914
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,960
an L infinity norm. But our techniques

915
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,599
that come from for analysis and so on

916
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,839
usually tells us about L2 norms. So if

917
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,839
you have a bound like this, it tells you

918
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,599
that pi q of f is pretty evenly

919
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:39,440
distributed

920
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,720
at most a and you're trying to prove a

921
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,400
bound like this that says that the

922
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:45,920
projection of this thing is pretty

923
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:48,079
evenly distributed at every a.

924
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:52,160
Okay. And the point of this proposition,

925
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:54,640
it says that if piq of f and piq of g

926
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:58,079
are pretty evenly distributed just at

927
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,920
most a, then the projection of their

928
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:03,119
convolution is pretty evenly distributed

929
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:06,240
at every.

930
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:09,240
And so that's why being a convolution is

931
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,240
helpful.

932
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:20,359
Okay,

933
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,800
cool. So, a little pause for questions

934
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,800
and comments.

935
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:38,480
Okay, cool. So, now let's go on. And

936
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:40,880
these two things are controlled by the

937
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,680
large civ. The large div tells us that

938
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:47,359
if f is some function, then this L2 norm

939
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,960
is small for most Q. And so we're going

940
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,720
to write down that bound and see how

941
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:52,640
small it is. And then we're going to

942
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:56,280
plug it into this proposition. We'll get

943
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,280
a bound for this.

944
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:22,079
Okay. So large sip

945
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:25,280
remember that P M is the set of P prime

946
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:28,880
P around M.

947
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,880
Okay. And so we proved in class. So and

948
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,880
so we'll always have a function which is

949
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,559
defined on the integers up to n and it

950
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:41,760
goes to c and we proved in class that if

951
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:43,200
you take the sum p and pm of um so that

952
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,800
so in class we thought about what

953
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,480
happens if m is smaller than the square

954
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:52,960
root of n then we got the sum

955
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:57,920
pi q of f high l2

956
00:52:52,960 --> 00:53:00,920
and that is bounded by n / m * just half

957
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,920
l.

958
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:09,040
Okay. Um m could be bigger than n to the

959
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,800
half and that will be relevant in in

960
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,880
this story. It's often relevant and the

961
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,880
proof idea is the same but the then it

962
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,000
works out a little bit differently. So

963
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:24,079
if m is bigger than n to the half then

964
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:27,040
this same sum is bounded by m * f2.

965
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:29,920
So this one was in class

966
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:32,240
and this one is on the homework.

967
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,240
So I' I've posted the homework for for

968
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,240
next week. And the first problem is to

969
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,480
do this mostly as a way of thinking

970
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,400
through how the large civ worked. And

971
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:44,359
then the second bit is about the Linux

972
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,359
thing about quadratic residues.

973
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,040
Okay. Cool.

974
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:59,920
Okay. So now we are going to um plug

975
00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:02,960
these things into here.

976
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:06,720
Um so we get al together I guess I'll

977
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:09,280
call it a theorem. Um

978
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:13,839
let's say like this.

979
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:19,200
So suppose f is a function on n1 up to c

980
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:21,280
and g is a function on numbers up to n2.

981
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,359
And so if I take their multiplicative

982
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:29,559
convolution that will be a function on

983
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:29,559
the integers up to n where n is n1 * n2.

984
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:40,319
Okay. And then um I can take the sum

985
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,240
p and pm

986
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:47,520
of

987
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:51,599
um f convolved with g. I project it mod

988
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,880
Q. I maybe take the high take the star

989
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:54,400
part. That doesn't matter if you do it

990
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,760
or not, but in our application, we'll do

991
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:59,200
it. And then subtract off the constant.

992
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,800
Right? So the idea is that this thing

993
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,319
should be pretty close to constant much

994
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:05,960
of the time. So we look at the

995
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:05,960
non-constant part.

996
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,319
Okay? And then that is bounded by

997
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:14,400
there's an expression that's slightly

998
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:17,920
messy. And then we have FL2

999
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,839
and GL2.

1000
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,599
Okay. And the thing that goes in here

1001
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:26,599
when you work it out is um I have to

1002
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,599
check

1003
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,599
Yeah. When you're defining uh f the

1004
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:58,720
convolution of f and g as a function

1005
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:00,880
like integers up to n like how is that

1006
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:05,559
defined for the the product pair one

1007
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,559
times like n

1008
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:12,319
f and g are individually only two right

1009
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,680
>> yes yes so you should that's right so

1010
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:18,359
you should imagine f and g being

1011
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,359
extended as zero beyond that

1012
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,280
>> yeah

1013
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,200
So, so the question was how to define in

1014
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,079
the definition of this we'll have all

1015
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:30,240
the pairs little n1* little n2 that

1016
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,720
multiply to n and it could happen that

1017
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:35,200
little n1 or little n2 are too big to

1018
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:39,960
lie in this in this region and and then

1019
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,960
we just set set f to be zero there.

1020
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,450
Okay. Um, oh, and sorry. And this is L

1021
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:51,840
infinity. It's not L2.

1022
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:51,840
[Applause]

1023
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:00,640
Okay. Um,

1024
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:04,480
so, so one thing that I

1025
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:06,160
find a little a little difficult about

1026
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,240
the proof for teaching the proof is that

1027
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,839
it is the formulas are a little bit

1028
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,559
complicated.

1029
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:14,720
Um but the idea of this is to just

1030
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:18,480
combine the large civ and this

1031
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:21,119
proposition right. So if you start with

1032
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,440
the left hand side and you just apply

1033
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,440
this proposition

1034
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:31,119
um

1035
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:37,119
then we get yeah I guess we don't don't

1036
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:42,640
need that. Um we get a sum p and pm

1037
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:47,799
of pi q of f high l2

1038
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,799
pi q of g high in l2.

1039
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,119
So the proposition just said that this l

1040
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:54,640
infinity norm is bounded by this

1041
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:57,200
product. I copied down the sum.

1042
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,839
Um and then this looks a lot like the

1043
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:03,520
input of the large civ. So if I koshy

1044
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:07,599
schwarz it I get the sum

1045
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:09,680
pi q of fi l2^2

1046
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:13,559
to the 12

1047
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,559
uh and then the sum

1048
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:26,760
pi q of g pi l2 to the 12

1049
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,760
and then I apply the large civ.

1050
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,680
So the largest civ gives a bound for

1051
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,799
each of these things and I plug it in.

1052
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,319
And then what makes it a little bit

1053
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:36,720
messy is that because there are two

1054
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:40,400
cases the bound for this is a sum of two

1055
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:42,240
terms and the bound for this is a sum of

1056
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,720
two terms.

1057
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,480
So then I multiply that together I get

1058
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,640
the sum of two terms times that sum of

1059
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,640
two terms.

1060
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,440
Okay. Um,

1061
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:11,799
now in the setting of of our main

1062
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,799
theorem about primes,

1063
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:24,799
the theorem of Reni and Bombi and

1064
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:28,799
Venograov. Um, the size of f

1065
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:31,680
and the size of g would be around one

1066
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:34,079
where they're defined. And so the L2

1067
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:39,359
norms of f and g

1068
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:43,280
would be around uh around n1 and n2 and

1069
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:47,280
squared would be around n2.

1070
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:51,119
Um so if you plug that all in then we

1071
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:55,000
get our sum l infinity would be bounded

1072
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:55,000
by um

1073
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:11,680
n / m + the square<unk> of n1 n plus the

1074
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:13,119
square<unk> of n2n

1075
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:15,680
plus

1076
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:18,680
m root n.

1077
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,680
Um

1078
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:26,480
and um

1079
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,599
uh

1080
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:31,920
and then our our goal

1081
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:36,319
would be that this sum is much smaller

1082
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:39,520
than n. So it's it's good

1083
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:41,839
as long as m is less than n^ the 1/2

1084
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,640
minus epsilon. That's where that

1085
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:48,319
condition comes from, the range of Q.

1086
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:51,960
And as long as N1 and N2 are much

1087
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:51,960
smaller than N.

1088
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:04,079
Okay. Um, so in this part, you know, I I

1089
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:06,079
did I I I redid the computation at home

1090
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,640
and it's a little bit messy. I did spend

1091
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:10,400
some time trying to think

1092
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,559
if there's a way of saying it without

1093
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,680
computing to see when when it works well

1094
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:18,799
and when it doesn't work well. Um I have

1095
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,920
a couple comments about that. I don't I

1096
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:22,480
don't feel like I know how to see

1097
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:26,559
everything that way yet.

1098
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:31,359
Um so one comment is that it doesn't

1099
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:33,200
work very well if n1 or n2 is almost n

1100
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:34,559
and there's a conceptual reason for

1101
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,880
that.

1102
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:41,040
So suppose n_sub_2 was n that means n1

1103
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:44,000
would be one.

1104
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:46,720
So my f is supported just on one and my

1105
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,559
g is supported all the way on up to n.

1106
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:53,680
And when I convolve them together f I I

1107
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:55,280
I just get g times the value of f at

1108
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:58,640
one.

1109
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,559
So so in that situation there's no

1110
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:03,359
special structure of this function. It's

1111
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:05,599
a it's a totally arbitrary function.

1112
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:07,520
Um and since our this kind of theorem is

1113
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,079
not true for arbitrary functions, it

1114
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:13,480
can't work in when n1 and n2 are really

1115
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,480
close to n.

1116
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:19,359
Okay.

1117
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:21,440
Um so as long as n1 and n2 are kind of

1118
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:23,680
even, there's there's a meaningful

1119
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,520
convolution going on. As long as neither

1120
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,359
of them is close to one, neither of them

1121
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,520
is close to n, there's a meaningful

1122
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:34,000
convolution structure going on. And in

1123
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:38,160
that setting, these terms are okay.

1124
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:41,200
Um, this term here is okay as long as M

1125
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:42,880
is big. We need M to be M is reasonably

1126
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,160
big. We need M to be reasonably big so

1127
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,680
that we're actually looking at many

1128
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,200
different projections because we're just

1129
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,920
looking at one projection. We can never

1130
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:52,559
say anything about it

1131
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:55,119
just using projection theory. Okay. And

1132
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:57,920
here we need M to be not too much bigger

1133
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:01,200
than the square root of N. And the

1134
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:04,240
reason for that is

1135
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:06,160
um so one important case here is when n1

1136
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,559
and n2 are equal. So they would both be

1137
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:10,559
the square root of n.

1138
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:13,040
And if m is bigger than the square root

1139
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,680
of n m would be bigger than both n1 and

1140
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:18,240
n2.

1141
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:21,359
And when that happens

1142
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:23,920
um the theorem might still be true but

1143
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:27,920
the proof doesn't work very well. You

1144
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:29,440
see if m is bigger than n1 and n2

1145
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,319
you know I have this function f that's

1146
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:35,920
defined on the numbers up to n1 and then

1147
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:38,960
I tried projecting at mod q where q is

1148
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,960
around m. So q is actually bigger than

1149
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,440
n1. So this projection operation is

1150
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:46,480
extremely uninteresting

1151
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:50,799
right I just the the first n1 elements I

1152
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:53,440
copy down and the rest I put zero.

1153
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:55,359
So since that projection operation is

1154
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:58,079
trivial,

1155
01:03:55,359 --> 01:04:02,359
no theorem from projection theory is

1156
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:02,359
going to say anything useful here.

1157
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:11,680
Um the um the gain that we're getting is

1158
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:14,799
that if as long as so you know I need

1159
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:17,359
either n1 or n2 to be bigger than m in

1160
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:21,039
order to get off the ground. Once n1 or

1161
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:23,760
n2 is bigger than m say let's say n2 is

1162
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:25,920
bigger than m then when I look at these

1163
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,240
projections most of them are almost

1164
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,839
constant

1165
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,319
that's where the mileage is coming from

1166
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:33,839
so these guys are almost constant these

1167
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:36,960
guys might or might not be almost

1168
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:38,480
constant it's okay either way and then

1169
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,880
when I convolve it together the

1170
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:42,880
convolution is almost constant and in a

1171
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,039
strong sense it's everywhere almost

1172
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:48,599
constant instead of just most places

1173
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,599
almost constant Actually

1174
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,280
another kind of visual thing is so so

1175
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:01,039
say this guy is almost constant but not

1176
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,880
everywhere. So in most places it's

1177
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:06,480
almost constant but a couple of places

1178
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,319
it has a big bump. When I take the this

1179
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,559
convolution

1180
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:12,799
then at any gi to evaluate the

1181
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:14,400
convolution at any given point I have to

1182
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:17,039
look at the contribution of this at

1183
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,960
every point and so those couple of

1184
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:21,359
places only contribute a little and

1185
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:25,799
mostly I see the contribution of the of

1186
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:25,799
the of the places where this is small.

1187
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,319
Okay, so that's what's going on. And

1188
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,319
then you do have to do some algebra uh

1189
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:35,319
to see just how much we learned from

1190
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:35,319
that.

1191
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:42,119
Okay, so now let's go back to our

1192
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,119
theorem.

1193
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,079
All right. And this last part, I'm not

1194
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,079
going to do every detail, which even

1195
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,280
gets a little bit messier, but I'll just

1196
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:11,200
say the the skeleton, and then we'll

1197
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:14,640
pause.

1198
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:18,720
Okay. So, let's say that s is the primes

1199
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:20,960
uh up to n to the 1/2. And then remember

1200
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:22,799
that um

1201
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:26,079
that

1202
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:29,119
if say n / two is less than p is less

1203
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:33,039
than n or actually just n^ the 1/2 is

1204
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:38,160
less than n is less than n then rs r

1205
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:39,920
relatively prime to s of n is prime. So

1206
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:42,880
we can basically study this function by

1207
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:46,000
studying that function.

1208
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:51,920
And then we also know that relatively

1209
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:55,200
prime s of n is one convolved with dp1

1210
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:57,520
convolved with dpr and these are all

1211
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:00,240
multiplicative convolutions.

1212
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:01,839
So if I want to make this this whole

1213
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:04,640
thing is is like a ton of multiplicative

1214
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:07,520
convolutions. But if I just want to see

1215
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:12,359
two of them then I could say it's this

1216
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:12,359
guy convolved with that guy.

1217
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:20,319
Okay. Now this function as written it

1218
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:23,200
goes on forever and this function goes

1219
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:27,920
on forever but I only want to evaluate

1220
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:30,400
this up to capital n. So

1221
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,880
um you know

1222
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:36,319
this guy at n1 and this guy at n2 will

1223
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,760
only after they they come together in

1224
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:41,760
the convolution they'll only be relevant

1225
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:46,319
if n1 * n2 is less than capital n. So

1226
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:49,599
what I'll do is I'll write this as a sum

1227
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:52,079
on i1 of f times the characteristic

1228
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:54,720
function of i1. So I'll just divide up

1229
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:57,680
the numbers into some intervals

1230
01:07:54,720 --> 01:08:01,200
and I'm going to convolve that with a

1231
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:03,520
sum over i2 of g characteristic function

1232
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,440
of i2

1233
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:13,599
and I can open up the parenthesis. It's

1234
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:17,839
the sum i1 and i2 of f i1 f i1 convolved

1235
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:20,319
with g i2.

1236
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:23,319
Okay.

1237
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:23,319
Um

1238
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:30,319
and now if I only want to capture this

1239
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:34,080
up to capital N. So let me say that N1

1240
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:36,319
is the maximum of I1 and N2 is the

1241
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:38,960
maximum of I2.

1242
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:41,600
Um

1243
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:45,920
so for little n less than or equal to

1244
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:51,440
capital n rps of n will be the sum over

1245
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:53,440
i1 i2 of uh f characteristic function of

1246
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:55,600
i1 convolved with g characteristic

1247
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:58,799
function of i2

1248
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:01,920
and here I can assume that n1 * n2 is

1249
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:04,960
less than around n

1250
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,560
uh because otherwise the the product of

1251
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,560
these two maybe I should make this the

1252
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,560
minimum.

1253
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:15,120
Yeah, because otherwise the product of

1254
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,960
these two intervals will be bigger than

1255
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:20,359
capital n. So it won't have any

1256
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,359
influence here.

1257
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:28,480
Okay. Um

1258
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:30,700
and um so then for each of these we

1259
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:38,159
apply the theorem

1260
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:40,880
[Applause]

1261
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:43,120
theorem a that theorem there and it

1262
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:46,480
tells me that when I reduce these things

1263
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:50,440
mod q for most q's the non-constant part

1264
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:50,440
is small in l infinity

1265
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,000
okay so this works for most of the terms

1266
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:07,400
that works as long as n1 and n2 are much

1267
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,400
bigger than one and much less than n.

1268
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:15,840
But it could happen a part a piece of

1269
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:18,000
this would be this guy

1270
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:20,480
with i2 very close to one or even just

1271
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,040
the point one convolved with that guy

1272
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:27,199
that's in there too. How do you deal

1273
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:29,440
with that? Well, this function f is

1274
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:32,800
itself a big convolution.

1275
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:36,600
So um so then I can take f and I split

1276
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:36,600
it up and I keep going.

1277
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:44,719
All right.

1278
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:48,960
So if n1 is almost n and n2 is almost

1279
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:51,120
one use f is f_sub_1 convolved with

1280
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,080
f_sub_2.

1281
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:57,280
So this part gets a little bit messy.

1282
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:59,440
Um and um

1283
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:01,600
uh to be honest, I'm not positive

1284
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:05,520
whether this exact thing works. This is

1285
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:07,920
a possible project. Um the what what you

1286
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:11,120
what so what I read in analytic number

1287
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:13,440
theory books is a slightly fancier way

1288
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:15,920
of taking this function characteristic

1289
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,320
function of prime numbers and uh writing

1290
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:20,239
it as in terms of some multiplicative

1291
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,920
convolutions. And for the slightly

1292
01:11:20,239 --> 01:11:24,400
fancier way, there end up being less

1293
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:27,360
terms here and it it it works out more

1294
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:29,040
cleanly, but it also at least I had a

1295
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:33,199
little bit more trouble motivating it

1296
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:35,199
and seeing how people thought of it. Um

1297
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:37,040
anyway, so I I'm not positive. I think

1298
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:40,239
that this may work in all details or or

1299
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:42,159
or maybe not quite. Maybe it requires

1300
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:44,400
more fidgeting.

1301
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:46,400
Um but nevertheless I think it shows the

1302
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:50,600
main ideas that go into proving the

1303
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,600
bombier vineigra theorem.

1304
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:04,000
>> Sorry I'm still a little confused. So

1305
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:06,560
what are those intervals I1 and I2?

1306
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:10,159
>> Yeah what are the intervals I1 and I2?

1307
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:12,080
Um so at f you might first try diatic

1308
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:14,800
intervals.

1309
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:17,199
And um

1310
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,560
um

1311
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:23,280
and so mod modular technical details

1312
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,719
that's good. Um but actually there's a

1313
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,239
little problem with taking diatic

1314
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:30,800
intervals that wherever you stop you'll

1315
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:33,120
get um this function will be exactly the

1316
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,800
function that we want up to capital n.

1317
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:37,199
And then it'll go a little bit beyond

1318
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:40,239
capital n and there'll be some stuff

1319
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:43,199
that's uh not exactly this function

1320
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:45,040
anymore. and then it'll die off.

1321
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:46,880
And we'd like to prove that you just

1322
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:48,560
take this function and sharply cut it

1323
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,560
off at capital n. We'd like that to be

1324
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,480
evenly distributed.

1325
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:54,480
But we have this extra sort of junk at

1326
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:56,880
the end.

1327
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,800
And um okay, so that's a problem. And

1328
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,199
the solution to that problem is we could

1329
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:03,120
we can greatly reduce the amount of junk

1330
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:05,760
by replacing diatic intervals by

1331
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:08,560
intervals that are somewhat narrower.

1332
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:11,840
Um, if we make i1 and i2 kind of narrow,

1333
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:14,000
then whenever i1 times i2 crosses over

1334
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,199
n, it will only cross over a little bit.

1335
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,719
So, we'll have only a little bit of

1336
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:21,239
junk.

1337
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:21,239
So, that's who I are.

1338
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,760
>> Yeah.

1339
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:31,360
>> Can we recap what properties of RPS we

1340
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,520
we used?

1341
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:37,199
>> Yeah. The question was can we recap what

1342
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:40,320
what properties of RPS we used. Okay. So

1343
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:42,400
the first property is that RPS detects

1344
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,960
primes and that property is written

1345
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:47,360
here. So S is the primes that are less

1346
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:50,320
than N to the half and on this big

1347
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:52,320
region RPS of N is the same as just

1348
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:56,159
characteristic function of primes tells

1349
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:58,800
us whose prime. Okay. Um but this

1350
01:13:56,159 --> 01:14:00,400
function is nicer than this function on

1351
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:03,199
the face of it because it has a second

1352
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,960
good property which is that it is a

1353
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:08,520
multiplicative convolution of a whole

1354
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,520
bunch of things together.

1355
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,880
Um and so we in particular can split it

1356
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:17,400
up like this and we see it has this

1357
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,400
multiplicative convolution structure.

1358
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,120
I guess another thing that I used

1359
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:23,600
without saying it as clearly as I should

1360
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:26,480
have is that we use that pointwise f and

1361
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,159
g are bounded by around one

1362
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,400
and that comes about for the following

1363
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:33,199
reason. Pointwise all of these functions

1364
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:36,400
are bounded by by one uh from the

1365
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:38,719
definitions. Um and then if you look at

1366
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:41,120
f at a point n

1367
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:43,360
well there are different ways of

1368
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:46,480
factoring n and so they contribute

1369
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:48,320
different amounts. Um, and there aren't

1370
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:53,560
very many ways to factor a number. And

1371
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:53,560
so, and so f of is pretty small.

1372
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,320
Um, and I think that's it. I think

1373
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:01,640
that's all that we used about RPS and

1374
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,640
about primes.

1375
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:06,719
Proving things about primes is a funny

1376
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:10,960
business because we don't know that much

1377
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:12,800
about primes. And so, you know, you you

1378
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,080
theorem, you know, some something about

1379
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,679
the primes, you could ask, well, what

1380
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:19,360
what input about the primes did we put

1381
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:20,960
into this theorem? And there's not that

1382
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:24,080
many different things that we know how

1383
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:27,960
to use as input. Um, anyway, and so for

1384
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:27,960
today, it was this thing.

1385
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:39,360
>> Yeah. in the coaching shores

1386
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:43,719
on water. Do you always know something

1387
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,719
or situations?

1388
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:48,480
>> Ah, good. Good. Okay, there's a great

1389
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,000
question and I'll there was a specific

1390
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,000
question but the the big picture

1391
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,560
question was at what steps in this

1392
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:58,080
argument did we lose something? Right?

1393
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:59,600
So, we proved a theorem uh here. It's a

1394
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,880
nice theorem but it's not the whole

1395
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,400
truth. We put at the beginning the

1396
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,840
conjectures of what we believe are true

1397
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,760
which are way stronger than this in

1398
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,360
several respects.

1399
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:10,159
Therefore, we must have lost some things

1400
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:12,960
in this theorem. Where did we lose them?

1401
01:16:10,159 --> 01:16:15,520
Let's think through the proof.

1402
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,199
Okay, so this is an equality. The primes

1403
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,880
really are this thing. And this thing

1404
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:21,520
really is a convolution. So we haven't

1405
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:24,400
lost anything yet. We can now break the

1406
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:27,920
convolution up into pieces like this. I

1407
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:29,360
don't think we lost too much here. There

1408
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,920
there is this very annoying business

1409
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:34,800
about the I1 I2 going over the edge and

1410
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,640
having to make I1 and I2 small. So there

1411
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:39,520
there is some loss associated to that

1412
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:41,840
annoying business. So that's one one one

1413
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:45,040
piece of loss. Okay. Then let's just

1414
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:48,320
focus on one of one of these pieces.

1415
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:52,150
Um that piece got fed into theorem A. So

1416
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:54,560
let's switch to ports.

1417
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:57,120
[Applause]

1418
01:16:54,560 --> 01:17:00,120
Okay. So now we fed our piece into this

1419
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,120
theorem.

1420
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,840
Okay,

1421
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:08,320
this theorem is not usually sharp. So f

1422
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:11,199
and g are two particular functions and

1423
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:14,560
for those two functions um probably

1424
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:17,600
something much stronger is true.

1425
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:19,679
Um let's think about where we lost

1426
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,440
something.

1427
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:25,199
All right, so we wrote down the left

1428
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:27,840
hand side. So far so good. Then we

1429
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:29,920
applied the proposition

1430
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:31,440
at basically we said this is a

1431
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:33,360
convolution and you can bound the L

1432
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:35,199
infinity norm of the convolution by the

1433
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:39,600
product of the L2 norms by Koshy

1434
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:41,520
Schwarz. This step here is a big loser.

1435
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,239
This is I didn't bring my I didn't bring

1436
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:50,520
my red chalk but I would put a big red

1437
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:50,520
star here. Uh this is a big lossy step.

1438
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:56,640
Um

1439
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,320
right so so remember that this this guy

1440
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,560
is a high part so it has average zero

1441
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:03,040
and this guy has average zero when we

1442
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,719
convolve them together there are a lot

1443
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:07,120
of positive and negative signs that

1444
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:10,560
appear usually there will be

1445
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:12,000
cancellation there but our we don't

1446
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,080
didn't take advantage of any of that

1447
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,400
cancellation we just used the triangle

1448
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:21,040
inequality and so we got this upper

1449
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:23,120
bound that's that's probably very lossy.

1450
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:26,239
So for our particular functions f and g

1451
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:28,239
that step was probably very lossy.

1452
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:31,360
Now this this more general theorem holds

1453
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:33,520
for any functions f and g which is nice.

1454
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:37,040
If you could choose any f and g then for

1455
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:39,120
one particular q that may well have been

1456
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:41,840
correct. You could rig f and g so that

1457
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:44,960
for one particular q this uh koshi

1458
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:48,239
schwarz uh was sharp. But I don't know

1459
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:51,280
how to rig f and g so that for most of

1460
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:53,840
these ps or q's um something like that

1461
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:56,960
happens. It sounds even unlikely to me

1462
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:59,040
that that is true. Um so it's plausible

1463
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,719
that without any more input about prime

1464
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:03,040
numbers it's plausible that there's a

1465
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,800
much stronger version of this theorem.

1466
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:07,280
Um

1467
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:09,040
but I have no idea how to prove it.

1468
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:10,800
Okay. So that was our big lossy step.

1469
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,880
Then we went on to the next step. We did

1470
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:15,280
this koshi schwarz. I don't think this

1471
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:18,320
one is so bad. Um for for this Koshy

1472
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:21,120
Schwarz to be sharp, we just means that

1473
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:22,960
um it would it would be sharp if for the

1474
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:24,640
different PS all these L2 norms were

1475
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,719
about the same as each other. I think

1476
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:30,080
that usually happens

1477
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:34,719
and then we applied the large civ um and

1478
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:38,159
the large civ itself is

1479
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:40,640
is usually not lossy in the key in the

1480
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:44,480
key ranges. So this is the really

1481
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:48,000
important loss here and require a big

1482
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:50,239
new idea to do better. Cool. Nice

1483
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,679
questions everybody. Um let's let's

1484
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:53,120
break there but I'll also hang out for

1485
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:57,000
office hours if there are more things

1486
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:57,000
that people want to talk about.
