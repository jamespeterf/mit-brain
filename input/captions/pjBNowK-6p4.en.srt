17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,719
heat to directly split water and

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,640
generate hydrogen a clean fuel that can

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,160
power long-distance trucks ships and

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,440
is largely produced through processes

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,680
that involve natural gas and other

offers a totally emissions-free

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,560
alternative as it relies entirely on

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,759
renewable solar energy to drive hydrogen

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,280

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,799
designs have limited efficiency only

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,200
about 7% of incoming sunlight is used to

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,040
make hydrogen the results so far have

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,439
been low yield and high cost and a big

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,759
step toward realizing solar made fuels

38
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:37,040
the MIT team estimates its new design

39
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:39,720
could harness up to 40% of the sun's

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,640
heat to generate that much more hydrogen

41
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,799
the increase in efficiency could drive

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,360
down the system's overall cost making St

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,399
a potentially scalable affordable option

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,600
to help decarbonize the transportation

45
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,399
industry we're thinking of hydrogen as

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,799
the fuel of the future and there's a

47
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,079

with an existing source of solar heat

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,280
such as a concentrated solar plant CSP a

68
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:49,080
circular array of hundreds of mirrors

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,319
that collect and reflect sunlight to a

70
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,280
central receiving Tower an stch system

71
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,959
then absorbs the receiver's heat and

72
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,239
directs it to split water and produce

73
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,040
hydrogen this process is very different

74
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,720
from electrolysis which uses us

75
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,840
electricity instead of heat to split

76
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,280
water at the heart of a conceptual stch

77
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,840
system is a two-step thermochemical

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,440
reaction in the first step water in the

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,440
form of steam is exposed to a metal this

80
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,480
causes the metal to grab oxygen from

81
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,680
Steam leaving hydrogen behind this metal

82
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,840
oxidation is similar to the resting of

83
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,480
iron in the presence of water but it

84
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,480
occurs much faster once hydrogen is

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,159
separated the oxidized or rusted metal

86
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,879
is reheated in a vacuum which acts to

87
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,000
reverse the rusting process and

88
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:35,959
regenerate the metal with the oxygen

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,760
removed the metal can be cooled and

90
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,120
exposed to steam again to produce more

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,080
hydrogen this process can be repeated

92
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,480
hundreds of times the MIT system is

93
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,680
designed to optimize this process the

94
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,560
system as a whole resembles a train of

95
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,159
box-shaped reactors running on a

96
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,120
circular track in practice this track

97
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,400
would be set around a solar thermal

98
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,280
Source such as a CSP Tower each reactor

99
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,040
in the train would house the metal that

100
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,560
under go the Redux or reversible rusting

101
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:06,480
process each reactor would first pass

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,879
through a hot station where it would be

103
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,599
exposed to the sun's Heat at

104
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,879
temperatures of up to 1,

105
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,720
1500° this extreme heat would

106
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,959
effectively pull oxygen out of a

107
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,560
reactor's metal that metal would then be

108
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,720
in a reduced State ready to grab oxygen

109
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,759
from Steam for this to happen the

110
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,680
reactor would move to a cooler station

111
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,280
at temperatures around 1,000° C where it

112
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,840
would be exposed to steam to produce

113
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,000
hydrogen

114
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,400
rust and

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,800
rails other similar stch Concepts have

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,720
run up against a common obstacle what to

117
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
do with the heat released by the reduced

118
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,720
reactor as it is cooled without

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,759
recovering and reusing this heat the

120
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,199
system's efficiency is too low to be

121
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,400
practical a second challenge has to do

122
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,199
with creating an energy efficient vacuum

123
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,639
Where Metal can dust some prototypes

124
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,120
generate a vacuum using mechanical pumps

125
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,000
though the pumps are too energy

126
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,280
intensive and costly for large scale

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,680
hydrogen production to to address these

128
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,080
challenges the MIT design incorporates

129
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,639
several energy saving workarounds to

130
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,440
recover most of the heat that would

131
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,080
otherwise escape from the system

132
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,160
reactors on opposite sides of the

133
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,440
circular track are allowed to exchange

134
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,680
heat through thermal radiation hot

135
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,720
reactors get cooled while cool reactors

136
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,319
get heated this keeps the heat within

137
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,440
the system the researchers also added a

138
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,440
second set of reactors that would circle

139
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,919
around the first train moving in the

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,880
opposite direction this outer train of

141
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,199
reactors would operate at generally

142
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,199
cooler temperatures and would be used to

143
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,360
evacuate oxygen from the hotter inner

144
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,759
train without the need for energy

145
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,600
consuming mechanical pumps these outer

146
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,360
reactors would carry a second type of

147
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,720
metal that can also easily oxidize as

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,520
they circle around the outer reactors

149
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,039
would absorb oxygen from the inner

150
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,120
reactors effectively derusting the

151
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,600
original metal without having to use

152
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,919
energy intensive vacuum pumps both

153
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,680
reactor trains would run continuously

154
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,479
and would generate separate streams of

155
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,440
pure hydrogen and oxygen the researchers

156
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,560
carried out detailed simulations of the

157
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,440
conceptual design and found that it

158
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,360
would significantly boost the efficiency

159
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,120
of solar thermochemical hydrogen

160
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,759
production from 7% as previous designs

161
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,199
have demonstrated to 40% we have to

162
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:18,400
think of every bit of energy in the

163
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,520
system and how to use it to minimize the

164
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,120
cost godem says and with this design we

165
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,400
found that everything can be powered by

166
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,880
heat coming from the Sun it is able to

167
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,120
use 40% of the sun's heat to produce

168
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,560
hydrogen if this can be realized it

169
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,960
could drastically change our Energy

170
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,720
Future namely enabling hydrogen

171
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,280

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,240
sunlight in the next year the team will

178
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,199
be building a prototype of the system

179
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,800
that they plan to test in concentrated

180

of the Department of energy which is

currently funding the project when fully

183
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:03,440
implemented the system would be housed

184
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,160
in a little building in the middle of a

185
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,080
solar field patker explains inside the

186
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,000
building there could be one or more

187
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,240
trains each having about 50 reactors and

188
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,039
we think this could be a modular system
