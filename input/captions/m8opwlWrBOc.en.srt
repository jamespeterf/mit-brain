00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,600
Hi everyone, thank you for joining

2
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,560
today's seminar. It this will be our

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,560
last seminar and it's my great pleasure

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,359
to be able to introduce today's uh

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,640
seminar speaker, Professor Deep Gerbala

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,559
from UPEN. Uh, professor Jerbala is an

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,640
associate professor and the Peter and

8
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,320
Suzanne Armstrong distinguished scholar

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,160
in the electrical and systems

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,719
engineering as well as material science

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,120
and engineering at UPEN. He completed

12
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,760
his PhD material science and engineering

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,079
at Northwestern University and was a

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,160
post-doal fellow at Caltech before

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,199
starting at UPEN.

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,359
uh his group's research uh interest uh

17
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,199
is broad and it lies at the intersection

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,680
of new material surface science and

19
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,519
solid state devices for computing opto

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,200
electronics and energy harvesting

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,600
applications in addition to the

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,159
development of correlated and functional

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,560
imaging techniques. His research has

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,000
been widely recognized with tremendous

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,360
number of awards. I'm just going to name

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,560

34
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,759
Um, professor Jeriala serves as the

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,360
associate editor for ACS nano letters

36
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,280
and has been appointed as a

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,759
distinguished lecturer for the ITE

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,600
nanotechnology council for 2025. So it's

39
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,920
a pleasure to have him here today with

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,360
us. I h the floor is yours. I just

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,799
remind everyone in the room if you want

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,119
to ask questions feel free to raise your

43
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,799
hand directly ask. We do have audience

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,439
over zoom. Please type your questions

45
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,680
and I'll help moderate. Please help me

46
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,200
welcome our speaker. Okay, great.

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,720
All right, thank you Fernas for the very

48
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,400
kind introduction and thank you all for

49
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,720
making it here. It's a great pleasure to

50
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,520
speak uh here for the MIT Nano seminar

51
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,879
series. Um I realize that my pointer is

52
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,040
not going to work in this specularly

53
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,560
reflective screen. So I'm just going to

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,520
use my hands to point to various things

55
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,000
on the slides. Okay. Um so uh let me get

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,959
started by uh thanking the people who

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,080
actually do the work. uh I often say at

58
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,400
the beginning of my talk I'm a

59
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,400
professional pan handler who goes and

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,920
seeks for resources to run my research

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,920
and actually this the students and

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,480
postocs who end up doing all the

63
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,560
important work in the lab. So definitely

64
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,720
uh uh none of the work would be possible

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,720
without them. Certainly we have been

66
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,560
very fortunate to be funded by a wide

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,879
number of uh funding agencies both in

68
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,120
the government as well as uh uh uh

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,560
industries and some private foundations.

70
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,080
And finally, all the work that I'm

71
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,000
presenting, especially the three nitride

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,720
work has been done in collaboration with

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,319
professor Troy Olsson and Eric Stack uh

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,560
who have been my partners in crime in

75
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,200
this uh in this amazing new area of

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,040
research. Uh Troy Olsson used to work in

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,000
nitride pzole electrics for a long time

78
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,480
and so uh together with him we were able

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,239
to switch to nitride federals. So with

80
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,760
that let me introduce the broad

81
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,120
divisions in the research group. The

82
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,680
research group is divided into three

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,200
major sections.

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,720
The first one is what I'm going to be

85
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,800
focusing most of my talk on today which

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,799
is nano electronics. Here we look at

87
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,720
both the logic and memory devices which

88
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,280
means transistors as well as meristers

89
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,680
of some sort that can do either logic

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,959
functions or data storage functions.

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,480
Certainly I won't be able to talk much

92
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,879
about logic today. It'll be focused on

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,159
the memory aspect. Um then the other

94
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,120
part of the research which actually is

95
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,280
very quite closely related to Farna's

96
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,400
professor Tisdale professor Bulovich's

97
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,480
research um is in the area of novel

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,640
exotonic materials for opto electronic

99
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,319
applications and and that's another very

100
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,560
active area of research certainly in one

101
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,720
hour I cannot cover both of them so I'll

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,480
be focusing my efforts on a portion of

103
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,720
this area and finally we also synthesize

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,720
new materials via both MOCVDs coating um

105
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,760
as well as some solution phased

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,360
chemistry

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,040
again much of that uh I mean the

108
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,600
sputtering part I will introduce in a

109
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,199
slide but uh uh won't be able to cover

110
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,440
most of it today hopefully another

111
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,160
seminar another venue uh I'll be able to

112
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,600
cover that okay so let me uh harp in on

113
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,160
the focus of today's talk it's all on

114
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,160
three nitride federals I'll first given

115
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,000
this is a broad seminar talk I'm hoping

116
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,759
there's audience from various uh

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,960
departments at various stages of their

118
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,280
careers so some amount of u broad

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,040
introduction would be helpful uh on what

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,639
are nitride federals why are

121
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,800
interesting? Why are they useful? Why

122
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,440
could they potentially open up some very

123
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,280
interesting applications including

124
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,240
commercialization of the technology? And

125
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,440
then I'll focus uh or the second part of

126
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,440
the work on on ferroelectric uh memory

127
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,160
devices that you can make out of them uh

128
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,280
namely uh both for uh in terms of

129
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,639
transistors as ferlectric fed devices as

130
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,400
well as ferlectric meristers or or um uh

131
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,199
you could say ferlectric diode memory

132
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,520
devices, right? And then finally if time

133
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,039
permits and I may I may just rush across

134
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,759
this large portion if I don't have

135
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,320
enough time is why these nitride

136
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,840
federals are kind of a match made in

137
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,759
heaven for data storage in extreme

138
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,759
environments. Okay. So let me start with

139
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,440
the big picture question which is grand

140
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,320
challenges in modern classical

141
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,520
computing. I

142
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,120
know a lot of you would be probably

143
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,479
working on quantum computing and have

144
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,680
heard a lot about quantum computing.

145
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,919
Certainly quantum is very exciting, very

146
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,000
interesting. There is lot of interest in

147
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,840
it. Probably a lot of hype in it, right?

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,080
Um but I should say that classical

149
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,800
computing is a moving frontier. It is

150
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,960
something that is evolving uh uh with

151
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,880
every day or every every month, right?

152
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,800
And new challenges come up and there are

153
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,960
sort of two major or central challenges

154
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,759
to classical computing. One of them is

155
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,360
power consumption. And this graph uh was

156
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,520
created by the SRC, Semiconductor

157
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,160
Research Corporation, which shows you

158
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,280
how uh ICT applications which is

159
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,960
information and communications

160
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,800
technologies um are consuming energy uh

161
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,199
on on a global scale year after year.

162
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,759
And you can see that uh the computing

163
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,039
and communication graphs are quite

164
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:22,720
nonlinear compared to the global energy

165
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,319
production which is rather linear on a

166
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,160
lock scale or rather straight line on a

167
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,680
lock scale which which means the global

168
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,639
energy production does not increase by

169
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,479
more than five or 6% a year unless MIT

170
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,479
or some other university works out

171
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,639
fusion right in which case that graph's

172
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,160
slope can recre increase uh uh much more

173
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:43,360
rapidly

174
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,720
or we figure out a way to uh do

175
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,639
computing and communication much more

176
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,560
energy efficiently. We are going to face

177
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,880
some kind of crisis and not too far away

178
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,600
from now, right? We're around here 2025.

179
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,080
By mid 2030s, data centers are energy

180
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,680
for AI compute is going to consume a

181
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,319
vast fraction of electricity or energy

182
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,440
that humankind produces. There's a

183
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,199
second problem which is sort of

184
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,840
connected with the first problem which

185
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,000
is current big data compute or AI

186
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,599
compute which is largely driven by

187
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,919
crunching vast amounts of data,

188
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,280
searching, pattern matching, inferences,

189
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,360
right? uh is uh quite inefficient both

190
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,199
in terms of time and in terms of energy

191
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,960
and the central bottleneck for it is

192
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,080
what popularly known as the memory

193
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,840
bottleneck. What is this bottleneck? Let

194
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,280
me try and explain. Now this is a graph

195
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,720
taken from a startup company's website

196
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,319
but this is also widely available on

197
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,400
several government websites. Now there

198
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,800
are two graphs over here. One is a

199
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,560
rather nonlinear

200
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,080
looking exponentially increasing graph.

201
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,919
That is the graph telling you how many

202
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,520
number of parameters each of these the

203
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,360
progressing number of AI models that are

204
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,280
coming out right these parameters run

205
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,639
into the trillions now for example GPT4

206
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,639
is up there I'm sure many of you are

207
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,880
using it to do your homeworks or writing

208
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,880
papers right it's in the few trillions

209
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,840
right that's the number of parameters

210
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,400
GPT4 uses uh you can call it the weights

211
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,800
right in the model this line over here

212
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,759
which is somewhat uh less slope linear

213
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,599
looking that's the amount of memory

214
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,919
available to today's best AI processors

215
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,000
this is the DAM memory which basically

216
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,840
stores the weights and then the model is

217
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,960
running through these weights and so you

218
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,560
can see that the amount of memory

219
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,800
available versus the amount of

220
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,400
parameters required there is a large

221
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,720
exponential gap between them and it's

222
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,840
only going to increase right so this is

223
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,919
the quote unquote memory wall that slows

224
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,240
down or makes AI computing more energy

225
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,639
hungry more energy inefficient and

226
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,120
somehow this needs to get solved so the

227
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,120
bottom line is there is latency between

228
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,640
the logic and memory units and that's a

229
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,240
major bottom neck known as the void

230
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,159
nomen bottleneck which leads to

231
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
increased power consumption and sort of

232
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,200
these problems are in some sense

233
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,120
connected. Why is this important?

234
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,000
Certainly we as a society especially as

235
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,760
academics do care about energy right uh

236
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,920
and what we are going to face is this

237
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,120
kind of a scenario based on the previous

238
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,080
slides graph which is if you look at our

239
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,959
whole society uh together uh today we

240
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,160
are doing certain amount of computes uh

241
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,720
uh in terms of jewels per year right and

242
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,120
these uh green graph tells you how many

243
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,320
compute operations you are doing right

244
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,399
and these compute operations are

245
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,800
measured in what is known as zips which

246
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,080
is za input output or operations per

247
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,320
second. um za means 10 the^ 21 certainly

248
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,920
we have MIT as 10 the^ negative9 but

249
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,880
it's 10 the^ negative plus 21 right and

250
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,399
so um again this graph was created by

251
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,240
the src prehat GPT revolution but this

252
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,000
is only going to accelerate further and

253
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,640
if we continue to go across this

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,720
trajectory as a society um we will have

255
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,040
to saturate our computing needs at some

256
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,720
point to about a thousand zips I mean

257
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,480
these numbers vary depending on who you

258
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,839
ask what type of people are doing

259
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,760
estimates of is but uh we we do need

260
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,360
electricity or energy for other things.

261
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,680
Uh even if you drive all electric cars,

262
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,760
you need some energy to charge them. Uh

263
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,160
heating up, running these lights, right?

264
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,560
So there has to be some delta between

265
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,200
the green graph and the and the world's

266
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,880
energy production. And so that's uh so

267
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,600
that this essentially is going to lead

268
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,880
to computing saturation. So the only way

269
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,399
forward for us is either you increase

270
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,240
the slope of the yellow graph which

271
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,680
means bringing along fusion or some

272
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,040
other transformative new energy source

273
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,440
in the next 5 to 10 years seems highly

274
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:26,240
unlikely or reduce the energy required

275
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,160
for computing per bit or per bit of

276
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,560
compute right and then you can get in

277
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,959
the blue trajectory and have uh much

278
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,399
larger amount of compute possible now as

279
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,480
a society we have been doing this for a

280
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,000
long time okay if you look at this graph

281
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,079
again taken from a very nice perspective

282
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,079
by Marinara and Agura a few years ago.

283
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,959
The y-axis is again exponential scale

284
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,959
showing you the energy efficiency of

285
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,959
compute per bit or per bit operation.

286
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,480
Right? If you look at the top most

287
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:54,720
point that's eniac that was invented in

288
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,880
my department the first general purpose

289
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,480
computer made out of vacuum tubes right

290
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,279
so when used to be turned on the whole

291
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,800
of electricity of of uh uh university

292
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,040
city area of Philadelphia used to be

293
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,120
shut down just to power any right

294
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,839
comprised of vacuum tubes it used to

295
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,720
come consume about a few hundred jewles

296
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,040
per bit of energy look what happens on

297
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,640
the y-axis there's a break in the y-axis

298
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,720
before the next point which is IBM PC

299
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,320
there's a trunk transformative change in

300
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,399
the hardware technology. You move from

301
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,240
vacuum tubes to semiconductors. It's a

302
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,320
six orders of magnitude jump in the

303
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,880
computing efficiency right there. Right?

304
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,079
You went from vacuum tubes to

305
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,440
semiconductors. By that time integrated

306
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,760
circuits were realized which went to the

307
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,160
IBM PC. It was pretty clear to people

308
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,720
the game is simple now. Scale down more

309
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,920
law scaling takes over. That helps you

310
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,279
out until mid 2005 right here. And for

311
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,279
those of you who are in the computer

312
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,399
architecture field, you would know this

313
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,480
is around the time when Intel's

314
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,920
processors which are dual core, quad

315
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,720
core and all these started coming out

316
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,120
around 2005. Why? Because at a single

317
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,320
core level computing was not the speed

318
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,160
was not increasing any further.

319
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,079
Efficiencies were not getting gained. So

320
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,640
therefore the so-called architectural

321
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,120
revolution started around mid 2005 right

322
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,440
here. That that is going on all the way

323
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,560
until today. Apparently, this is also

324
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,720
the time when GPUs were introduced and

325
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,240
so-called GPU era started and GPUs

326
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,399
progressively started becoming more

327
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,320
important and CPUs started becoming less

328
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,920
and less important and today we know how

329
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,560
fortunes of Intel versus Nvidia has

330
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,079
flipped, right? And so that's because

331
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,399
GPUs have become way more relevant than

332
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,440
CPUs, right? But here we are today

333
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,920
somewhere close to 2025. If you look at

334
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,760
the compute energy per bit of Nvidia's

335
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,560
best processors, they are in the couple

336
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,560
hundred fejoules per bit. very close to

337
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,360
the thermodynamic limits that silicon

338
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,639
camass presents. Right? This is physics.

339
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,920
You can't cheat with physics. You can

340
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,320
cheat with architecture. You can cheat

341
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,240
with engineering and scaling. It very

342
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,880
hard to cheat with physics. This is

343
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,160
where we need a transformative new

344
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,920
technology to continue to increase our

345
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,839
effic energy efficiency for compute.

346
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,800
What is that? We don't know. Some people

347
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,079
say photonics, some people say quantum.

348
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,440
All kinds of names are being thrown

349
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,120
around, right? All kinds of technologies

350
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,800
are being thrown around. Uh we don't

351
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,240
know. Maybe it's completely new state

352
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,440
variable. Maybe it's completely new

353
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,600
physics. Or it could be the same

354
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,600
technology but integration of new

355
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,920
materials and devices. Right? This is

356
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,760
sort of the shortest term solution is to

357
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,440
introduce in new materials and devices

358
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,920
to enhance architectures even further.

359
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,880
And this is where our community mostly

360
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,320
sits which is design uh designing new

361
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,000
materials, devices and systems that

362
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,560
maximize bit operations per watt of

363
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,959
power while sticking to this electronics

364
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,120
platform. Right? And that is why a bunch

365
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,279
of people in our community including u

366
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,680
uh a fernas and many others in MIT are

367
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,680
focusing on new materials uh to do

368
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,440
computing much more efficiently uh and

369
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,200
not just computing but also other

370
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,800
variants of computing like generating

371
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,639
light modulating light which is the

372
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,040
photonic aspects uh that involves

373
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,600
communication and so on. So in that

374
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,839
sense uh certainly u novel optical

375
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,519
material novel materials sorry

376
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,839
lowdimensional materials both optical

377
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,320
electronic materials have sort of

378
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,920
dominated the research community. Um

379
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,920
here is a long list of those materials

380
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,040
or long u chart of many of those

381
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,279
materials. My group ends up working on

382
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,880
all of them by the way. Right. Um

383
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,440
certainly I cannot talk about all of

384
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,760
them today. Going to focus on these two

385
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,440
over here. among them I'm going to focus

386
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,199
further on uh the three nitrites okay so

387
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,440
let's try and get into it a little bit

388
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,040
further uh and try to understand where

389
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,680
this problem can be solved by three

390
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,519
nitride mater ferlectric materials so as

391
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,320
I already mentioned or alluded to in the

392
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,560
few previous slides dense integration of

393
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,519
memory and logic is necessary if you

394
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,120
look at the current computer

395
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,120
architecture including the latest and

396
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,959
greatest chips out there they are like a

397
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,480
strip mall parking lot right like you

398
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,480
would like you would see when you go to

399
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,160
Chicago or well Illinois or in the

400
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,000
middle of nowhere in the country, right?

401
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,440
They're all spread out, right? So the

402
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,040
processor cores or and the memory units

403
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,519
are all separated out. They are all

404
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,199
connected in two dimensions and the rate

405
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,279
of data transfer is limited by this two

406
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,360
dimensional connectivity or bandwidth,

407
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,680
right? And and so this basically creates

408
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,440
a traffic jam when you're trying to run

409
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,279
models with extremely large number of

410
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,440
parameters requiring extremely large

411
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,639
amounts of memory, right? So the

412
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,880
solution to this is something that has

413
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,760
been wellnown for a long time which is

414
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,959
going 3D basically New York style

415
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,560
architecture right tall skyscrapers with

416
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,160
bottom floors being the computer

417
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,160
microprocessor right the logic and all

418
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,040
the above floors being memory units that

419
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,959
store the data and now instead of one or

420
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,639
two or three elevators you have a 10,000

421
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:40,160
elevators going across those building

422
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,000
right that will lead to uh data transfer

423
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,920
rates or the bandwidth of data transfer

424
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,760
could be extremely fast you're moving

425
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,360
data from millimeter or centimeter

426
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,160
scales to micron scales when you're

427
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,600
building 3D. So there's a giant gain and

428
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,120
there's a giant gain also in the

429
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,959
bandwidth of access of data that you can

430
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,880
get. Right? So this has been the holy

431
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,959
grail or in some sense from the computer

432
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,680
architectures perspective going 3D and

433
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,680
to go 3D you need something that is back

434
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,920
end of line compatible memory. Once you

435
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,440
make the silicon secret sauce, you want

436
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,040
to make memory on top of the silicon

437
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,440
secret sauce, which means it has to be

438
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,959
compatible with silicon process. And

439
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,399
therefore, it's called back end ofline

440
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,079
compatible. Silicon is called front end

441
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,160
of line. And so back end of line

442
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,759
compatibility means it should be able to

443
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,720
sustain certain number of elements that

444
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,000
are allowed in silicon foundry

445
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,600
temperatures, reaction gases, all those

446
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,040
things should be compatible with silicon

447
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,959
processing. Right? For example, the

448
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,959
temperature limitation is about 400°C.

449
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,279
You cannot more than move more than that

450
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,959
otherwise the dopens and other layers

451
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,160
inside the silicon process get disrupted

452
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,320
and all your processes a waste. Okay. So

453
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,079
in this space there has been an intense

454
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,079
competition for memory for the past 30

455
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,800
years and several technologies have been

456
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,959
tried. Many at MIT have also made huge

457
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,560
strides in many of these technologies.

458
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,920
Right? There are four major ones. I

459
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,759
don't want to debate about all of them.

460
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,680
I'll pull up a chart later that may ri

461
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,880
up a few people but we'll talk about

462
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,120
that at that time. First one is RAM or

463
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,480
standard memorers. Second is phase

464
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,000
change RAM that Intel tried to

465
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,839
commercialize and then wrote off their

466
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
entire business for a few billions. That

467
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,480
was a couple years ago. And then there

468
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,160
is MTJ which is still under

469
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,679
commercialization has not made it into

470
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,600
mainstream right magnetic tunnel

471
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,360
junctions or ferroagnet base. So ferro

472
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,679
based technologies and the last one is

473
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,520
ferroelectric. Right? If you were to ask

474
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,520
me personally, one of the two Pharaoh

475
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,160
technologies will ultimately win out for

476
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,919
various reasons. But I would like to

477
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,440
highlight why this is a very challenging

478
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,600
problem and why it has taken so long to

479
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,480
solve. Because memory is a much more

480
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,480
brutal market than

481
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,960
transistors. For memory, the device

482
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,720
performance requirements are extremely

483
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,640
stringent. You need very low energy. You

484
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,160
need very high density. You need them to

485
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,760
be extremely fast. You need to be back

486
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,679
end offline process compatible. And you

487
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,520
need to them to be extremely reliable.

488
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,039
Getting all of these things together in

489
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,640
a single technology is extremely

490
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,120
difficult. This is why no single

491
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,200
technology is one together to date. We

492
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,360
hope the technology that I'm going to

493
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,559
show you potentially has a chance. There

494
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,840
are other competing technologies too,

495
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,000
but we are definitely betting on our

496
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,679
horse. All right. So, let's go into

497
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,840
ferro electric technology and why that

498
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,039
is so

499
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,120
special. It's not a new technology.

500
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,080
Ferro have been known for a long time.

501
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,840
The year 2022 marked 100 years of

502
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,120
ferroelect electricity. Does anybody

503
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,440
know who came up with the word

504
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,320
ferroelectric? Does everybody know Irvin

505
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,679
Schroinger? Well, he also came up with

506
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,840
the word federal, but he's known for

507
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,200
better things than federal electric,

508
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,440
right? Okay. So, he came up with the

509
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,679
word. So, it's a very old word, very old

510
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,000
uh technology. If you've taken Tokyo

511
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,600
Transit, you have used the Tokyo Transit

512
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,280
cards, they have a chip inside them that

513
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,960
actually contains this memory. So,

514
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,799
peroskite based federals have already

515
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,720
been commercialized. They have a problem

516
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,000
with scaling and they also have chemical

517
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,679
compatibility problems. They have lead

518
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,480
and bismouth. No silicon foundry wants

519
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,240
lead and bismouth in them. Also they

520
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,760
cannot be scaled below 50 nometer in

521
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,840
thickness. They self depolarized and

522
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,919
cease to exist as a ferroelectric.

523
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,679
Hafneia another or halfna based

524
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,679
ferctrics another very exciting class of

525
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,039
ferroelectrics. Professor Chima he's not

526
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,039
here right now but I met him earlier.

527
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,440
He's been working on them for a while.

528
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,600
Um they have their own problems too but

529
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,520
they have they have made it quite far in

530
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,280
terms of uh uh process control and

531
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,960
engineering. They were first discovered

532
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,880
in 2006. They're slowly trying to make

533
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,160
their way into commercialization. They

534
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,240
have other problems which I can talk

535
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,440
about later. And then the last ones

536
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,799
which were only realized as a federal in

537
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,080
2019. These are the nitride ones. They

538
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,160
also have their problems. I'm going to

539
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,440
try and show you one by one. We have

540
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,760
tried to solve or address most of these

541
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,080
problems. Okay. So what are these

542
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,600
ferroelectrics? Now these are the same

543
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,960
structure as gallium nitride or aluminum

544
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,039
nitrite. It's a woodside crystal

545
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,480
structure. I'm sure and any of you from

546
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,880
material science departments or people

547
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,720
who work with 35 materials, you know

548
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,640
about the woodside crystal structure.

549
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,960
You can have either a metal polar or a

550
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,799
nitrogen polar state and that basically

551
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,400
stores your up or down polarization of

552
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,960
this federal and therefore your memory

553
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,720
zero or memory one. Right? So it's very

554
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,160
simple as you're switching the ferrotric

555
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,919
from one polar state to other polar

556
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,360
state. All the unit cells move half all

557
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,960
the atoms moved half a unit cells up

558
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,559
half a unit cell down. That's it. And

559
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,880
the polarization flips. There are no

560
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,400
weird pathways or circling around or

561
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,799
anything like like that involved which

562
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,000
is true in many other ferctrics. Compare

563
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,559
the hysteresis loops of these

564
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,880
ferroelectrics aluminum scandium nitride

565
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,360
first reported by this group in Franhaer

566
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,520
Institute in in uh and KE University in

567
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,520
Germany. They're almost ideal square

568
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,280
shaped hysteresus loops as compared to

569
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,280
lead zirconium titanate which is you

570
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,280
know very very small and tiny in the

571
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,159
center as compared to it. But the even

572
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,159
more exciting part over here is that the

573
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,240
remnant polarization the amount of

574
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,080
charge uh remaining behind in the

575
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,880
fereral extremely large of the order of

576
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,520
100 microcoolums per centime square or

577
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,960
more. This is so much charge that it can

578
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,520
lead to some very dramatic uh

579
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,200
performance enhancements in devices uh

580
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,039
which you'll see uh as we move forward.

581
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,480
Uh by the way I should mention over here

582
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:59,200
that this is not some exotic uh material

583
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,400
that was just discovered and uh you know

584
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,919
a hard time making its way into

585
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,880
commercialization. If you all bought a

586
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,360
phone after 2020 or 2021 it's likely in

587
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,799
your phone as a PZO electric bar filter.

588
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,159
So the PZO electric properties of these

589
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,880
materials are already commercialized.

590
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,520
Now we are trying to commercialize or

591
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,039
discover and report the memory storage

592
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,120
or data storage properties of this

593
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,240
material.

594
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,760
Okay. All right. There are many other

595
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,280
advantages. I'll go over them very

596
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,520
briefly. We have summarized them on this

597
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,039
review article. It's a full class of

598
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,960
materials. It's not just an isolated

599
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,919
material. Aluminum scandium variant is

600
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,600
the most mature successful one. But

601
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,200
there is gallium scandium nitrite, zinc,

602
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,679
magnesium oxide, aluminum boron nitrite,

603
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,080
aluminum

604
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:42,799
nitride. The list goes on, right? Um the

605
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,360
key features are the following. Large

606
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,120
coarse fields, large remnant

607
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,960
polarizations.

608
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,280
Okay. A second very important property,

609
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,360
extremely high stability. You cook this

610
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,120
thing up to thousand degrees CC, keep it

611
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,200
for days, bring it back down, the data

612
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,200
just stays there. Nothing happens to it.

613
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,799
Very rare property, not there in most

614
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,919
systems, right? Extremely important for

615
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,280
data storage, information storage in

616
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,880
high temperature environments, which

617
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,799
I'll talk about towards the end if time

618
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,720
permits. Finally, it's also one of those

619
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,480
materials which has low dialectric

620
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,200
constants combined with the ferro

621
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,360
electricity. means it's uh you to switch

622
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,760
it the energy required required is very

623
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,440
low. Last couple points I'll mention

624
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,640
it's a unifiasic material. It only

625
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,159
exists in one phase the woodside phase.

626
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,679
Normally in many other ferroelectrics

627
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,919
you have to compete for phases which is

628
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,679
a problem if you want phase homogeneity

629
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,280
over entire wafers. And uh finally this

630
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,280
material is fully back end of line

631
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,120
compatible. You can deposit these films

632
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,559
even at 100°C or even at lower

633
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,559
temperatures. The Japanese do it at a

634
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,960
room temperature and they turn out to be

635
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,159
perfectly

636
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,720
ferroelectric. Okay. So it's also done

637
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,000
in a process that is quite friendly and

638
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,000
used in industry at scale. We do

639
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,280
sputtering of this. Certainly most other

640
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,200
groups also do sputtering. But there are

641
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,120
also groups that do MBE MOCBD of this

642
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,280
matter. Even PLLD pulse laser

643
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,520
deposition. I'm hearing reports that

644
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,919
aluminina uh atomic layer deposition or

645
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,159
ALD also works but we'll see. We haven't

646
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,400
seen any conclusive reports here yet.

647
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,159
But you can deposit on full 6-in wafers.

648
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,640
We can we are poor. We can only afford

649
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,200
6-in tools. So that's the maximum we can

650
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,840
grow up to. But there are there are

651
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,080
companies out there that can uh do this

652
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,520
up to 12 in, right? And so certainly

653
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,960
it's scalable outside the university

654
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,960
into actual commercial flaps.

655
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,640
Okay. The substrates are usually uh

656
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,559
silicon wafers, sapphire wafers or

657
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,159
silicon carbide wafers, whatever wafer

658
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,240
you want. The typical preferred

659
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,720
substrate is hexagonal crystal plane.

660
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,240
Symmetry is preferred right. Uh we can

661
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,000
do films all the way from centimeter by

662
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,960
centimeter to full 6 inch wafers.

663
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,720
Thickness is from five to two microns.

664
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,559
Uh temperature range of our temperature

665
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,640
range of differs between 250 to 500 C

666
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,000
depending on the

667
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,159
application. Okay. Let me go to the

668
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,320
first application of the memory device

669
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,440
application of these uh ferro which is

670
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,440
the ferroelectric field effect

671
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,280
transistors. Sper electrics as a whole

672
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,120
have several device applications that

673
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,720
few of them are shown on the screen over

674
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,080
here. I won't be able to go through all

675
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,400
of them. This is the classic or

676
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,159
conventional femorry where you have a

677
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,159
ferroelectric capacitor connected to a

678
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,600
transistor which senses out the current.

679
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,640
This is a ferroelectric field effect

680
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,960
transistor where the ferroelectric is uh

681
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,480
direct contact with the semiconductor is

682
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,440
the gate dialectric in direct contact

683
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,799
with the semiconductor. Okay. So that

684
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,559
moves to me to the second part of the

685
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,080
talk. So naturally if you have a

686
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,080
transistor you need a semiconductor

687
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,480
channel. This semiconductor channel in

688
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,840
our case is 2D materials. And so the

689
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,159
question is why do I care about it over

690
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,080
here? The short answer is half of my

691
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,600
group works on 2D materials. Other half

692
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,200
works on aluminum scanning nitride. So

693
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,279
combine the two. That's a perfectly

694
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,120
wrong answers. That's not how you're

695
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,480
supposed to do research right. There's

696
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,760
actually a deep fundamental reason

697
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,799
behind picking these two materials as a

698
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,880
combination. But let me highlight the

699
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,159
advantages of 2D semiconductors. They

700
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,679
are potentially back end of line

701
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,880
compatible. You can transfer them or

702
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,880
directly grow them on wafer. Uh uh they

703
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,480
can be extremely high quality as uh at

704
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,159
very small thicknesses without the need

705
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,679
for epidoxy. This is important. Most 35

706
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,360
semiconductors are going to need epidox.

707
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,360
2D materials not need epidoxy. This is

708
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,120
going to be their main advantage for

709
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,720
future integration for commercialization

710
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,720
purposes. And this the very thin channel

711
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,919
of the 2D materials can mean it can they

712
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,240
can support or you can induce

713
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,679
electrostatically large carrier density

714
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,159
which will lead to very low resistances

715
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,320
and therefore very high speeds of

716
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:34,000
operation. Um if you want to take my

717
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,559
perspective unfiltered perspective on

718
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,360
the future of 2D semiconductors

719
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,080
um we've wrote a perspective article um

720
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,440
u last year on it. Uh we have written it

721
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,640
quite critically in both domains

722
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,480
electronics and photonics. You're

723
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,480
welcome to take a look at it. Again I

724
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,760
won't have time to go into the details

725
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,240
of why 2D why not 2D in today's talk. Uh

726
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,679
we've also written an article on 2D

727
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,600
ferroelectrics and ferroelectric

728
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,559
semiconductors. A large number of 2D

729
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,679
materials have now found to be

730
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,440
ferroctctors. There's a lot of

731
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,240
excitement over there too. I encourage

732
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,840
you to see that article. But the

733
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,520
argument of why you want to combine

734
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,760
aluminum scandium nitride with 2D

735
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,480
channels actually came from a paper more

736
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,559
than 22 23 years ago now written in n

737
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,440
EDL. My students don't like to read

738
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,120
these journals. because they have very

739
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,320
low impact factor they tell me right

740
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,720
they only want to read nature and

741
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,720
science which are mostly fake

742
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,080
but but

743
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,400
nonetheless there are there are gems

744
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,840
hidden in these journals right and there

745
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:35,200
was a gem written by TPMA about 22 years

746
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,840
ago as to why is a non-volatile feat

747
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,520
still elusive was a purely theory paper

748
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,080
and he basically outlined with the help

749
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,880
of two equations that if you want to

750
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,720
have data preservation inside an FAT

751
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,799
You want a low depolarization field EDP

752
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,279
and you also want a low rate of loss of

753
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,520
polarization which is DP over DT. And to

754
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,559
achieve that you want a high CIS which

755
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,200
is interfacial state capacitors in the

756
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:03,159
semiconductor. And you in the

757
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,360
ferroelectric you want large EC and low

758
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:08,080
K. This means you need thin

759
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,080
semiconductor channels and large EC and

760
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,000
low K means they are possible with

761
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,240
aluminum scandium nitride. In 2002,

762
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,559
neither 2D materials were known nor all

763
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,240
scan was known. In 2020, when we started

764
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,240
this research, we immediately identified

765
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,080
this combination and went to DARPA and

766
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,159
they took the bet on a very unlikely

767
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,400
research such as this and they funded

768
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:30,720
us, right? And so that sort of uh

769
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,480
started a lot of this stuff. Okay. Um so

770
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,400
we we went ahead and started making

771
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,960
these devices. The early devices were on

772
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,559
quite thick materials such as uh 100

773
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,880
nanometers of thick aluminum scandium

774
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,640
nitride grown on platinum which is also

775
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,799
sputtered. You can do platinum. You can

776
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,240
do aluminum. We can do various other

777
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,919
metallic electrodes. They have to be

778
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,159
hexagonal phase. Platinum is templated

779
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,919
111. Therefore woodite aluminum scanning

780
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,840
nitrate grows very well on it. This is

781
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,600
approximately 100 nanometers thick. You

782
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,440
made transistor devices. They had very

783
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,799
nice hysteresis loops almost square

784
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,679
shaped. I should mention these

785
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,360
hysteresis loops now are in current and

786
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:05,200
voltage not polarization electric field.

787
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,159
So you can actually sense them out and

788
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,320
program them in circuits. It's very

789
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:11,760
important. Okay. Um again these devices

790
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,000
look extremely well in terms of

791
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,600
switching numerous times storing data

792
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,600
for a very long time. I'm only showing

793
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,760
you 10^ 5 seconds over here but we have

794
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,000
gone through months now without loss of

795
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,840
data which is extremely good. If you

796
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,520
normalize the memory window of these

797
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,520
devices to other competing technologies

798
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,200
including that of Hafnea and silicon,

799
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,559
this sort of wins out in many respects.

800
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,039
This is again old data. This has only

801
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,559
become better over time. Certainly 2D

802
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,120
materials are now scalable. Professor

803
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,200
Palasios and various others have grown

804
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,120
these materials over wafer scales. They

805
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,640
have also grown it at b compatible

806
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,640
temperatures. So all this makes it very

807
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,240
appealing. Certainly we have not grown

808
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,399
them at b compatible temperatures but

809
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,919
professor redwing who is a two three

810
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,440
hours drive away from us at Penn State

811
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,360
she grows these films over sapphire

812
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,200
wafers. We can transfer whole wafers of

813
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,279
this material onto wafers of aluminum

814
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,679
scandium nitride and make hundreds and

815
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,200
hundreds of devices and then you can get

816
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,279
uh some very nice performing

817
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,640
transistors. These transistors u u uh

818
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,679
can be reduced in their operating

819
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,520
voltages. For instance, um if you in

820
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,039
reduce the thickness of the aluminum

821
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,440
scandium nitrite, the operating voltage

822
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,039
reduces. If you increase the scandium

823
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,799
concentration, the coarser field reduces

824
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,000
and therefore the operating voltage also

825
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,919
reduces. You can see a comparison of a

826
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,919
uh aluminum scanium nitrate feed with

827
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,640
compared to a silicon oxide with similar

828
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,360
thickness as silicon oxide uh feed has

829
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,760
about a few hundred times lower current

830
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,360
uh uh even at larger uh uh sweep range

831
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,039
of gate voltage. So this highly

832
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,080
nonlinear behavior comes from the ferro

833
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,559
electricity of the aluminum scanium

834
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,640
nitrite. Again just to show you can make

835
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,000
nanocale devices really shrink down the

836
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,840
channel lens. You don't really see any

837
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,120
effect in the transistor performance.

838
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,279
You can measure hundreds of these

839
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,120
devices. They can have very large memory

840
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,200
window and on-state conductivity very

841
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,360
important for fast operation. You can

842
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,720
partially polarize these ferroelectrics

843
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,679
and if you can partially polarize the

844
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,279
ferroelectrics uh you can partially

845
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,200
change the conductance of the

846
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,039
semiconducting channel which means you

847
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,440
can potentiate it and depress it just

848
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,919
like an artificial neuron. Again people

849
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,240
who are interested in using hardware

850
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,919
implementations of uh neurons for

851
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,360
neuromorphic computing. This is a great

852
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,520
avenue or people who just want to use

853
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,240
these devices in analog memory. This

854
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,880
would be a great approach to that. We

855
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,640
have published several more works on FET

856
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,399
devices or field effect transfer devices

857
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,000
out of aluminum scanium nitride and 2D

858
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,000
materials. I don't have the time to go

859
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,080
over all of them but I'll just mention

860
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,399
them. We have made them using tungsten

861
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,399
dicelenide wherein we can also get very

862
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,200
high onstate current density. Again the

863
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,880
ferroelectric introduces very large

864
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,559
carrier density which means the on-state

865
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,720
conduct conductance or current density

866
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,760
can be very large. Similarly, the

867
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,679
channel resistance can drop

868
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,960
significantly if you have a very highly

869
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,399
doped channel. And uh we've also

870
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,919
demonstrated the negative capacitance

871
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,240
effect. This was work actually the Sri

872
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,000
Krishna Coled who's now in Palasio's

873
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,520
group. And so we have uh we've

874
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,399
demonstrated all the major phenomena

875
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,520
that you would get uh using uh by by

876
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,399
pairing ferroelectrics with a novel

877
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,840
semiconductor. So with that I'm going to

878
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,399
switch gears and move to a different

879
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,200
type of federal memory device namely the

880
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:18,000
federal diode memory device. Okay, this

881
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,279
is very similar to a memorister device.

882
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,360
This does not have three terminals now.

883
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,640
It has only two terminals. This does not

884
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,159
need a semiconductor

885
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,840
anymore. So the ferroelectric diode

886
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,600
device is nothing but a sandwich of

887
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,320
aluminum scandium nitride or it could be

888
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,440
any other

889
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,440
ferroelectric in between two metallic

890
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,519
electrodes with an interfacial layer

891
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,720
which is a non-ferctric insulator. It

892
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,360
could be an oxide insulator, it could be

893
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,120
another nitride, what have you. Right

894
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,480
now the way this device works is

895
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,399
depending on the polarization of the

896
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,640
ferroelectric the conductance or the

897
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,640
leakage through the ferroelectric is

898
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,000
widely different by orders of magnitude.

899
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,880
Right? And so this gives it the

900
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,200
memoristive or resistive memory

901
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,720
phenomenon. Right? Not only that it is

902
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,919
also highly nonlinear and highly

903
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,200
asymmetric. Therefore the diode like

904
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,600
behavior. This is very advantageous for

905
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,880
various reasons. One it becomes a

906
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,720
voltage switch device rather than a

907
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,240
current switcher. A lot of the RAM and

908
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,919
phase change RAM are current switch

909
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,279
devices. You are actually passing a

910
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,200
certain amount of current basically

911
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,440
jewel heating the the thing until the

912
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,279
filament forms or breaks, right? You

913
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,120
don't need that over here. So this is

914
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,600
much less power consuming as compared to

915
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,880
RAM and PC RAM. PC RAM is already sort

916
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:29,679
of dying out slowly. RAM is still uh

917
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,840
used in some circles but uh scaling it

918
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,640
is going to become a big challenge.

919
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,120
Okay. Uh let's see. Okay. uh this ferro

920
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,159
diode effect or fed effect as we call it

921
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,919
is uh has been shown in other uh

922
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,519
ferroelectrics too. For example, in

923
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,519
Haphnneia people have shown it a few

924
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,720
years ago. Uh professor Chima just

925
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,279
showed me he was working on similar

926
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,799
effects in his his films as well as this

927
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,799
2D ferctrics like copper indium

928
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,200
phosphorus sulfide have shown the same

929
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,440
effect as well. So it's it's widely

930
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,600
known now. It's not something uh uh

931
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,919
obscure or absurd or one-off thing that

932
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,440
we are seeing. Um compared to the

933
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,159
standard resistive memory again like

934
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,240
phase change RAM or RAM which are this

935
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,880
quite symmetric and linear devices this

936
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,360
is highly nonlinear and highly

937
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,360
asymmetric. This means that unlike any

938
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,960
of these devices which would require a

939
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,960
pairing or selector transistor in the

940
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,559
underlying silicon hardware you don't

941
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,559
quite need it over here. This reduces

942
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,240
the hardware complexity quite a bit and

943
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,399
the hardware overhead you need in the

944
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,919
underlying silicon making it way more

945
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:32,320
energy efficient in terms of in-memory

946
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,919
compute or compute inmemory operations.

947
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,919
uh just to give you a very simple

948
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,440
illustration or example over there. You

949
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,720
could build an architecture known as

950
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,159
turnary content addressable memory or

951
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,000
TCAM. Right? This is a typical

952
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,120
architecture used in searches. Like if

953
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,960
you want to do search and pattern

954
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,640
matching over large bodies of data, you

955
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,320
would do this. If you wanted to do it in

956
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,480
silicon semos, you would need two SRAMM

957
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,519
cells, which means 16 transistors. If

958
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,279
you want to do it with standard

959
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,880
resistive memory devices, you'll need

960
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,559
two two memory, which are those

961
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,159
resistive elements that you see, and two

962
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,519
transistors. But if you wanted to do it

963
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,840
in ferro diodes, you'll just need two

964
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,760
ferctric diodes. And depending on how

965
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,079
you polarize them, you can get charge

966
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,679
discharge or don't care states over

967
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,359
here. Again, I'm happy to go over the

968
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,200
details of this later on. You can also

969
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,440
refer to the paper if you're interested.

970
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,839
So then if you project that into the

971
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,760
search delay versus cell area required,

972
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,760
you can see that it wins out over all

973
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,200
the other uh memory technologies that

974
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,040
you want to use for search and pattern

975
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,639
matching applications. Certainly the

976
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,040
energy consumption also drops by a

977
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,399
significant amount. this concept uh won

978
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,240
the Bell Labs prize a couple of years

979
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,760
ago uh which prompted us to think

980
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,159
further into commercializing this whole

981
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,679
area. Naturally, you can shrink down the

982
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,079
dimensions of the ferroelectric quite a

983
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,000
bit. When we first started this field, a

984
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,679
lot of people would not believe that you

985
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,200
can scale down the ferroelectrics to

986
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,480
such small thicknesses and maintain

987
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,399
ferctricity. The oxide community was

988
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,399
hellbent on believing themselves that u

989
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:54,639
uh this material was refused to remain

990
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,000
as a ferroelectric when you scaled it

991
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,119
down to below 10 nanometers in

992
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,720
thickness. Turns out even at 5

993
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,280
nanometers these diodes work pretty

994
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,359
well. Um I have data showing they can

995
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,599
this material itself can switch at about

996
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,680
2 volts or so as well. I can share that

997
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,440
later. You can also have program into

998
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,599
multiple memory states like about 32

999
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,520
states over here. Very linearly you can

1000
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,760
program it and deprogram it. Again very

1001
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,640
useful for synaptic behavior in

1002
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,640
neuromorphic computing. Here are some

1003
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,320
other data showing that when the field

1004
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,920
started several years ago, people were

1005
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,240
making a micron thick devices which are

1006
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,960
not even on the scale. But then in like

1007
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,680
five short years uh give or add another

1008
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,400
year thanks to co you can shrink it down

1009
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,680
to uh we have managed to shrink down the

1010
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,960
um device thickness to about 5

1011
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,560
nanometers and the important thing is

1012
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,160
even at 5 nanometers in thickness the

1013
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,240
remnant polarization of this material

1014
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,920
stays quite close to the bulk remnant

1015
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,119
polarization. This is an important

1016
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,560
parameter showing that uh uh you can

1017
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,160
truly scale the material and preserve

1018
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,400
its fer electricity at the same levels

1019
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,000
at bulk. There are many important

1020
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,000
challenges to solve over there. Namely,

1021
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,880
reducing the course of field at small

1022
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,160
voltages which we'll talk about. Okay, I

1023
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,000
want to mention a couple more things.

1024
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,680
This has now been scaled up. You can

1025
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,760
definitely make crossbar arrays instead

1026
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,680
of individual devices. We are making

1027
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,720
full 2 to 10 kilobyte chips. Here's a

1028
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,480
4in wafer of 10 kilob chips. uh we are

1029
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,920
dicing them out, wire bonding and

1030
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,320
packaging them and sending them to

1031
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:22,079
companies for testing. I'll tell you why

1032
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,240
they would want such low memory uh u um

1033
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,400
sort of density chips uh in a few

1034
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,920
slides. But even in the bad clean room

1035
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,599
that we have which uh you know all

1036
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,079
genistic clean rooms are bad but ours is

1037
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,480
way worse than yours right yours is much

1038
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,359
newer too and much better maintained. So

1039
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,280
anyways you can see that even in the few

1040
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,480
hundred devices that we measured the

1041
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,720
yield is about 99.4% 4% at 10 micron

1042
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,119
device sizes right done using you know

1043
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,000
the mask aligner

1044
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:50,000
photoiththography and then the

1045
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,920
distribution of switching voltage is

1046
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,839
what is important to note if if you try

1047
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,320
to compare resistive RAM or phase change

1048
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:59,359
RAM memory this distribution is much

1049
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,440
wide of the order of a couple of volts

1050
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,599
we're talking about switching voltage

1051
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,359
distribution under a 100 molt or so

1052
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,160
which means excellent uniformity of the

1053
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,000
material over large area wafers right

1054
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,440
and again the on-off ratio has more

1055
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,400
distribution But that is because of the

1056
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,960
interfacial layer uh you made using ALD

1057
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,560
which is not ideal. Um the next question

1058
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,079
we get is can you really scale these

1059
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,560
devices down to extremely small

1060
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,000
nanometric dimensions and maintain phys

1061
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,800
lateral dimensions and maintain their

1062
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,960
memory performance. Turns out yes. This

1063
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,280
graph shows you that 50 micron and 50

1064
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,160
nanometer devices have an area scaling

1065
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,000
of about a million times. But then if

1066
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,599
you take that area scaling and convert

1067
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,520
into current density actually all the

1068
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,040
graphs overlap on top of each other.

1069
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,880
This shows you it's a hyper ununiform

1070
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,880
material from the micron scale down to

1071
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,960
just a few tens of nanometers. This

1072
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,400
would be unthinkable in case of RAM for

1073
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,400
example where you are forming filament

1074
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,680
and the ferin formation becomes more

1075
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,560
stochastic the smaller dimensions you go

1076
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:58,640
to. Okay. All right. The last thing that

1077
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,079
people ding us upon all the time is

1078
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,440
you're never going to be able to make a

1079
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,280
ferroelectric switch billions and

1080
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,320
billions of times because that has

1081
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,560
always been the problem in

1082
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,560
ferroelectrics. In the oxide fereralis

1083
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,400
people have overcome it after 8 10 years

1084
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,400
of work but here there's a huge

1085
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,079
advantage that we are trying to that we

1086
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,079
were not exploiting so far which is the

1087
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,320
large polarization if the total

1088
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,440
polarization is 100 microous perm square

1089
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,680
you don't have to switch the full

1090
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,599
polarization from top to bottom you have

1091
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,720
to only switch a fraction of it if you

1092
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,280
switch only a fraction of this

1093
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,079
polarization you get your uh your memory

1094
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,520
readout quite well and if you do so if

1095
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,839
you partially polarize the aluminance

1096
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,000
scandium nitride you can actually reach

1097
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,400
cycling enduranceances is exceeding a

1098
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,839
billion, right? We have data showing in

1099
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,480
some devices we have data showing

1100
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,079
exceeding 10 billion as well. And this

1101
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,560
is still being done at device dimensions

1102
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,720
of about 10 microns or so. These are the

1103
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,160
smallest device dimensions. We hope that

1104
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,760
when we start doing endurance

1105
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,280
measurements on even smaller dimensions

1106
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,280
like 100 nanometer, 50 nanometer

1107
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,320
diameter devices, we should be able to

1108
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,920
break uh uh the the sort of thresholds

1109
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,440
that are required for commercialization

1110
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,160
which is typically around 10 to the 11

1111
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,760
10 to the 12. Okay. So what's the memory

1112
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,920
landscape look like? Memory is a very

1113
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,359
tight landscape. There are many

1114
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,760
parameters on people which people

1115
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,160
evaluate memory. Um again I'm I've

1116
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,240
listed many of this. This table can rile

1117
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,839
up a lot of people because of the

1118
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,240
numbers. I've tried to go with very

1119
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,160
conservative numbers over here. Um some

1120
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,320
people tell I'm giving too much leeway

1121
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:26,720
to other technologies over here uh given

1122
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,119
what they offer commercially. But you

1123
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,040
can see that the Alcan ferro diodes is

1124
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,520
kind of beating all of the technologies

1125
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,119
in most metrics. Right. The endurance

1126
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,960
one is still something we are working

1127
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,880
on. We expect that to even cross 10 to

1128
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,359
the 10, 10 to the 11 in the coming

1129
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,920
years. HBM DM is the volatile memory

1130
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,160
currently used in most high-end GPUs or

1131
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,839
Nvidia chip if you will. If you want to

1132
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,960
compare federal diode memory to

1133
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:54,240
commercially available RAM from TSMC or

1134
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,839
Skywater again on most metrics, we are

1135
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,200
we have we have beaten these

1136
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:59,200
commercially available technologies with

1137
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,400
the exception of voltage and this is

1138
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,480
something that we are trying to solve

1139
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,000
now. uh we are hoping with the help of

1140
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,280
Intel and others we'll be able to

1141
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,200
address that too in a year year and a

1142
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,960
half of time and we'll be ready for

1143
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,920
prime time commercialization at that

1144
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,760
time but even without that there is a

1145
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,760
particular application where this

1146
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,920
material could have uh could could use

1147
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,440
uh this uh memory technology right now

1148
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,839
and that is an extreme environment

1149
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,680
computing. Why? Because as you can see

1150
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,440
from this chart, this is one of the few

1151
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,200
thin film ferroelectrics, probably the

1152
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,280
only one available that is extremely

1153
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,359
stable at elevated temperatures. Now,

1154
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,839
why do you need to store data in those

1155
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,680
temperatures? There's a whole field of

1156
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,680
electronics in extreme environments. We

1157
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,880
wrote a review article on that recently

1158
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,160
and there are several material

1159
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,200
challenges over there in various

1160
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,240
domains, packaging, interconnects,

1161
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,079
logic, inst uh you know gate,

1162
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,839
dialectrics, memory, etc. The memory

1163
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,440
problem is particularly severe because

1164
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,599
there has never been a commercially

1165
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,599
available nonvolatile memory that can

1166
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,160
operate more than 250C. Today, if you go

1167
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,640
in the market and ask someone, I want a

1168
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,880
nonvolatile memory to store data at

1169
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,440
upwards of 250°C, they'll tell you it's

1170
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,240
not possible. The best available is a

1171
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,720
flash memory by Texas Instruments or

1172
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,079
some other small companies that also

1173
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,800
needs to be refreshed every 100

1174
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,359
milliseconds at 250°C. So there's no way

1175
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,560
to reliably store data today at elevated

1176
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,839
temperatures. So and there are many

1177
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,480
applications for that. I don't need to

1178
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:27,200
go into it but many defense and nuclear

1179
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,640
power applications but also in oil oil

1180
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,240
and gas exploration automotive

1181
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,800
industrial electronics and so on

1182
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,240
certainly space applications. Now if you

1183
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,720
want to think about just logic

1184
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,160
transistors they have been quite well

1185
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,359
achieved or solved at elevated

1186
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,880
temperatures like silicon carbide

1187
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,119
technology is pretty mature over there.

1188
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,960
NASA has worked on it for several years,

1189
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,119
right? And they have 800° CCelsius

1190
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,960
transistors working quite well. This is

1191
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,680
how some of NASA's processors that they

1192
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,119
wanted to use on Venus look like they

1193
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,920
don't have too many transistors as you

1194
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,280
can see about,000 to 10,000 transistors.

1195
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,040
This is a few years old, but about

1196
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,760
thousand to 10,000 transistors is what

1197
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,240
they have on silicon carbide dies. And

1198
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,720
most of the transistors are used as

1199
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:08,400
SRAMM volatile memory leaving extremely

1200
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,960
few number of transistors to do actual

1201
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,480
compute. So in this case, if you had a

1202
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,000
nonvolatile memory device where you

1203
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,920
stored the data and forgot about it and

1204
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,760
only just went and accessed it when you

1205
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,839
needed it, the amount of computing power

1206
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,240
could grow by leaps and bounds at

1207
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,839
elevated temperatures. And the prime

1208
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,560
such application to begin with would be

1209
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:29,520
jet engines um uh and and downhole

1210
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,599
drilling exploration in in uh in in oil

1211
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,040
and gas

1212
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:35,839
exploration. Um and so we have now

1213
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,079
tested ferctric diodes, the same concept

1214
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:40,400
that I showed you a few slides ago. It

1215
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,599
works extremely well up to 600°C. I have

1216
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,880
unpublished data that is going up to

1217
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:47,280
800°C. You can see the resistive memory

1218
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,520
effect sustained quite well up to 600°C.

1219
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,880
The on-off ratio drops a bit, but we

1220
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,800
have now used interfacial layer

1221
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,040
engineering to also bump this up to

1222
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,640
about 50 or so. At 800°C, you can see

1223
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,400
very clear ferroelectric stitching. In

1224
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,599
fact, fer electricity becomes better in

1225
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,880
this material because the course of

1226
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,160
field reduces as you increase

1227
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,240
temperature and you see extremely sharp

1228
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,839
uh ferroelectric displacement currents

1229
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,079
coming up in pund measurements even at

1230
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:13,839
elevated temperatures. Right? You can

1231
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,200
keep store the memory state and read it

1232
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:19,119
out millions of times at

1233
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,119
600°C. You can keep it for hours. Here

1234
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,920
is a 60-hour data. We have now tested

1235
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,599
with AFRL for several weeks. The that

1236
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,119
data is not included here. Again, no

1237
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,000
change in the memory state after weeks

1238
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,359
at elevated temperature like 600 C. And

1239
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,880
then if you compare it with the compete

1240
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,880
any competing technologies out there,

1241
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,760
there's almost nothing out there. There

1242
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,800
was one data point out here. This one

1243
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,480
over here, this is platinum wires which

1244
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,520
are made and u which are broken and

1245
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,359
resoldered by passing current at

1246
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,000
elevated temperatures. They can only

1247
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:52,079
last a couple hundred cycles at the very

1248
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,079
most, right? and they can only store

1249
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,400
data only for a certain amount of time

1250
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,760
as well. So really only this federal

1251
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,480
memory technology that is the only

1252
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,079
viable one out there uh at elevated

1253
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,079
temperatures and now with our new data

1254
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,000
we have also pushed this up over here.

1255
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,240
So it becomes pretty much the most

1256
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
dominant technology. I should mention

1257
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,599
that this can also work at very low

1258
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,599
temperatures up to 12 Kelvin. So all the

1259
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,760
way from 12 Kelvin to 1200 Kelvin it

1260
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,359
works out pretty fine. It also works

1261
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,960
quite well under gamma radiation

1262
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,040
exposure. This was done with Sandia

1263
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,400
National Lab. And in the last couple of

1264
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,880
minutes that I had, I want to mention

1265
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,440
that aluminum scandium nitride is also

1266
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,440
very well lattis matched or quasi well

1267
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,040
latis matched to silicon carbide because

1268
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,000
aluminum nitride is extremely well latis

1269
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,000
matched. Aluminum scanning nitride is uh

1270
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,079
um reasonably latis matched to silicon

1271
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,480
carbide. So you can grow on it directly

1272
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,319
and you can switch uh capacitive

1273
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,000
devices, ferroelectric capacitor devices

1274
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:46,960
on silicon carbide all the way up to

1275
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,359
1000 C, no problem. Um you'll see as you

1276
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,960
keep increasing the temperature the

1277
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,440
number of cycles they'll switch before

1278
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,800
they fail starts reducing slightly but

1279
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,480
that's not a huge deal because at

1280
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,240
elevated temperature mostly you want

1281
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,440
reliable read operations and reliable

1282
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,280
write operations over millions of times

1283
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,520
okay that brings me to the end and I

1284
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,119
want to make a point that if you look at

1285
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,520
high temperature compute technology or

1286
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,720
in general any extreme environment

1287
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:12,400
compute these are sort of the current

1288
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,880
technologies available at elevated

1289
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,400
temperatures 250C silicon high silicon

1290
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,640
300 00 C SOI technology and 900C NASA's

1291
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,400
JFAT and if you compare them to the

1292
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,040
mainstream silicon technology this is

1293
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,480
more law line basically we are stuck in

1294
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:30,480
the 2000s or late 90s as compared to the

1295
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,000
high high temperature uh electronics

1296
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,680
technology is concerned that because

1297
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,280
thermodynamics takes over at some point

1298
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,440
and you can't just arbitrarily scale

1299
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,280
things and expect it to operate in the

1300
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,960
same reliable fashion as you get it to

1301
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,880
do at low temperatures or at room

1302
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,560
temperatures right and so the only way

1303
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,720
forward if you want to augment computing

1304
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,480
at elevated temperatures is you will

1305
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,520
have to do memory enhanced computing and

1306
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,040
therefore having a reliable non-volatile

1307
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,359
memory at elevated temperatures become

1308
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,599
very important in this niche but very

1309
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,520
important area of electronics. So that

1310
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,520
I'd like to end and mention that

1311
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,800
aluminum scanny n is a very promising

1312
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,359
back end of line compatible

1313
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,839
ferroelectric material. The resistive

1314
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,440
ferro diode memory is quite uh promising

1315
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:11,839
for commercialization. I already shown

1316
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,480
you some 2 to 10 kilobyte chips. You can

1317
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:17,200
also made very nice 2D FE feds with it

1318
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,119
or 2D channel FETSS. The key scientific

1319
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,440
challenge is reducing course of field at

1320
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,200
small thicknesses and it's also very

1321
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,359
viable candidate for high temperature

1322
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,800
extreme environment nonvortile memory.

1323
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,480
With that I would like to thank you all

1324
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,240
again. Thanks Fernas for inviting and

1325
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,240
I'm happy to take any questions. Thank

1326
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,240
you.

1327
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:40,079
Thanks for a great talk. We have time

1328
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,480
for a few questions. Um any question

1329
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,480
from the audience?

1330
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,440
Uh thank you a very impressive talk. I

1331
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:52,720
have two questions. Uh first one is um

1332
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,760
regarding the uh scalability and uh

1333
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:58,960
energy consumption. Could you briefly

1334
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,760
compare the file electric fat and ferro

1335
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:04,480
diode and in which real application

1336
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,760
which one is better and second one is u

1337
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,720
can we also use lscan for capacitor

1338
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,640
based memories or are there any uh

1339
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,280
difficulties or challenges behind it?

1340
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,440
Thank you. Okay, great. Um first

1341
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,000
question is can you compare these two

1342
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,640
devices in terms of energy the top one

1343
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,800
over here and the bottom one? Um my

1344
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:28,560
sense is it it depends on the

1345
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,280
architecture a lot right for instance um

1346
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:33,520
if you want to think about the first

1347
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,680
device a three terminal device if you

1348
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,680
want to at a circuit level it's always

1349
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,240
going to have more capacitors more

1350
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:43,119
parasitic capacitors because of the

1351
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:46,160
capacitive nature of the gate in the

1352
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,400
transistor. So in terms of reading and

1353
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,000
in terms of reducing the uh terms of

1354
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,960
ultimate frequency of operation that is

1355
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:57,280
a limiting factor uh in this is a simple

1356
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,440
two terminal device. So if you want to

1357
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,920
compare again at a circuit level in

1358
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,560
terms of read energies and read speeds

1359
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,960
this is going to present much lower LCR

1360
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,400
or parasitic LCR and therefore the

1361
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,200
energy consumption is going to be much

1362
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,960
lower than the than the above one. Okay.

1363
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,920
But there are also other challenges.

1364
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,640
That one is actually much better because

1365
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,480
it has a semiconductor channel whose

1366
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,119
on-off ratio can be arbitrarily

1367
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,960
increased or jacked up. Over here you're

1368
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,640
kind of limited by that. I mean you have

1369
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,920
to do some engineering to get on-off

1370
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:32,720
ratios of 10 ^ 5 6 and so on. There you

1371
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,400
get 10^ the 7 10 the 8 quite easily

1372
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,680
right and it has a non-destructive read

1373
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,200
already built in. Even this one has a

1374
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,640
non-destructive read but at extremely

1375
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,319
low voltages we don't know what's going

1376
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,920
to happen. Right? Right. So there are

1377
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:43,760
advantages and disadvantages. The other

1378
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,160
advantage this one has is very easy to

1379
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,280
make and fabricate in back end of line.

1380
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,520
It's just a simple three layer

1381
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:52,079
structure. That one always involves the

1382
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,440
semiconductor dialectric interface. One

1383
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,960
heck of an interface if you ask the

1384
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,280
semiconductor industry. The hardest one

1385
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,920
to optimize typically right. So always

1386
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,160
more challenging. And the second one can

1387
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,760
you use aluminum scan matter as a simple

1388
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:06,160
ferlectric capacitor memory? Yes, you

1389
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,319
can. And like all ferroelectric

1390
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,760
capacitors, you can certainly use it and

1391
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:11,760
then switch it like a ferroelectric

1392
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,880
capacitor like I showed over here.

1393
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,480
Right? When you switch it like a

1394
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,280
ferrolectric capacitor, it's called a

1395
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,800
pund pd

1396
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,559
measurement positive up negative down

1397
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,319
when you are switching up you get this

1398
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,520
ferctric current and you then you again

1399
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:25,359
switch up there is no current because

1400
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,599
ferctctor switching has already happened

1401
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:29,200
you switch it down you get current and

1402
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,160
you get no current. So based on this

1403
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,079
this current signal intensity and and

1404
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,720
the uh direction you can tell whether

1405
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,800
memory zero memory one certainly you can

1406
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,720
do it but there's a problem then how

1407
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,640
much can you scale it because when you

1408
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:44,079
scale below a certain dimension the

1409
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,079
displacement current is going to scale

1410
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,040
with the volume of the ferroelectric at

1411
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,640
some point it's going to become

1412
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,720
comparable to a leakage current so you

1413
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,640
cannot really scale it down that much

1414
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,960
unless you start making 3D capacitors

1415
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,040
which is very hard to make right the

1416
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,960
second issue is every time you are

1417
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:00,800
trying to read you are also switching

1418
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,319
the material. So there is read disturb

1419
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,000
or you're writing the material as you're

1420
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,960
reading it too. So that means the amount

1421
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,400
of endurance that is available to you is

1422
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,839
limited. But certainly you can yeah

1423
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,359
nothing is stopping you from using it as

1424
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:15,240
a capacitor memory.

1425
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:17,599
Great. So there's a question

1426
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,440
online. Can you comment on whether

1427
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,440
there's an understanding why the

1428
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,920
material maintains its fair electricity

1429
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,680
at extremely thin thickness and also at

1430
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:30,240
high temperatures? Okay.

1431
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:33,040
Um so I don't have like a quantitative

1432
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,440
answer to this like the qualitative

1433
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,000
answer to I have is that the woodside

1434
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,319
structure is the thermodynamically more

1435
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,680
stable state that this material goes

1436
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:46,800
into and I think the if you look at the

1437
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:49,040
energetics of the uh of the the various

1438
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,400
phases it seems like the barrier to

1439
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,040
cross over to the other phase which is

1440
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,559
the rock salt phase is pretty large

1441
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,079
right so this is the only stable

1442
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:57,520
structure it can go into And there is no

1443
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:59,680
other structure it goes into even at

1444
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,680
very small thicknesses or at very high

1445
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,000
temperatures. And so that's I think the

1446
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,599
main reason why uh it stays

1447
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,359
ferroelectric because the polar state

1448
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,280
the woodside polar state is the only

1449
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:14,640
state it knows. Now um we don't know

1450
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:18,480
what happens at the u phase diagram

1451
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:20,480
boundary uh at around 40% scandium or so

1452
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,800
you start getting some evidence of rock

1453
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,800
salt phase coming in. And so if you are

1454
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,520
making an aluminum scandium nitride film

1455
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,359
at say 40 or

1456
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,359
42%. Whether or not it'll stay stable in

1457
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:32,720
the woodside structure phase at elevated

1458
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:35,119
temperatures or a very small thickness

1459
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,640
is unclear. We are we are trying to do

1460
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:38,559
some experiments over them. We're not

1461
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,000
100% sure. But this is a good

1462
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,480
theoretical question to figure out

1463
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,079
right. I'm pretty sure the computational

1464
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,559
material scientists can tell you what is

1465
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,200
the energy barrier between the rock salt

1466
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,960
state and the woodside structure at at

1467
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,040
elevated temperature under a certain

1468
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,880
amount of strain for very thin films

1469
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,200
which is what thin film very thin films

1470
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,599
experience in this material. Great.

1471
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:02,079
Thank you.

1472
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,079
Oh hi. Thanks for the nice talk. So you

1473
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:07,760
mentioned that the aluminum scandium

1474
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:10,079
nitrite can be grown like coaraxially

1475
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,480
um like silicon carbide. So I'm just

1476
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,880
curious have uh how did your engineering

1477
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,520
that or have you done any studying to

1478
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,800
how this like coat will influence your

1479
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:22,480
EC or uh other okay yeah so the thing

1480
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,000
I'll mention we we didn't do any special

1481
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,599
engineering we just took a silicon

1482
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,119
carbide wafer out of the box put it in

1483
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:32,319
the reactor film came out right um the

1484
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:36,160
the course of field on the so silicon

1485
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:37,839
carbide was uh endoped so put so of

1486
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,000
field on the negative side did not

1487
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:42,000
change at all on the positive side the

1488
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,599
course of voltage increase because of

1489
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,599
the depletion region formed in silicon

1490
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,280
carbide. So you have to be careful how

1491
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,040
how doped is your semiconductor sample

1492
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,119
because the depletion layer adds other

1493
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,800
extra voltage across or extra region

1494
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,800
across this voltage drop happens before

1495
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,160
switching happens but otherwise it's

1496
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,960
comparable to what you do on metal

1497
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:03,000
electrodes like platinum was one

1498
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,000
question here I guess yeah

1499
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:17,119
Sorry. Uh can you repeat that? Uh would

1500
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:19,359
you foresee that uh for electric uh

1501
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,200
transistors and like for example RAM

1502
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:23,920
would be integrated directly or would

1503
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:27,280
you rather use silicon for one or the

1504
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,280
other? Well, so silicon I think will

1505
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,640
remain as the base layer of compute. I

1506
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:33,119
don't think it's going anywhere. Right.

1507
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,760
So the com logic layer will remain

1508
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:39,280
silicon camos. The question at what goes

1509
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:41,359
on top of it and this is where I think

1510
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,280
ferroelectrics have a very strong chance

1511
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:46,000
which ferroelectric again somewhat

1512
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,599
debatable if you ask me for high

1513
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,960
temperature extreme environment we have

1514
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,680
a clear choice right now which is

1515
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,800
aluminum scandium nitrite for leading

1516
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:57,359
edge nodes like 45 nanometers and below

1517
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:00,640
Hafne is doing pretty well but again I

1518
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:03,200
I'm yet to see a commercial product or

1519
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:05,920
wide wide market product that has used

1520
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,000
halfneia for its ferro electricity not

1521
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,839
for other properties like enhanced

1522
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,839
dialectric properties or something like

1523
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:14,000
that. uh so it remains to be seen you

1524
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:15,680
know maybe may you know afia makes its

1525
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
way to the market and eventually over

1526
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,599
several years can also improve in terms

1527
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,040
of switching voltages that eventually

1528
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:26,280
there's a transition over to nitride fry

1529
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,280
thank you

1530
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,520
any other questions

1531
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:35,520
thanks for the talk uh there have been a

1532
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,400
lot of recent reports on back end of

1533
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:40,960
line compatible fetss and fifetss made

1534
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,040
from various amorphous oxide channels.

1535
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:45,599
So, I was wondering if you could compare

1536
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,119
uh 2D and oxide channels for back end of

1537
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,480
line transistors. Yeah, it's a great

1538
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,520
question. You know, I I don't have a

1539
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,760
clear answer to what will win out over

1540
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,160
there, right? I mean, 2DS are still

1541
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,599
pretty naent. Oxide semiconductors have

1542
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,119
been around for a long time. They are

1543
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,880
already quite commercial from the

1544
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,960
display application, right? So, there's

1545
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,200
a lot more research gone into oxide

1546
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,119
channels for a longer time. The issue

1547
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,960
with amorphous oxides is that they are

1548
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:13,359
amorphous and therefore subject to

1549
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:15,839
oxygen movement at the interface right

1550
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,839
and so how much does this present a

1551
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:20,160
reliability issue is something that I

1552
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,520
don't know uh 2D charco on the other

1553
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,040
hand should not have this reliability

1554
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,760
issue because again they are vander

1555
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:28,240
walls sort of passed but how good of a

1556
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,400
quality can you maintain of 2D materials

1557
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,640
and uniformity and reliability at the

1558
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,839
same temperatures of growth as oxides I

1559
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,520
think those are the key questions to

1560
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:38,079
answer if The answer to both of those

1561
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,800
questions is affirmative for the 2D and

1562
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:43,760
oxides are like meh then 2D would likely

1563
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,920
win out but that's a big if again we

1564
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,599
don't know.

1565
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,319
Excellent. If there are no more

1566
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:54,839
questions here, let's thank the speaker.

1567
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,839
Thanks a lot for a wonderful Thank you.
