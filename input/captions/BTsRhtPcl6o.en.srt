I'm here today to answer your question

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:06,240
how do you make a unicorn so let's talk

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,280
about making a horse with a horn in the

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,840
middle of its head you may have heard

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,960
about the human genome this is basically

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,960
the set of instructions for making you

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,359
you humans aren't the only ones to have

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,039
genomes all living organisms have

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,439
genomes when we understand these genomes

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,400
we can edit the genome and then change

11
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,599
the characteristics of the organism so

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,160
maybe we could take a look at the

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,000
rhinoceros genome because rhinos have a

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,000
horn in the middle of their head one

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,879
once we figure out what part of the

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,280
rhinog gome codes for one horn in the

17
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:41,360
middle of the head and develops properly

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,640
at the right time we can take those

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,160
pieces from The rhinog genome insert

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,399
them into the horse genome implant that

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,039
cell into a mother horse and Let It

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,359
multiply divide and eventually become a

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,239
baby unicorn magic not included for more

24
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,920
