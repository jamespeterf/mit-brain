1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,000
That is a tough act to follow. Uh really

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,040
thank you so much for sharing your

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,559
story. That was really amazing. Uh so

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,160
there's a lot of opportunity to do some

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,960
great science. Uh and we're going to

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,480
hear uh three wonderful talks uh in this

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,640
first session on next generation

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,359
screening technologies at scale. Our

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,240
first speaker is Gabe Griffin. Uh Gabe

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,640
is a physician scientist at Dana Farber

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,480
and a member of the Broad Epigenomics uh

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,960
program and he's going to talk to us

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,560
about his work on cancer amunotherapy

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,440
and understanding how to make it work

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,440
better. Gabe, take it away.

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,600
Uh there's a lot of really important

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,399
work that we can do in the rare disease

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,760
the rare disease area. Uh the particular

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,600
topic that I'm going to speak to you

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,760
about today is is a collaborative

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,039
project uh we're doing that is

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,680
attempting to harness functional

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,559
genomics and machine learning for rare

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,120
cancer research and particularly to find

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,559
new drug drug targets for rare

26
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,960
cancers. And I'll just say at the outset

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,799
this project is a collaboration uh with

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,159
the ball lab here at the broad

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,040
institute. Uh that lab is run by Dr.

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,520
mybball shown at the top here and a lot

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,560
of the work that I'll I'll speak about

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,680
was also led by Dr. Lauren Wickstrom who

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,680
I believe is is here as

34
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,280
well. Okay. So the talk is organized

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,960
into three

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,040
categories. Our goal is really to find

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,439
new drug targets for rare cancers as I

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,200
said. So the first part will be why rare

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,840
cancers? Why should we care about rare

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,920
cancers? The second part is what are the

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,159
challenges of drug discovery in this

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,159
area and then the third is what is at

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,920
least our proposed solution to these

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,280
challenges. What is the strategy we're

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,040
taking? Okay. So for the first point,

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,280
why rare cancers? So, if if you'll bear

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,640
with me for a moment, I' I'd like a show

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,079
of hands from the audience of anyone who

49
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,960
has been either personally impacted by

50
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,640
cancer or had someone in their immediate

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,719
sort of world impacted by cancer,

52
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,280
whether it's a a family member or a

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,800
friend or a

54
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,080
co-orker. Okay, so it's a a fair number

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,080
of people. You can keep your hands up if

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,000
you don't mind. And so, I'm going to cut

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,720
cut this group in half. So, anyone who

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,480
was born on an odd numbered day, you can

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,080
lower your hand. So if if you were born

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,400
on an even number day, you can keep it

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,720
up. Okay, great. And I'm going to cut

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,040
that group in half one more time. So

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,959
anyone who was born from January through

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,959
June, you can lower your hand. And if

65
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,519
you were born July through December, you

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,879
can keep your hand up. Okay. So I

67
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,480
there's maybe 10 15 hands still raised

68
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,959
in the audience. So what what am I

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,400
getting at with this? The point is that

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,200
uh among all cancers okay while an any

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,599
any individual rare cancer might be rare

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,400
among all cancers rare rare cancers come

73
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,640
come together to comprise about 25%.

74
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,800
Right? So about 25% of everyone who

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,519
raised their hand initially has been in

76
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,959
some way affected by a rare cancer.

77
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,640
Okay. So they they impact they impact

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,480
all of us.

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,000
The formal definition of a rare cancer

80
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,360
maybe isn't that important, but it

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,120
generally uh means cancers that affect

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:22,800
uh about 40,000 or less new people per

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,800
year or 15 per 100,000 cases uh per

84
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,760
year. What is the challenge of studying

85
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,239
rare cancers? Well, fewer patients means

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,480
it's harder to test possible therapies.

87
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,080
Uh it's harder to get samples for re

88
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,239
research. It's harder to get funding.

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,760
sometimes it's harder to make

90
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,400
progress and this problem is

91
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,720
particularly acute in the field of rare

92
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,799
uh pediatric cancers. So in effect every

93
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,440
pediatric cancer based on its incidence

94
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,120
is considered a rare cancer. And so you

95
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,640
can see the numbers in terms of cancer

96
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,400
diagnoses and cancer deaths uh uh on an

97
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,840
annual basis in in uh individuals uh

98
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,439
less than the age of 19 here.

99
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,879
But these are all kind of statistics and

100
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,640
I think especially following the last

101
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,720
talk I think maybe one of the most

102
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,319
critical things to remember especially

103
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,360
from sort of a physician scientist

104
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,280
perspective or perhaps from a patient

105
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,479
perspective is that cancer always

106
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,199
affects an individual person uh with a

107
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,880
family and they don't choose to have a

108
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,240
rare cancer they just have their cancer

109
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,320
and so I think it's important that we

110
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,160
take these cancers seriously for study

111
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,960
and therapeut therapeutic development

112
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,240
like we would uh anything else so I

113
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,759
think that that kind of relationship of

114
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,440
uh you know an individual patient is

115
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,840
highlighted in this statue here. This is

116
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,560
actually a statue of Dr. Sydney Farber

117
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,479
who helped start the Dana Farber Cancer

118
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,040
Institute and uh one of one of his early

119
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,720
patients who was nicknamed Jimmy. He was

120
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,400
a boy who was diagnosed with a rare form

121
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,560
of blood cancer. This statue actually

122
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,919
sits right outside the the laboratory

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,080
building, the Jimmy Fund building where

124
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,600
our lab is. And so, you know, walk past

125
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,080
this statue essentially every day on the

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,919
walk walk-in from the parking garage.

127
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,160
And, uh, so, you know, really serves as

128
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,280
a a source of

129
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,600
inspiration. One of the key discoveries

130
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,320
that Dr. Farber made, this is, you know,

131
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,280
back in the in the 40s, was that, uh,

132
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,199
cancer cells depend on this nutrient

133
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,680
folic acid for their group, for their

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,000
growth. And if you could use a drug that

135
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,240
targeted that pathway, antifolate drugs,

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,320
at the time it was called aminoptrine,

137
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,400
you could actually kill their cancer

138
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,759
cells, in this case blood cancer. And

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,520
ammonoptrine is really the the

140
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,639
predecessor of this drug that's widely

141
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,759
used now called

142
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,840
methtoresate. And in this remarkable

143
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,120
story, Jimmy was treated with this drug

144
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,960
uh when he was a kid. He was cured uh

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,120
and he, you know, lived to the ripe old

146
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,199
age of of being a grandfather. And

147
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,680
there's this beautiful photo from 1998

148
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,520
of him with his his grandkids. His real

149
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,919
name is In A Gustoson. He was originally

150
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,520
from Maine. So I think really

151
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,160
transformative

152
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,560
uh potential for individual people for

153
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,360
for cancer research and and particularly

154
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,320
in rare

155
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,759
cancers. Okay. So what are the

156
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,759
challenges of drug discovery in this

157
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,639
area? How can we make progress uh

158
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,720
similar similar to what I just showed?

159
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,280
So I think at in kind of the early days

160
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,199
of cancer research and and drug

161
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,240
development, there was this sentiment or

162
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,400
perhaps a hope that cancer would be a

163
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,639
single disease and that we would find a

164
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,720
single magic bullet that would work for

165
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,360
if not all patients, most patients. So

166
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,520
that was really a dominant aspiration or

167
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,720
hope in the field. But as as we've

168
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,440
realized in decades since uh cancer is

169
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,919
in fact many many different diseases.

170
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,759
This is one of the challenges of

171
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,360
developing cancer therapies. You might

172
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,120
find something that works very very well

173
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,039
for a particular disease but it won't

174
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,280
work at all for something else. So

175
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,560
really what we need is many many

176
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
different magic bullets. Some people

177
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,919
have even described like a magic shotgun

178
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,840
approach where you you really hit uh you

179
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,080
know an indiv an individual patients

180
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,560
cancer with with at least one or several

181
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,560
targeted

182
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,560
therapies to highlight this development.

183
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,280
So in Jimmy's time there were two major

184
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,560
types of acute leukemia or this acute

185
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,680
form of blood cancer. uh they were

186
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,800
broadly categorized into acute leukemias

187
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,880
that had differentiation like myoid

188
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,080
cells or differentiation like lymphoid

189
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,120
cells. There were basically these two

190
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,319
big categories and uh you know this is a

191
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,520
field that's near and dear to my heart

192
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,000
in my clinical life. I I uh study or I

193
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,160
help diagnose patients with blood cancer

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and this field has evolved tremendously.

195
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,759
This is, you know, not meant to see the

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,199
details here, but this is just meant to

197
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,199
highlight all the many different

198
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,400
categories of acute leukemia that exist

199
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,639
today. There's B acute leukemia, T- cell

200
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,120
acute leukemia, myoid leukemia, and

201
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,039
they're all defined largely by very

202
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,360
distinct genetic drivers, many of which

203
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,520
are are anogenic gene fusions, and we'll

204
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,560
talk more about that. So, there's just

205
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,319
incredible diversity of drivers within

206
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,319
within even just this one disease.

207
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,879
Luckily there has been uh you know

208
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,800
despite this diversity uh enormous

209
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,680
success in the development of targeted

210
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,160
therapies uh for many of these diseases

211
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,080
over the years highlighting just a

212
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,199
couple here. One example is chronic

213
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,720
myoid leukemia or or CML. It's driven by

214
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,479
this encogenic driver BCR able. There

215
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,479
was a tyrrosine kinase inhibitor a

216
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,199
matnib or glevec that was developed for

217
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,320
this FDA approved in 2001 and this is

218
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,760
basically transformed therapy for these

219
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,599
patients. Uh a couple other examples

220
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,320
here uh targeting other uh particular

221
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,680
you know fusions in blood cancer that

222
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,360
have been developed. Now one thing

223
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,519
you'll you'll notice about these is that

224
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,760
these are all the mechanism of action of

225
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,519
these drugs are all ty tyrroscen kinace

226
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,760
inhibitors. What that means is that

227
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,560
these drugs are targeting an active

228
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,320
site, an enzyatic site, a kind of

229
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,959
conventional druggable site on these

230
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,920
encogenic fusions. That's one of the

231
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,360
reasons these have been these have been

232
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,279
possible. So why not just use this

233
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
strategy for all other encogenic fusions

234
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,760
and we can we can cure all rare rare

235
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,279
cancers. Well, the problem with that is

236
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,680
that many key drivers of rare cancers

237
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,560
and many encogenic drivers or encogenic

238
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,600
key infusions actually lack conventional

239
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,519
druggable sites. They lack enzyatic

240
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,519
domains and so they're kind of less

241
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,440
straightforward from a drug development

242
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,720
standpoint. You don't necessarily know

243
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,160
where to design your drug

244
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,440
against. Here's one example of that.

245
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,720
This is an example of an MLL or KMT2A

246
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,360
gene fusion that drives certain subtypes

247
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,360
of acute leukemia. On the top is what

248
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,360
the wild type protein looks like. So

249
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,519
this is a lysene methyl transferase in

250
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,760
its sort of wild type physiologic form.

251
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,519
And the enzyatic domain, the histone

252
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,200
methyl transferase domain is shown all

253
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,440
the way out here at the C terminus, the

254
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,800
set domain. In the fusion protein, the N

255
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,920
terminus of wild type MLL is retained

256
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,080
and then there's a break and one of

257
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,720
various gene partners can come on the C

258
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,360
terminus and this essentially causes the

259
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,600
loss of this enzyatic domain. So this

260
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,240
kind of conventional approach enzyatic

261
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,720
targeting disrupting an active site

262
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,720
won't work for an MLL fusion

263
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,720
protein. Okay. So what what can we do?

264
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,680
How can we go after this? Well, MLL is

265
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,600
actually a beautiful example uh in large

266
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,240
part due to a lot due to work that has

267
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,240
has been done um locally. There's been

268
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,760
enormous therapeutic progress in this

269
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,760
area and a key insight was the discovery

270
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,360
that MLL fusion proteins actually form

271
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,560
encoenic protein complexes and that's

272
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,560
illustrated here. So the you can almost

273
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,399
imagine the fusion protein acting as a

274
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,640
scaffold for recruiting all these other

275
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,440
transcriptional regulators including

276
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,880
this protein menin and that encoenic

277
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,279
transcription complex finds target genes

278
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,880
that are critical for promoting the

279
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,519
leukemia. So if somehow you could

280
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,920
disrupt this complex you would prevent

281
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,720
activation of these leukem leukemagenic

282
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,279
genes and uh potentially cure patients

283
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,200
leukemia.

284
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,440
So that has been an enormous success

285
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,079
story. So there's an inhibitor actually

286
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,120
several different inhibitors of of this

287
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,760
protein menin which these drugs in

288
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,360
general uh disrupt protein protein

289
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,360
interaction between menin and this

290
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,160
ankcoenic fusion uh the MLL fusion and

291
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,399
disrupts uh its ability to activate

292
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,360
leukemagenic genes and is very effective

293
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,120
in MLL rearranged leukemia. So I think

294
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,920
there's a nice paradigm here for

295
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,040
thinking about how to drug encogenic

296
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,160
fusion complexes in a way that doesn't

297
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,600
require you know kind of a conventional

298
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,720
enzyatic inhibition approach and of note

299
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,880
this uh MLL inhibitor revanib received

300
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,440
FDA approval recently in

301
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:10,800
2024. Okay. So how can we build on this

302
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,760
kind of paradigm of of menin inhibitors

303
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,880
for MLL rearranged leukemias and extend

304
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,839
it to other leukemias and other

305
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:21,120
encogenic fusion driven rare

306
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,160
cancers. That was really the or origin

307
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,760
of our of our work and collaboration.

308
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,360
This is just a summary. I won't go

309
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,279
through all the text but basically the

310
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,120
targets that we're that we're interested

311
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,920
in are ankcogenic fusion proteins in

312
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,839
rare cancers. Our hypothesis is that the

313
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,800
ankcogenic fusion proteins form these

314
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,480
complexes that are critical to cancer

315
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,240
growth. A additional hypothesis is that

316
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,800
if you can disrupt those those

317
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,079
complexes, these will be targetable

318
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,240
effective dependencies for rare cancers.

319
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,760
And the objectives of our work is really

320
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,440
to define the functional interactors of

321
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,000
ocogenic fusion proteins in rare

322
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,639
cancers, but to do this in a way that is

323
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,959
really scalable and costefficient. So

324
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,560
perhaps to accelerate this this process

325
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,160
beyond kind of conventional

326
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,560
approaches and to do that our strategy

327
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,639
is to integrate some of the high

328
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,000
throughput uh technologies scalable

329
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,440
technologies that have been developed

330
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,680
over the last you know decade and

331
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,000
beyond. uh first in functional genomics

332
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,480
that's what my lab really specializes in

333
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,680
doing crisper screens to you know

334
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,079
identify new new therapeutic targets and

335
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,839
then also uh structural modeling of

336
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,240
ankcogenic fusion proteins using some of

337
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,839
these just revolutionary computational

338
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,959
structural biology tools that have come

339
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,399
out uh in including things like

340
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:40,399
alphafold putting these two together we

341
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,360
want to uh prioritize new drug targets

342
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,800
for ankafusion positive rare

343
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,320
cancers okay so in the subsequent slides

344
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,680
just have a few more slides ides uh to

345
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,360
show our progress so this far in this

346
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,200
project. We're going to I'm going to be

347
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,880
using the MLL ankcogenic fusion in

348
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,639
leukemia as kind of a benchmarking

349
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,079
control for our method development and

350
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,680
for illustration

351
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:02,079
purposes. Okay. So this step one of our

352
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,760
method is to identify cell lines from

353
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,760
the cancer dependency map that was

354
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,760
generated here at the broad institute

355
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,160
that have a functional dependency on a

356
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,160
given agogenic gene fusion. So in this

357
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,560
particular case we're looking at all of

358
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,639
the depth map data. All each each dot

359
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,240
here is a cell line. Okay. And then

360
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,240
we're looking on the x-axis of the

361
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,760
effect of knocking out one component of

362
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,079
this gene this gene fusion ml or

363
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,600
KMT2A. And you can see that uh cell

364
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,959
lines to the left. These are cell lines

365
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,639
that die when you knock out that

366
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,480
encogenic gene fusion. These indeed are

367
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,240
in highly enriched for leukemia cells

368
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,920
that harbor this this encogenic chain

369
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,680
fusion. So it's a way essentially of

370
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,199
identifying cell lines that have a

371
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,600
strong functional dependency on this

372
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,680
encogenic chain fusion. So we collect

373
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,480
all

374
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:50,880
those. Next we then identify among those

375
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,720
cell lines selective gene knockout

376
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,040
dependencies that are really unique to

377
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,639
that particular encogenic gene fusion.

378
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,160
In other words, these are genes that if

379
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,480
you knock like other genes that if you

380
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,560
knock them out in that cell line, the

381
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,320
the cancer cells will will die as well.

382
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,680
And so that this is a this is a group of

383
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,440
those that come out of this kind of

384
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,959
analysis.

385
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
And what you can see here is that this

386
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,240
approach in a kind of unbiased way also

387
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,320
finds menin this known interactor of of

388
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,959
MLL alcogenic fusion and a known drug

389
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,399
target uh in this in this context. So

390
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,360
the hypothesis would be that there's

391
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,760
probably other uh members of an MLL

392
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,760
fusion protein uh complex that that are

393
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,760
included in these in these

394
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,760
codependencies.

395
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,839
So the question then becomes well how

396
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,000
you know given this this list of of

397
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,279
codependencies say we took the top 50

398
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,440
from this how can we

399
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,800
then associate them together are they

400
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,959
all just random genes or do they

401
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,959
actually you know come together to form

402
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,720
true true fusion protein

403
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:55,000
complexes. So h essentially how could we

404
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,639
group them into little little

405
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,199
subgroups? So one one strategy is to use

406
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,120
an approach like uh string databases.

407
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,680
These are beautiful databases that have

408
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,279
been kind of built on the top of all of

409
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,839
the literature and published data that's

410
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,759
come out over over the decades. A lot of

411
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,440
it experimentally informed where people

412
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,360
have you know pulled down particular

413
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,120
proteins and done things like mass spec

414
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,199
to find what the the protein interaction

415
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,440
partners are. This is a great starting

416
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,759
point and you can see that even uh you

417
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,800
know in string you can find uh

418
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,279
interaction networks that involve men

419
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,240
mll and some of the known known encoenic

420
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,560
fusion partners. So this is uh you know

421
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,959
one starting point for doing this but

422
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,600
this this method is also somewhat

423
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:43,040
limited by the fact that you know for

424
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,480
this this database is populated by known

425
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,160
information or published information.

426
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,399
And so it would also be nice to to

427
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,079
complement this with a way that sort of

428
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,639
a strategy that can associate proteins

429
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,800
without any reliance on published data

430
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,480
or uh perhaps you know uh you in a

431
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,000
context where maybe a protein hasn't

432
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,079
been studied before. How could you how

433
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,240
could you approach that and this is

434
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,160
where alphafold comes in and this has

435
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:11,360
been the work largely led by uh uh uh

436
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,679
the kickball lab. So you can use uh you

437
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,079
know in short alpha fold can allow you

438
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,799
to predict the structure of a protein

439
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,319
just from its primary protein sequence.

440
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,079
And there are new newer versions of

441
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,480
alphafold that can also allow you to do

442
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,480
protein protein interaction modeling to

443
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,400
potentially identify protein protein

444
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,240
interaction surfaces that could be could

445
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,080
be druggable. So we uh took all of those

446
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,600
codependencies and then without any

447
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,440
prior knowledge about them other than

448
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,080
what what AlphaFold could teach us, we

449
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,559
tried to do pair-wise interactions

450
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,320
between all of

451
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,000
them. And what's shown here is the

452
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,679
result of that. So if you do pair-wise

453
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,760
interactions between all of these

454
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,640
individual codependencies and the MLL

455
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,360
fusion protein, this is what you see uh

456
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,440
kind of gratifyingly men. So this

457
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,160
established target is at the top of this

458
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,480
list. It's the fourth highest sort of

459
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,280
confidence predicted uh interaction with

460
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,880
with the MLL encogenic fusion protein.

461
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,600
And so this really gives us confidence

462
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,000
that this type of strategy if applied to

463
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,720
other uh encogenic fusions could

464
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,840
identify, you know, meaningful um

465
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,679
meaningful

466
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,120
PPIs. And uh just to drill down on this

467
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,440
a little bit further, this is this

468
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,640
beautiful representation where there's

469
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,440
uh the menin protein in tan and there's

470
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,919
this men and interacting peptide of MLL

471
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,679
which is an aqua and then a bunch of the

472
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,120
uh individual uh uh contact points

473
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,000
between these two that were identified

474
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,679
as as of high competence by Alphaold.

475
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,200
And so it can really help you even get

476
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,480
down to the molecular level or

477
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,080
structural biology level to find you

478
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,760
know interaction surfaces that you could

479
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,200
then exploit for for drug

480
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,039
development. Okay. And then the last

481
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,960
step uh once we have these structural

482
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:59,919
computational models with all these PPI

483
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,640
surfaces uh predicted then the question

484
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,880
becomes well how can you validate their

485
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,559
function and this is where we bring back

486
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,520
in or circle back to the function

487
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,520
function genomics approaches integrating

488
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,360
base editor tiling munogenesis of

489
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,120
encogenic fusions where we're basically

490
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,360
introducing point mutations across the

491
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,120
entirety of a fusion and testing the

492
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,080
functional effect of that in high

493
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,320
throughput screens. And once we have

494
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,960
that data, we can then integrate that

495
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,039
with the structural predictions to

496
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,720
nominate candidate drug binding sites.

497
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,160
And so this is an example of doing this

498
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,640
for for the menin uh menin protein where

499
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,240
we uh this is actually re reanalysis of

500
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,039
published tiling data from this

501
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,799
reference uh for the menin protein and

502
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,919
you can see that there are a number of

503
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,520
resistant hits that come out of uh this

504
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,640
screen. These are basically mutations

505
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,840
that prevent men and inhibitor effects

506
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,039
in these cells. And then you can then

507
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,720
plot those uh resistant sites onto these

508
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,760
structural predictions that we've had

509
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,799
that we've generated and find um that

510
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,400
indeed these sites affect known drug

511
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,799
binding sites and kind of make sense

512
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,039
from a structural

513
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:13,200
standpoint. Okay. So the next steps for

514
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,720
this is to develop this general approach

515
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,320
now that it seems to be working in this

516
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
positive control or benchmarking

517
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,080
context. Develop it as a scalable

518
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,200
workflow to identify novel interaction

519
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,440
sites in additional or potentially all

520
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,240
agenic fusion positive cancers that we

521
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,440
have some functional uh dependency data

522
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,080
for and we're specifically focusing our

523
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,159
efforts now on leukemia or blood cancers

524
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,520
and also increasingly now in pediatric

525
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:42,159
saroma. Okay. So with that, I'll stop.

526
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,480
Acknowledgements uh to folks in my lab,

527
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,280

this project. Thank you very much.

535
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,120
Okay, as Jillian mentioned, we're going

536
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,480
to do a Q&A after all three speakers.

537
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,799
So, I'd like to welcome up our next

538
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,720
speaker, JT Neil. JT Neil is an

539
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,960
institute scientist here at the Broad.

540
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,720
He is the director of systems genomics

541
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,559
in the metabolism program and part of

542
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,520
the Novo Nordisk Center. And yes, I just

543
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,520
memorized that right now. JT, take it

544
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,600
away. Perfect. All right. I'm really

545
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,280
excited to be here representing our

546
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,880
team. I'm gonna actually stand out here

547
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,600
because they don't build these podiums

548
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,679
for people of my stature. U so uh the

549
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,280
our our our project is called rapidly

550
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,039
identifying drugs for rare disorders by

551
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,360
pulled imagebased profiling. Uh I'll be

552
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,120
giving the talk today, but uh I actually

553
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,760
am co-leading this project with an

554
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,520
carpenter who's here at the Brook. So I

555
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,039
don't think I need to convince really

556
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,240
anyone in this room that therapeutics

557
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:00,159
are a major unmet need for rare

558
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,240
diseases. And uh as you all are aware

559
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,320
rare diseases collectively are not rare.

560
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,799
Uh as many as 30 million Americans or

561
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,520
nearly 10% of people in the US are

562
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,080
affected by a rare disease and they

563
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,400
cause over a third of deaths in the

564
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,039
first year of life. So this is really a

565
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,000
heartbreaking medical

566
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:20,000
problem. Additionally there are

567
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,840
thousands of these diseases perhaps as

568
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,280
many as

569
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,320
10,000 and there are approved treatments

570
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,799
available for 5% or fewer of these. So

571
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,120
this is really a huge clinical gap that

572
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,400
needs to be

573
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:35,200
filled and part of the reason this gap

574
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,280
exists is because drug development uh

575
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,520
canonical drug development denovo drug

576
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,039
development is both incredibly expensive

577
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:46,240
and incredibly slow. So uh we can take

578
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,720
anywhere from 10 to 17 years to develop

579
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,360
these agents from scratch and it can

580
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,360
cost over a billion dollars. Now, this

581
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,679
makes rare diseases not a particularly

582
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,960
good like commercial candidate because

583
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,480
unless we can figure out a way to

584
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,240
aggregate patient populations, there's

585
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,320
no way for drug companies to recoup this

586
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,760
money. Plus, people are suffering from

587
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,400
these diseases all the time and we just

588
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,880
don't have the

589
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,559
time. So, we and others actually many

590
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,120
others in the rare disease community

591
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,799
have come to rare uh rare disease drug

592
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,760
repurposing as a promising approach to

593
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,760
treat these disorders. So in drug

594
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,600
repurposing, we are identifying new

595
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,880
therapeutic uses for drugs that have

596
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,400
already gone through some level of

597
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,400
testing. Uh it takes advantage of some

598
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,039
of these early pipeline steps that fail

599
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,240
out many earlyphase compounds. So things

600
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:37,039
like solubility, stability, selectivity,

601
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,559
um and potency. But most crucially,

602
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,880
these drugs have already been proven to

603
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,039
be safe in humans. And so this means

604
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,760
that there uh the timeline to get this

605
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:49,440
drug into a patient can often be much

606
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,240
much faster and at a pretty dramatically

607
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,120
lower

608
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,640
cost. Well, if you're interested in

609
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,559
doing drug repurposing, the Broad is

610
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,159
really a wonderful place to be because

611
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,480
we have one of the world's best

612
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,760
collections of drug repurposing

613
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,760
compounds in a resource called the drug

614
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,120
repurposing hub. The drug repurposing

615
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:10,400
hub is a very very large collection of

616
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:14,080
compounds over 7,000 that sort of span a

617
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,000
range of uh clinical phases um and a

618
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,000
large number of targets and mechanisms

619
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,600
of

620
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,960
action. Um and importantly it has over

621
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,799
2400 FDA approved drugs. Um so a really

622
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,720
really great resource first inclass for

623
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,640
someone who wants to run screens trying

624
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,640
to identify uh drugs to repurpose for

625
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,159
rare disease.

626
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,000
But we're still facing a pretty big

627
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,039
challenge and that is that these rare

628
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,960
diseases are incredibly diverse. So

629
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,279
there's something like 5,000 rare

630
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,679
mandelian diseases where we know a

631
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,480
genetic cause. We have a genetic anchor

632
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,799
and thousands more where we don't. And

633
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,240
these diseases affect dozens of unique

634
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,880
cell types and organ systems. And so, as

635
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,159
Anna alluded to this morning, many of us

636
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,600
in the community are trying to find

637
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,600
these nodes or these um handles by which

638
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,240
we can we can reduce the complexity of

639
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,679
this problem. Um so, can we identify

640
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,000
some sort of common mechanisms that

641
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,679
allow us to have an entry point? And it

642
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
turns out actually that protein

643
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,120
misloization is is a is a mechanism

644
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,200
that's common to many rare diseases. So

645
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,000
I'm showing you here a figure from an

646
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,240
elegant study uh from Anne Carpenter in

647
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,480
uh here at the Broaden and Miko Typola

648
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,480
the University of Toronto uh in which

649
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,120
they screened a very large number of

650
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,400
rare coding

651
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,919
variants uh and so they overexpressed

652
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,440
these as proteins and what they observed

653
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,279
is that these and they're tagged with

654
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,120
flag tags so you can see where they go.

655
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,760
Uh and what they observed is that many

656
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,960
of these uh proteins are misloized so

657
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,559
they end up in the wrong part of the

658
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,679
cell. So for instance, you know, if it's

659
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,840
supposed to be in the gold, it ends up

660
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,799
in the ER or vice versa. This happens

661
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,679
often along sort of known uh secrettory

662
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,679
route within the cell. Um, and that

663
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,159
these things also tend to fall in sort

664
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,760
of patterns of misloization shared

665
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,200
between uh, you know, some of these

666
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,520
protein variants. And it's not all that

667
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,840
uncommon. 16% of all the variants they

668
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,600
test have one of these misloization

669
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,679
defects. And intriguingly, the degree of

670
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,760
misloization is often associated with

671
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,520
the disease severity. So the amount of

672
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,360
protein that's in the wrong place can

673
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,919
lead to more severe symptoms and earlier

674
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,640
onset of disease. So this leads to a

675
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,240
really tantalizing question. What would

676
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,880
happen if we could move some of this

677
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,080
protein back where it's supposed to be?

678
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,840
Well, it turns out that we actually

679
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,600
don't have to stretch our imagination

680
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,520
all that far because correcting protein

681
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,720
localization is a proven therapeutic

682
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,279
strategy. So probably the best example

683
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,840
of this is in cystic fibrosis. So the

684
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,159
CFTR protein uh chloride ion channel

685
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,960
that's supposed to be at the membrane.

686
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,600
Uh in cystic fibrosis inducing mutations

687
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,679
like CFTR delta508. You see here we have

688
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,760
diffuse

689
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,360
staining. Uh but the it turns out that

690
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,440
if you treat with Vertex's drug

691
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,679
lumicapater you can actually drive some

692
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,200
of this protein back into the membrane.

693
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,120
And when you then combine this therapy

694
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,120
with ivacater which enhances activity of

695
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,679
this channel you can actually achieve s

696
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,880
significant therapeutic

697
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:10,320
benefit. Uh and this this has been

698
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,520
observed for other cases. Here I'm

699
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,799
showing you pgeria and lamina a um which

700
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,720
I I think many of you are probably

701
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,360
familiar with uh in treatment with the

702
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,559
agent

703
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,000
lunafarnib. So our goal really is a

704
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,080
pretty simple one and that is can we

705
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,679
identify new drug repurposing candidates

706
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,440
capable of correcting protein

707
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:31,279
misloization in rare disease. Um pretty

708
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,360
straightforward. So step one, identify

709
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,360
the pathogenic phenotype. So here we

710
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,640
have a very clear screenable phenotype.

711
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,799
That is the protein is in the wrong

712
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,520
place. We are combining that with a

713
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,240
little bit more um complex phenotype. So

714
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,240
cell profiling with cell painting. And

715
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,840
then we just want to test drugs, screen

716
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,760
drugs to see if we can reverse reverse

717
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,400
this phenotype. So can we make unhealthy

718
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,320
cells look more like healthy

719
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,000
cells? So this is pretty simple as I

720
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,640
said. Why has this not been done

721
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,080
already? Well, practically speaking, uh

722
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,159
it's actually quite difficult using

723
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,679
traditional screening methods because

724
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,039
there are if for instance you wanted to

725
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,320
screen all 7,000 drugs in the

726
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,960
repurposing library against just our 250

727
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,880
variants, you're talking about 1.75

728
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,200
million individual experiments plus

729
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,200
controls and

730
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,360
replicates a measly 600,000 if you just

731
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,720
want to do your FDA approved drugs. And

732
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,600
we're not afraid of scale here at the

733
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,880
Broad, but this gives us

734
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,520
pause. And this is because we're

735
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,440
screening these phen phenotypes

736
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,039
optically and that means that we have no

737
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,159
way of taking these variants and pooling

738
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,000
them together because then we wouldn't

739
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,520
know which cell had which one.

740
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,360
Thankfully, we're not held back by this

741
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,960
any further because of a technique

742
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,480
developed in Paul Laney's lab called

743
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,480
optical pulled screening a few years

744
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,480
ago. What this enables us to do is to

745
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,640
put unique barcodes onto each of our

746
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,240
disease variants, amplify these

747
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,000
barcodes, and then sequence them

748
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,919
directly on a microscope using aluminina

749
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,720
chemistry. You'll hear more about this

750
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,039
in Matt Brown's talk after mine. Here's

751
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,279
what it looks like. So, we can sequence

752
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,080
uh on a microscope over sequential

753
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,679
cycles. Each one of these dots is a base

754
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,279
and the barcode. And so, through

755
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,120
sequential cycles, we can figure out

756
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,960
what the barcode is, what cell has what

757
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,919
variant. This now enables us to put them

758
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,919
all together into one big experiment.

759
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:15,919
And we've spent uh the last few years,

760
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,760
my lab working with Paul's lab, Ann's

761
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,760
lab, and some collaborators at Calico to

762
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,200
really platformize this. So this is the

763
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,480
essence of our L2C project. Um we want

764
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,880
to take our 250 disease variants along

765
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:33,279
with a 100 uh of their wild type

766
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,799
partners, pull them all together and

767
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,279
apply a compound from the drug

768
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,840
repurposing library. We'll collect

769
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,520
variant localization and cell morphology

770
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,760
and combine that with optical variant

771
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:48,279
barcoding to enable us to assess

772
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:51,760
compound effect and assign a variant to

773
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:54,159
cell. So this is a huge increase in in

774
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,480
throughput. So here for uh screening a

775
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,720
100 drugs if you did it the oldfashioned

776
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,480
way it would take 35,000 experiments. We

777
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,679
can do it in a 100 experiments.

778
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,000
So our aims are were to build and QC a

779
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,000
barcoded library of these 250 disease

780
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,840
variants and their wild type controls,

781
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,399
capture protein localization and paired

782
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,840
cell morphology using cell painting uh

783
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,360
for both the normal and the disease

784
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,440
associated variants and then to screen

785
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,799
100 FDA approved drugs against pulled

786
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,240
variants to identify potential

787
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:26,480
therapies. We're making good progress to

788
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,880
date in the first year of of our our

789
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,559
project. So, we've finished building the

790
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,320
library and we've qced it. We've

791
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,840
optimized all of our uh screening

792
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,600
culture conditions, staining, incencing.

793
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,159
We've carried out a pilot cell coverage

794
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,720
study to let us know how many uh times

795
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:45,840
we need to see a variant in a cell to be

796
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,000
able to identify hits. And actually, as

797
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,919
we're here in this room together, uh

798
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,840
we're carrying out a pilot screen in

799
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,760
which we're screening four drugs from

800
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,520
the repurposing collection against our

801
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,279
100 disease uh collection. and we hope

802
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,200
to read that out next

803
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:02,960
week. So, of course, it's it's worth

804
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,559
spending a minute to ask how we're going

805
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,159
to think about hits that come out of the

806
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,000
screen. We have no illusions that we're

807
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,320
going to take a primary screening drug

808
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,760
and put it into a

809
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,840
patient. So, uh we're screening these

810
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,760
all in singlicate to begin with, one

811
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,840
high dose and one well. These are pulled

812
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,440
experiments. Uh and so we think this

813
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,039
helps alleviate some of the batch

814
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,520
effects you would normally see in a RAID

815
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,039
drug screening. Um, but any hits we

816
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,200
find, we're going to take back and

817
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:31,080
reconfirm in eight replicates across

818
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,760
eight doses to build a dose response

819
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,279
curve. Any hits from this secondary

820
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,120
screen, we'll take into a tertiary

821
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,320
screen that will be in a cell type. So,

822
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,840
we're screening only in a single cell

823
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,480
type. I should have said helicotto

824
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,559
cells. We will then take those compounds

825
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,880
and screen them against that variant uh

826
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,120
that variant pair now in a disease

827
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,559
relevant uh cell line. So, be it neurons

828
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,279
or endthelial cells, whatever is

829
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,399
appropriate for that condition.

830
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,679
And then we're going to take this back

831
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,960
to the rare disease community. We're

832
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,200
going to bring it back to the latter

833
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,200
ladders to cure uh community and we're

834
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,200
going to um disseminate these data

835
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,679
through traditional um venues,

836
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,120
publications and online portals and the

837
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,720
like. Work with gap bridging

838
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,200
organizations like ENCATs and every

839
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,960
cure.

840
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,039
Um and then engage other rare disease

841
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,880
researchers to see if we can motivate

842
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,760
further experiments be they in vitor or

843
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,080
in vivo as well as engaging clinicians

844
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,799
where uh we have promising candidates to

845
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,399
see if we can move into clinical trials

846
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,559
or potentially even consider

847
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,760
compassionate use exemptions uh for

848
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:34,000
cases where there is extreme great

849
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,000
evidence and extreme need. And then we

850
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,679
hope of course that through screening

851
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,080
these multiple mechanisms, we'll be able

852
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,640
to identify shared nodes that might

853
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,240
allow us to aggregate diseases into

854
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,600
shared classes which might make them

855
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:51,080
more um interesting candidates for drug

856
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,760
companies to want to develop drugs

857
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:56,320
for. And and before I wrap up, I I want

858
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,559
I want to take a moment to uh especially

859
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,799
thank Anna and Jillian and the rare

860
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,320
disease uh community and latter secures

861
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:07,440
here at Broad because um this work is

862
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,960
really really hard to get funded and we

863
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,120
have been trying to get this uh this

864
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,600
project funded especially an has been

865
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,080
trying to get this project funded for

866
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:18,399
years and uh the pilot funding that

867
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,240
we're using here through ladder secures

868
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,480
as one of the initial projects is

869
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,960
enabling us to generate not only key

870
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,519
proof of concept data but has given us

871
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,399
momentum and that momentum we have

872
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,679
actually used now Ann and I are are in

873
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,760
the early stages of of forming uh a

874
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,120
industry uh collaboration a consortium

875
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,960
the Vista uh consortium that will begin

876
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,559
the first process of scaling this effort

877
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,559
now from 100 drugs to 500

878
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:48,559
drugs and uh so this is this is not

879
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,159
finalized uh keep your keep your ears

880
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,000
open but we have two pharma partners

881
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,120
already that are very very excited about

882
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,880
what this data set could could mean. And

883
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,399
then of course in the fullness of time,

884
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,399
you know, this genetic discovery is

885
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,799
ongoing and large projects including

886
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,720
ones like uh the one that Ann is

887
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,600
currently leading are going to discover

888
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,359
more and more of these cases. Uh and so

889
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,200
in the fullness of time, of course, we

890
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,280
have the bold vision of being able to

891
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,200
screen all of the broad drug repurposing

892
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,440
library against thousands of rare

893
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,560
diseases uh to find new medicines for

894
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,159
for the patients who need them most.

895
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,040
So with that, I'll thank the people

896
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,480
who've done the work in my lab um in

897
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,119
Miko Topal's lab at the University of

898
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,480
Toronto, especially my partner in crime

899
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,280
and carpenter and the Broad Imaging

900
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,440
Platform uh and and Paul Blay's lab. And

901
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,359
then obviously huge uh thanks to the

902
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,679
latter secure scientific accelerator for

903
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,679
making this possible.

904
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,000
Hey, thank you so much JT. Our final

905
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:50,560
speaker of this session is uh Matt

906
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,040
Brown. Matt received his PhD uh from

907
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,520
Mayo Clinic. Uh he then came to Anna

908
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,280
Greer's group uh to do his post-doal

909
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,599
work where he's also an awardee of the

910
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,000
Broad Ignite Foundation. So Matt, take

911
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,920
it away. Thank you.

912
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,200
Uh yeah, thank you John for the really

913
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,040
nice introduction. In an interest of

914
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,640
time, I'll try to uh get everyone to the

915
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,720
the coffee break as soon as possible.

916
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,520
But I'm really excited to uh share our

917
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,720
work today about uh using multiplex

918
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,560
optical optical cooled screening uh for

919
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,560
uh proteinopathy uh therapeutic

920
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,560
discovery.

921
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,280
Um so for a long time I've been

922
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,200
interested in how um how the kidney

923
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,079
works and specifically how ep uh kidney

924
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,000
epithelial cells uh which line the

925
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,839
nefron or the kidney's functional unit

926
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,079
uh function to transport solutes and

927
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,839
waters across the apical and basil

928
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:44,560
basilateral membranes of the kidney. Um

929
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:47,680
these epithelial cells uh do this uh by

930
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,000
tra by moving uh transporters uh and

931
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,599
other accessory proteins uh to these

932
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,920
membranes and they do this uh through a

933
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,640
pathway called the secrettory pathway.

934
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,359
Um in these cells uh these transporters

935
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,240
need to be uh synthesized in the ER uh

936
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,000
processed in the Golgi um and then moved

937
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,839
to wherever they they need to function

938
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,720
within the cell and then eventually

939
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:11,200
they're degraded uh using lysosal or

940
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:15,119
proteosomal mechanisms.

941
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:18,000
Um however mutations in protein cargos

942
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,920
um such as muk one or urodulin or

943
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,720
disruption of the secrettory pathway

944
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,320
itself um can lead to proteinopathies in

945
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,520
a in a number of rare diseases in the

946
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,280
kidney and in in a number of different

947
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,400
organs. Um and previous work from our

948
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,280
lab um has identified disregulation um

949
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,880
in a kind of a nodal mechanism um uh

950
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,760
called these T-ED cargo receptors. Um

951
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,200
and these team cargo receptors live um

952
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,800
in the space between the ER and the

953
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,280
Golgi and they and they function to move

954
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,839
proteins uh between these two between

955
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,640
these two secretary organels. Um and

956
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,880
disruption of this pathway again uh

957
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,720
leads to kind of uh proteinopathies in a

958
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,240
number of tissues such as the kidney uh

959
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:02,960
the eye um and the brain. So really um

960
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,200
our central question um is what factors

961
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,960
and genes uh control the efficient and

962
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,480
quality production of proteins and can

963
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,000
this teach us something about the

964
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,000
pathogenesis of of proteinopathies.

965
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,040
So in order to do this uh we we kind of

966
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,720
again uh as JT alluded we took a

967
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,599
approach developed by the Blenny lab

968
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,520
called optical poolled screening where

969
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,839
uh we can take a epithelial cell line

970
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,119
that is expressing cast 9. Uh we can

971
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,200
infect it with uh guide RNAs that uh

972
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,720
disrupt or knock out uh the entire

973
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,520
genome. um we can subsequently sequence

974
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,760
these guide RNAs to demultiplex uh which

975
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,680
uh cells got which knockouts and then we

976
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,720
can subsequently integrate this with

977
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,599
with uh iterative imaging to basically

978
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,000
mark or track uh both our secrettory

979
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,079
organels as well as nodal proteins

980
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,680
associated uh with the development of

981
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,240
proteinopathies. So in order to do this

982
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,640
at a at such a large scale uh we made

983
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,400
some key changes uh to the to the

984
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,040
initial protocol developed by the Bliny

985
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,960
Lab uh that kind of allow us to scale

986
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,359
up. So we optimized our optical poolled

987
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,359
screening approach uh for compatibility

988
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,960
with all commercial highcontent

989
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,400
screening automated microscopes that

990
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,280
really can empower the next generation

991
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,599
of optical pulled screening. Uh we also

992
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,040
increase throughput by uh integrating

993
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,760
the protocol with automated plate

994
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,599
loading uh and handling uh systems that

995
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,960
again can empower drug screening and and

996
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,720
kind of uh then um and so on. And

997
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,119
additionally we can compress the screen

998
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,359
by increasing surface area uh that we

999
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,000
screen by up to 30%. And and all these

1000
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,920
things together uh allow us to scale up

1001
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,760
poolled screening for therapeutic

1002
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,760
discovery. So just a kind of a a brief

1003
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,359
kind of pause here. Um this doesn't

1004
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,280
happen in a vacuum. There's a lot of

1005
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,200
people to thank for this work. Uh this

1006
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,599
was this project was co-led by a really

1007
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,599
talented BBS PhD candidate Brianna

1008
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,520
Silverman um and a research associate

1009
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,440
Jennifer Chen as long as collaborations

1010
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,520
with C dot uh the GPP platform here at

1011
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,839
the bro genomics platform and then a lot

1012
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,839
of uh collaboration and advising from

1013
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:13,760
both uh JT's lab and uh Paul Bane's lab.

1014
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:16,480
So just a kind of a kind of a quick

1015
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,280
aside on uh on how we do this INC2

1016
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,480
sequencing and and and uh kind of some

1017
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,359
of the quality of this new

1018
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:27,440
platform. So as GT alluded uh INC2

1019
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,760
sequencing of guide RNAs is a cyclical

1020
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,520
process where we read out uh the bases

1021
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,720
one by one. Uh you can kind of

1022
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,560
appreciate over 15 cycles of institutu

1023
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,680
sequencing. uh we can kind of

1024
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:42,000
demultiplex an individual guide RNA um

1025
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,520
using two channel uh chemistry which is

1026
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,920
a kind of an evolution from the original

1027
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,480
protocol. Um if we compare this uh

1028
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:52,160
compare these INCU readout guide RNAs

1029
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,079
compared to our kind of ground truth our

1030
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,960
next generation sequencing data which is

1031
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,040
on our x-axis

1032
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,640
um and then our institu sequencing

1033
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,440
results on the y- axis you can see a

1034
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,440
high correlation between uh between our

1035
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,520
guide RNA distribution suggesting that

1036
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,560
we're accurately uh reading out our

1037
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,440
guide RNAs. Uh similarly if we look at

1038
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,280
our our overall library skew we see high

1039
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,440
concordance between our next generation

1040
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,240
sequencing results our incitu sequencing

1041
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,119
results and then our guide li guide RNA

1042
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,480
uh li library library

1043
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:26,400
input. Um when we look at overall

1044
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,560
distribution of of number of guides

1045
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,200
we're capturing per gene uh we're

1046
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,800
consistent with other genomewide uh

1047
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,599
other genomewide screens where we're

1048
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,720
seeing around a thousand cells u uh

1049
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:42,000
knocked out per per gene.

1050
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:45,119
So kind of diving into uh to the to the

1051
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,760
meat of the of the story uh how are we

1052
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,320
how are we changing the secrettory

1053
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:55,440
pathway and which which genes and and

1054
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,440
and factors control the processing of

1055
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:01,839
proteins. So uh using this kind of

1056
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,160
iterative and kind of uh massively

1057
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,720
paralleled approach we can actually

1058
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,520
track the entire secrettory pathway um

1059
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,160
across the entire genome. So we can uh

1060
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,119
iteratively stain organels starting from

1061
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,800
the ER all the way to uh the loome as

1062
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,200
well as these nodal pro these nodal

1063
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,560
t-med proteins that are key nodes in the

1064
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:26,079
development of proteinopathies.

1065
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:29,119
So u if we kind of delve into the data

1066
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,839
and we look at specific uh specific

1067
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,079
aectors of the secrettory pathway uh we

1068
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,480
can observe that uh positive controls

1069
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,880
are our top regulated downregulated

1070
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,920
guide RNAs for key organel markers. So

1071
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,560
for example on the on the x-axis here I

1072
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,640
show transgi contrast and you can

1073
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,560
observe that the top down reggulated

1074
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,839
guide RNA is the guide targeting the

1075
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,680
transolgi. uh we can visualize this um

1076
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,760
in individual cells and again you can

1077
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,520
see cells expressing guides targeting

1078
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,079
trans gulging 2 have an absence of of a

1079
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,720
trans golgi signal.

1080
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,319
If we do pathway analysis of the genes

1081
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,720
that of the guide RNAs that are uh

1082
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:12,640
downregulated uh that downregulated

1083
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,880
transgal they enrich for pathways that

1084
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,520
are essential for Golgi function such as

1085
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,000
ER to GGI transport uh retrograde

1086
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,680
transport and GGI organization. So again

1087
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,079
just highlighting the quality of the

1088
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,319
data. Um and because this is cyclical

1089
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,119
often people ask you know do we can we

1090
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:31,839
reproduce this data across different uh

1091
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,079
imaging cycles. So if we look in cycle 3

1092
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,880
for example and we look at uh the the

1093
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,760
COP 2 vesicle marker SE 13 we can see

1094
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,200
that our top down reggulated guide RNAs

1095
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,520
um encode for both SE 13 and SE 31A

1096
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,119
while we see knocking out for example T-

1097
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,280
proteins which live in this space

1098
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,880
actually uh we see compensation of sect

1099
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,880
13 which is kind of a nice positive

1100
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:58,720
control again you can observe this uh at

1101
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,720
the kind of the individual cell level

1102
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,400
and then the lastly Again, we can go all

1103
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,240
the way to our final cycle, our sixth

1104
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,599
cycle of iterative imaging. And again,

1105
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,680
you can kind of observe the same thing.

1106
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,560
We're knocking out Cal Nexin, uh, which

1107
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,839
is our marker for the ER, uh, is the

1108
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,079
topmost downregulated U guide RNA. So,

1109
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:19,040
these are all great, uh, positive

1110
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,280
controls. Again, if you look at

1111
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,880
upregulated guide RNA, again, it it's

1112
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,079
kind of the who's who of things that

1113
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,160
regulate the ER.

1114
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,280
So what else can we learn from this data

1115
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,760
and how can we connect it to uh kind of

1116
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,359
the understanding of

1117
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,200
proteinopathies? So uh we can kind of

1118
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:40,160
start to understand how organels work

1119
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,240
together and how this process again um

1120
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,359
how organels work together and how

1121
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,400
disrupting part uh of the signaling

1122
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:50,400
between organels um can regulate the

1123
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,960
secrettory pathway. So uh kind of a

1124
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,040
classic example is uh the interaction

1125
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,160
between lysosomes and autogazomemes and

1126
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,240
the formation of

1127
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,680
autolymes. So if we if we kind of uh

1128
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:07,040
create a a dot plot of uh things that

1129
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,760
change p62 or autofagosome uh intensity

1130
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,920
and lampum or loome intensity again we

1131
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,319
can observe that knocking out uh the

1132
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,880
gene encoding p62 is our top down

1133
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:19,920
reggulated uh guide RNA for p62 and lamp

1134
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,240
2 for for lamp 2. Um and then we can

1135
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,560
observe again like we can observe shared

1136
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,359
mechanisms of regulation where um

1137
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:30,319
inhibiting uh the VATPH complex or

1138
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:34,079
knocking it down uh can both activate uh

1139
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:36,160
P62 levels um and uh lysosal levels and

1140
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,400
this is kind of concordant with u the

1141
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:42,400
inh the small molecule inhibitor

1142
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,560
bofalomiain. Uh similarly we can observe

1143
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,599
unique regulators that specifically

1144
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,200
target uh one organel uh and should have

1145
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,400
no effect on the other. So uh kind of

1146
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:55,680
our one uh nice example of this um is

1147
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,920
the our regulators of lipid trans lipid

1148
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,440
transfer from um the ER to nent

1149
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:04,000
autogazomes. So by knocking down uh

1150
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,960
members of this pathway we can activate

1151
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,240
uh autophagy while not changing looal

1152
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,560
intensity. So if we zoom out a little

1153
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:16,160
bit um and we look at multiorganel

1154
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,240
disruptors. So, so uh genes that disrupt

1155
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,960
multiple parts of this process, we can

1156
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:24,400
actually uh start to cluster genes into

1157
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,720
known pathways of biological function.

1158
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:30,000
So, for example, we can observe uh

1159
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,760
organels or guides that um disrupt

1160
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,400
multiple organels and that encode for

1161
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,640
again uh the transport of proteins early

1162
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,200
in the secrettory pathway uh between the

1163
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,280
ER and the Golg. Similarly, we can

1164
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,880
observe uh clusters encoding for uh

1165
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,440
genes encoding for transcriptional

1166
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,440
regulators as well as uh ER stress or

1167
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,200
ERAD pathways suggesting that again

1168
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,760
there is these shared nodes of of

1169
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,920
regulation of this pathway um that are

1170
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,560
important in in the in the regulation of

1171
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,000
of protein

1172
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:02,240
transport. So, if we take a really a

1173
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,079
really big uh zoom out and we think of

1174
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:08,079
the 3,000 causitive genes associated

1175
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:10,480
with monogenic rare diseases um and we

1176
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,359
and we kind of analyze which genes

1177
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,359
disrupt this pathway, something is

1178
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:19,200
pretty remarkable we find in the fact

1179
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:22,640
that almost 15% in 15% of of of these

1180
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:25,000
genes uh actually in our kidney cells uh

1181
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:27,920
result in disrupted organeller uh

1182
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,760
morphology suggesting that these genes

1183
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:35,200
really uh loss of function of these

1184
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,960
genes uh truly um can disrupt this uh

1185
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,880
this secrettory pathway and this can be

1186
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:43,920
kind of an a shared uh node for uh for

1187
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,839
therapeutic discovery. So I'm just going

1188
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,319
to share with you one kind of case study

1189
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,240
and how we can use this approach to

1190
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,119
understand nodal mechanisms of

1191
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:56,240
proteinopathy pathobiology. So previous

1192
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:59,200
work from our lab um has shown that uh

1193
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,160
T-ds uh are kind of a a known process by

1194
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,839
which uh misfolded proteins are are are

1195
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,800
entrapped in the early secrettory

1196
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:09,280
pathway. Uh these team proteins exist in

1197
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,599
uh co-regulated homo ilyic and

1198
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,920
heterolygumeric protein complexes.

1199
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:18,560
Um and if we look at the expression of

1200
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,240
of for example team at nine one of the

1201
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,000
of the members of this complex you can

1202
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,960
see that is that its expression is

1203
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,680
codependent uh with other other other

1204
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:31,920
members of this of this family.

1205
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:34,440
Um if we can uh recapitulate that in our

1206
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,200
screen where we can uh when we look at

1207
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,200
T-M protein levels by knocking out T-MA

1208
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,440
9 or team at 10 we can recapitulate what

1209
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,800
we see

1210
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,880
biochemically. Um similarly at the whole

1211
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:49,200
genome level uh we can observe by

1212
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,119
knocking out uh uh team 10 9 2 and 7 we

1213
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,760
can observe a significant decrease in

1214
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,760
team 9

1215
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:59,359
levels. And this in this uh complex

1216
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,160
family are are highly dependent um

1217
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:04,800
across the board. Um they exhibit uh

1218
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,040
both co codependency um and compensation

1219
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,880
for for one another. So again uh this is

1220
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:12,079
a nice kind of model where we can

1221
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,760
identify novel regulators of for uh for

1222
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:17,520
therapeutic discovery that are

1223
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,599
potentially specific to to uh one uh

1224
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:22,640
complex.

1225
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:26,640
So uh for example uh we can we can look

1226
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:29,040
at team one uh levels uh in cycle three.

1227
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:32,000
Uh you can see that uh team one knocking

1228
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,920
out team mode one biochemically uh as

1229
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,240
well as knocking out team nine and team

1230
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,720
10 uh reduced protein levels and we can

1231
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,200
kind of observe that um in our screen

1232
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,880
versus when we knock out team at 7 we

1233
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,480
actually see this huge compensation of

1234
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,960
team one again s further suggesting that

1235
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,000
there's kind of co-regulation of this of

1236
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,839
this protein uh family. So when we when

1237
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,839
we put all of our data together, uh we

1238
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,760
can observe kind of overall complex

1239
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:01,920
regulators uh that we can potentially

1240
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:05,599
target um to to more selectively uh

1241
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,599
target this nodal pathway. Um if we just

1242
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,280
look at just non- selective team complex

1243
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,720
regulators, it's again what we would

1244
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,960
expect in terms of things that alter

1245
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,440
protein transport, eroggi transport and

1246
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,119
and so on. Um and then I'll just leave

1247
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:21,440
on uh this one point

1248
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:25,119
that we can start to now use this data

1249
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:27,680
to identify uh kind of spec more

1250
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,760
specific uh genomic targets uh that can

1251
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,760
be therapeutically relevant. So previous

1252
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,400
work from our lab has shown that uh

1253
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,480
removal of team 9 uh a small molecule

1254
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,960
that removes teammed 9 uh can kind of

1255
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,559
resolve um resolve several

1256
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,880
proteinopathies in the eye and the brain

1257
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,280
and the kidney. Um now we can start to

1258
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,839
use this data to to target uh more

1259
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,640
specifically uh potentially upstream or

1260
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,960
downstream uh in this pathway um at the

1261
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,720
genomewide

1262
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,280
level. So I just want to thank again our

1263
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,680

1268
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:10,200
project. So, thank you.

1269
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,680
Okay, thanks so much. I'd like to ask

1270
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:20,319
our speakers to come up. Uh, so Gabe,

1271
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,760
