1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:12,080
Good morning everyone and welcome to MIT

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,400
data center day one here. I'm Jim Flynn.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,320
I'm a program director here at MIT

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,600
corporate relations

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,800
and I want to say on behalf of MIT that

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,160
we're delighted to have you all here.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,880
First, I want to do a quick

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,679
acknowledgement to our two audiences. We

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,000
have a a pretty good crowd here in

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,960
Cambridge this morning, but we have an

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,920
even larger audience online joining us

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,120
from all over the world, making this a

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,440
truly global event. And I want to thank

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,719
everyone again for joining us. This

15
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,039
event is organized and run by the MIT

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,920
Industrial Lazison Program or ILP. And

17
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,360
if you're with us today, you are

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,879
probably either already an ILP member or

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,039
you're at least ILP curious. So, I hope

20
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,600
you don't mind if I take a a minute or

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,400
two to just discuss the program for

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,799
those of us that may not be as familiar

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,720
with it.

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,159
The ILP

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,799
has been m the front door to MIT for

26
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:23,200
industry for over 75 years. We've been

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,280
connecting companies across the

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:31,280
institute to faculty, labs, centers,

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:35,200
consortia, students and startups. Those

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,360
connections have been finding real world

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,880
solutions to your challenges.

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,240
So why do companies join the ILP? It's

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:50,159
largely because the ILP is the only

34
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,320
program at MIT that cuts across the

35
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,320
entire institute and the startup

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,960
ecosystem surrounding it. Every employee

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,479
of an ILP member company has

38
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,600
complimentary access to this event and

39
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,600
dozens events of events that we run each

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,600
year.

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,680
These events

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,200
are not the only thing that the ILP

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,840
provides.

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,440
At its core, the most important part of

45
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,400
the ILP are the connections that we make

46
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,080
to MIT.

47
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:33,160
Those connections spark collaborations

48
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,160
and the collaborations drive progress.

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,040
MIT data center day stands as an example

50
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,560
of the kind of the kind of unique value

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,840
that the ILP brings to the table.

52
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,720
No other program at MIT is designed to

53
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,000
bring together the diverse expertise

54
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,080
that we have assembled here today.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,879
We originally planned for this to be

56
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,879
just a half a day forum, but we quickly

57
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,239
realized that if you're going to tackle

58
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,159
the key issues around data centers that

59
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,760
you not only have to talk about things

60
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,159
like AIdriven demand, but you also have

61
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,879
to consider things like data center

62
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,120
design, cooling systems, power grids,

63
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,000
orchestration, security, and much more.

64
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,800
And this being MIT, it's not surprising

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,040
that we'll also cover areas like quantum

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,519
computing and other emerging tech

67
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,519
technologies that could make data

68
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,080
centers of the future look very much

69
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,000
different than they are today.

70
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,159
So today you'll hear from computer

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,959
scientists, civil and mechanical

72
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,599
engineers, cyber security experts,

73
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,599
material scientists, and more. We'll

74
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,760
talk about software, hardware, cooling

75
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:53,760
systems, and even sustainable cement.

76
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,080
MIT's motto, men's at Manus, is deeply

77
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,040
ingrained in our culture here. It

78
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,920
signifies that we are not only focused

79
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,840
on advancing knowledge, but also its

80
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,000
application.

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,959
Nowhere is this more evident than in the

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,400
vast and I would say almost unique

83
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,480
startup ecosystem around MIT. That's why

84
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,919
we created a program called the MIT

85
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,959
Startup Exchange. It's so ILP members

86
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,440
could go beyond just learning about

87
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,280
things that could matter in a few years,

88
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,400
but to work today with over 800 MIT

89
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,199
connected startups that are taking MIT

90
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,600
inventions and innovations and creating

91
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,520
real products and services that you can

92
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,639
use now. So this form reflects what

93
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,120
makes MIT unique. Where else would you

94
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,600
find a physicist, an architect, and a

95
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,240
computer scientist all debating the same

96
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,040
building and all of them being right? At

97
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,639
MIT, it's not a joke. It's just a normal

98
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,360
Tuesday.

99
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,720
So to summarize our aims here today, we

100
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,440
want to leave you want you to leave here

101
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,880
with three important things. First,

102
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,520
insights from the researchers and the

103
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,880
entrepreneurs working at the forefront

104
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,000
of compute and infrastructure ideas.

105
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,880
These ideas that spark new approaches to

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,400
challenges that you're facing today such

107
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,160
as

108
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,360
balancing AI demand with energy

109
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,800
resilience and sustainability.

110
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,840
And third, connections. Because we know

111
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,720
that innovation and breakthroughs happen

112
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,919
when industry, academia, and

113
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,320
entrepreneurs all work together across

114
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,000
organizational boundaries and across

115
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,800
disciplines.

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,199
So, buckle up. We'll be covering

117
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,840
everything from atoms to algorithms to

118
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,080
air conditioning. And in true MIT style,

119
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,400
we'll wrap up with pizza and beer

120
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,400
networking and of course a lot more

121
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,400
brainstorming.
