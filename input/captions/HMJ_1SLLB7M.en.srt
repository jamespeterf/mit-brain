1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,839
hi good morning everyone I'm py from M

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,240
systems really glad to have the

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,200
opportunity to meet all of you today so

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,000
um Mobi is also a spinoff from uh MIT

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,119
actually from the computer science and

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,520
AI lab right across the street so to

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,760
today many of the teams still actually

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,119
have the route back from the a lab and

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,800
Mobi we develop a large scale planning

10
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:31,119
and scheduling system that can really

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,000
solve for large scale planning problems

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,120
with uncertainty and more importantly in

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,200
collaboration with humans and then

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,120
secondly it's not just generating a

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,760
static plan but able to quickly adapt to

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,160
any changes disruptions in a highly

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,879
Dynamic environment so you can probably

18
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,160
already guessed actually our first

19
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,879
vertical to start delivering our product

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,160
is in travel and transportation our

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,120
launch customer is Tui from Hanover

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,399
Germany they are the largest tourism

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,359
group in the whole world we are

24
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,119
basically a core among their platform to

25
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:08,280
operate transfer services across their

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,040
uh worldwide business the this kind of

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,960
illustration give you an idea of how the

28
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,439
system works where effectly at the

29
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,920
center becomes uh among all the

30
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:19,000
different parties from The Travelers to

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,960
their operation team to the drivers

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,280
operating the vehicles that coordinates

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,159
the dispatch the decision making the

34
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,360
resource allocation among all of them

35
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,560
hundreds of millions of decisions flow

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,040
through our PL platform every year and

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,079
you can imagine from this diagram each

38
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,200
part is receiving different information

39
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,920
from the system as well as providing

40
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,880
additional constraints input back to us

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,600
to request updates or new plans to be

42
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,200
generated so the operational efficiency

43
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,640
as you may guess is actually not quite

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,439
straightforward it's actually com in

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,640
three folds first we will actually be

46
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,680
able to greatly lower the planning time

47
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,000
from hours down to minutes and then

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,560
sometimes in seconds allowing a way more

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,680
IG operation secondly because we are a

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,680
central platform connecting all of the

51
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,479
different parties and equipment

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,120
operating in the network we're able to

53
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,560
enhance the decision making looking

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,519
across all the constraints not requiring

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,040
humans to connecting different pieces

56
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:21,480
together and finally we are also

57
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,400
achieving greater flexibility supporting

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,280
more than a thousand different type of

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,640
vehicles and even more type of business

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,480
constraints to allow the system to

61
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,360
perform differently for different

62
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,800
countries and different

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,680
destinations the past 12 months is the

64
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,560
first time we achieve a global roll out

65
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,040
and then we were able to support more

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,319
than 25 million passengers throughout

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,200
the 12 months as you can imagine behind

68
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:47,560
the scenes actually hundred of millions

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,360
of decisions being made automatically by

70
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,440
our system and then is even during a

71
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,959
peak day more than 200,000 passengers

72
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,080
are supported by platform for their

73
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:00,760
Journeys through the Tue Network this

74
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,879
platform has also also been proven to be

75
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,640
robust across 4 uh 40 different

76
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,720
countries more than 100 destinations and

77
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,040
then we have successfully achieved more

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,720
than 99% reduction on planning time and

79
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,480
a cost reduction from the very first day

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,200
we turn on our

81
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,239
platform moving to the next stage we

82
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,560
also recognize the complexity of

83
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,360
deploying such large scale complex

84
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,720
planning systems with thousands of

85
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,920
parameters and constraint types so

86
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,680
really in the past two years large

87
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,000
language model development had really

88
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:39,519
give us an edge to actually tackle that

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,599
by allowing an automated system to work

90
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,239
together with the operators of our

91
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,280
system to actually give them a natural

92
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,280
language interface and then behind the

93
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,400
scene automatically map what they're

94
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,159
looking for into structure query

95
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,439
languages describing the constraints the

96
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,920
objective functions such that people

97
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,439
without much training they can still be

98
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,599
working with the system on day one

99
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:06,400
let me give you a very um simple example

100
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,519
like a search Cy I want to look for a r

101
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,799
carton by the ocean that's also warming

102
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,439
generate in a city with nonstop flight

103
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,360
from Boston you can imagine you have to

104
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,359
tap into many different system many

105
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,280
different search routing Transportation

106
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,440
Planning functions and then distributed

107
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,600
data set in order to come up with the

108
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,680
accurate answer but now with our natural

109
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,160
language interface and then really the

110
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,560
already powerful platform everything can

111
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,600
be handled in real time and then in a

112
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,240
fully automated way so the reason we're

113
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,320
here is we believe the planning

114
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,800
scheduling and resource allocation

115
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,720
platform we have developed would have

116
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,000
huge impact Beyond travel and all the

117
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,160
work we have done before may have an

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,840
similar impact in maintenance repair

119
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,960
Disaster Response Transportation or

120
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,600
manufacturing and supply chain however

121
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,160
we have to make decision in

122
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,680
collaboration with human for space for

123
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,320
time and resource location we're looking

124
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,520
forward to share more and learn more

125
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,919
from you during the lunch break after

126
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,919
this session thank you thank you so much
