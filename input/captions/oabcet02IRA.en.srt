00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,120
my name is Ariel first and I am the Palm

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,800
cook Career Development professor of

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,840
chemical engineering I started at MIT in

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,519
2019 and my lab generally focuses on

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,000
energy Equity that's the idea that

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,960
marginalized and disadvantaged

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,359
communities have been disproportionately

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,439
impacted by

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,760
industrialization and they're often left

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,119
out of the conversation and Technologies

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,679
to combat the um the challenges

12
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,200
associated with that and the kind of

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,079
pollu associated with that so the idea

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,040
of energy Equity is that as researchers

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,640
it's our job to develop technologies

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,559
that are accessible and um also we

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,160
strive for energy Justice which is to

18
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,600
remediate those prior harms I get made

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,559
fun of a lot by my students because I

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,079
always say microbes are the coolest

21
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:52,039
microbes can pretty much do everything

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,520
that we've tried to do chemically

23
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:55,719
they're like tiny little chemical

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,719
factories that can produce whatever we

25
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,920
want and they have 4 billion years of

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,920
evolution on anything a student can do

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,640
during their PHD so we try to harness

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,439
what Nature has already evolved to um

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,560
produce greed materials to um

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,600
make probiotics and other

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,360
Biotherapeutics that um can help humans

32
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,479
and also to make processes like

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,240
agriculture more sustainable by using

34
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,920
microbes that would natively be in the

35
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,880
soil instead of chemicals um one of our

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,040
major breakthroughs in that area is that

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,680
surprisingly many microbes when you take

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,560
them out of their comfy cozy home

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,759
wherever they live uh they don't like to

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,840
keep living without their neighbors and

41
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,320
without the nutrients in that

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,360
environment and so they're actually

43
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,880
really hard to formulate to deliver back

44
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,360
to these environments so whether that's

45
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,399
your gut or the soil um or even the

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,439
built environment and things like

47
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:57,520
self-healing cement and so what we try

48
00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:00,759
to do is develop materials that are

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,159
based on bioderived components so things

50
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,759
like green tea extract or components

51
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,920
that are founded wine and coffee and we

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,080
can form little suits of armor on the

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,920
microbes that protect them from these

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,599
stressors and allow them to be delivered

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,760
to where they need to go microbes can be

56
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,959
used for many different Industries uh

57
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,840
right now one of the areas we are very

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:26,239
focused on is microbes and agriculture

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,720
mostly because in Native systems that's

60
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,640
what supplies nutrients to plants and

61
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,800
protects them from p and things like

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,319
that so the fact that we use chemical

63
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,640
fertilizers and pesticides right now is

64
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,599
basically destroying what was natively

65
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,280
there so right now the microbial

66
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,400
agriculture Market is about a $4 billion

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,159
Market which sounds large but the

68
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:53,120
agrochemical market is $250 billion and

69
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,920
we think with our uh kind of Nano suits

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,280
of armor that allow us to make these

71
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,640
microbes and manufacture them at scale

72
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,760
that we can deliver these and replace a

73
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,800
lot lot of those

74
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,159
agrochemicals so when we think about

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,560
agriculture it's actually one of the

76
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,879
major contributor to to greenhouse gases

77
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,560
so CO2 emissions from one of the main

78
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:14,720
processes to make nitrogen fertilizers

79
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,440
uh represents about 2% of global CO2

80
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,560
emissions and agriculture in general is

81
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,319
about 11% of us CO2 emissions so it's a

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,400
pretty significant contributor this is

83
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:30,560
mostly because of the production and

84
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:33,239
transport of those agrochemicals um we

85
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,480
see innovation in the space as people

86
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,400
trying to make those chemical processes

87
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,120
Greener that's a lot of What organic

88
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,519
farming is but what we really want to do

89
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,120
is move from chemicals to what we call

90
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,159
regenerative agriculture which is the

91
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,200
idea that if you deliver live microbes

92
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,920
back to the soil they'll be able to

93
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,239
sustain themselves and keep the soil

94
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,840
healthy for long past just the

95
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,120
application of those microbes so right

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,599
now most of the people working on

97
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,720
regenerative agriculture

98
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,680
um are very wealthy Farmers so the

99
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,360
challenge with not being able to store

100
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,159
and transport microbes is that you can't

101
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,959
transport them to where they need to go

102
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,480
so Brazil is one of the leaders in these

103
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,720
techniques generally regenerative EG so

104
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,239
wealthy Farms there have these giant

105
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,759
fermenters on site where they can

106
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,600
deliver the live microbes the problem

107
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,280
with that is that it's very limited and

108
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,120
who has access to this technology and so

109
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,960
bringing it back to our lab's goal of

110
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,600
energy Equity we wanted to develop a way

111
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,120
that everyone had access to this

112
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,600
technology not just people that can

113
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,680
afford these

114
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,039
fermentors um and this challenge in

115
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,960
formulation has been a problem for about

116
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:45,080
three or four decades with very little

117
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,680
innovation in the space people have

118
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:52,440
added chemicals to stabilize microbes

119
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,080
and other um biologics mostly for human

120
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,080
consumption for Biotherapeutics but none

121
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,400
of them really work so um we found these

122
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Networks that are comprised of basically

123
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,800
minerals that you would take in vitamins

124
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,320
every day plus these components like

125
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,320
green tea extract and they make these

126
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,880
little cages that protect the microbes

127
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,880
from outside stressors
