would like to welcome you to Bangkok I'm

155
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,520
alni of the MIT I gradate course one for

156
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,360
my master degree long time ago and I

157
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,000
cannot remember anything there but I

158
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,720
think many thing I learned and I've got

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,319
experience here and I think this

160
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,720
Symposium very important for Bangkok why

161
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,120
I think I like the what iack Newton say

162
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,240
see further you only on the shoulder of

163
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,240
the Giants so I think you are all Giants

164
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,080
in your your own area I think we would

165
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,919
like to learn from you I think many

166
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,720
things can be used to improve uh

167
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,720
technology and I think another one is by

168
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,639
B Joy right B Joy he said the smartest

169
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,479
people in the world don't all work for

170
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,240
us most of them work for someone else

171
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:48,720
and this true for any company you know

172
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,039
even Google Apple IBM I think you we

173
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,919
need to learn from other smart people

174
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,680
around the world and that's why you are

175
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,159
gathering here for Bangkok I think we

176
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,680
need lots of good solution from

177
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:03,039

178
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,840

179
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,280

180
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,879

187
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,080

stay for like you maybe six seven days

189
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,800
you know but to work and to live here

190
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,919
maybe not very nice so that's how how

191
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,760
can we improve that so that's one

192
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,200
challenge that Bangkok facing I think

193
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,120
maybe the solution from you can help

194
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,560
improve this you know and this is all

195
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,560
problem we see in Bangkok you know PR

196
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,959
way flooding garbage PM 2.5 traffic jam

197
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,560
how can we improve this by your

198
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,440
expertise I think we compare to our

199
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,279
friend you know our our neighbor

200
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,240
Singapore in 1980 when Liu he he was a

201
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,440
prime minister the first thing he

202
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,760
focused about Singapore is productivity

203
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,079
right he he like about corruption

204
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,560
transparency education housing for

205
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:17,560
people he he start with

206
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:20,640
transparency and then in 20 2005 he

207
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,240
shift the focus to exciting and

208
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,880
fascinating City you know but when you

209
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,760
are product you have good productivity

210
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,399
you can create exciting and fast see

211
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:35,399
quite easy right they can have like San

212
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,800
Bay build in I think less than eight

213
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,560
years right for Thailand even to have a

214
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,560
entertainment complex we still debating

215
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,640
you know is it good or bad because we

216
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,720
don't have trust in the government and

217
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,120
that's a big problem so I think we we

218
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,640
can summarize Bangkok at this we are

219
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,920
exciting and fascinating City people

220
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,640
want to visit us you know but we are

221
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,160
City with low

222
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,600
productivity so we have to admit that

223
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,680
and then we have to improve on this you

224
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,160
know so I think technology AI can be

225
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,560
part of the solution to improve our

226
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,480
productivity how can you use less input

227
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,160
to get the same or even more output can

228
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,160
you travel less traffic jam I think Dr

229
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,720
kak came here late because of the

230
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,800
traffic jam right so how can we reduce

231
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,760
that how can we improve that using Ai

232
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,399
and Technology you know I like the book

233
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:28,000
by Ben green I think I I mentioned him

234
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:30,839
because he was a MIT Professor I think

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,720
he wrote the book not Smart City but

236
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,200
smart enough City so as a government

237
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,760
sector you know we cannot invest a lot

238
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,880
on technology we have other things to

239
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,800
take care of like people health care

240
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,680
healthare and other things right so we

241
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,800
cannot invest too much on technology so

242
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,279
I I don't to be the smartest city in the

243
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,920
world I just want to be the smart enough

244
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,880
City with proper investment proper

245
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,880
solution for our people so I think there

246
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,920
are three Circle that you need to to

247
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,920
worry the solution should be people

248
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,639
decide

249
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,279
so you have to be like people Centric

250
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,760
not technology Centric and then okay

251
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,760
business should be viable should be good

252
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,959
investment and good return for your

253
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,120
budget and Technology should be feasible

254
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,240
I'm sure the the the last circle of you

255
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,720
will provide technology feasible

256
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,760
solution but don't forget another two

257
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,800
circles that's so important for the

258
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,000
government sector other why we cannot

259
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,399
invest we have limited budget you know

260
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,160
so we need the Swit spot in the middle

261
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,240
that is a smart in our city so I think

262
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,920
we use we need to use proper technology

263
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,079
to increase our efficiency and

264
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,000
sustainability so that's a key thing

265
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,240
that what are we are looking for AI can

266
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,560
be part of the solution so what have we

267
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,920
been using I think that we should start

268
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,839
with transparency you know because with

269
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,240
corruption and not transparent difficult

270
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,720
to have a productive productivity

271
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,120
increase so we focus first on the

272
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,000
transparency so we start doing like open

273
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,079
data open service contract policy

274
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,519
Innovation everything should be on

275
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,079
website people can come and see what you

276
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,800
are doing so being transparent on our

277
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:09,519
data so if you want to work with BM I

278
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,000
think we have lot of data set that you

279
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,839
can work on and then we can give it to

280
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,680
you openly all the budget fiscal budget

281
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,760
we put it on the website so people

282
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,120
investigate what we use money for you

283
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,120
know and people increase people

284
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,880
interested in the data of the city

285
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,279
before that we have like 400,000 people

286
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,440
visit our website now we have 3 million

287
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,600
to look at our data that we open for the

288
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,399
public you know and this can be and look

289
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,839
at our construction permit you know or

290
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,240
use in the analog you have to submit

291
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,680
seven copies of your blueprint you know

292
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,519
and people go through this by like they

293
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:50,440
use manual to to check it so we will

294
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,519
transform it into digital and we can use

295
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,440
AI to check the building permit in the

296
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,399
future so now we start moving from

297
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,760
analog approval to become a online

298
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,920
construction permit approval from 45

299
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,800
days we can use it 14 days but long ways

300
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,680
to go so something like that we can use

301
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,639
AI to improve our productivity you know

302
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,279
and I think we have another private

303
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,760
sector they call uh they call act AI so

304
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:17,519
they use AI to investigate all the

305
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,360
biding of our project and they can see

306
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,480
the discrepancies in price in something

307
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,680
that not is like fishy thing you know

308
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,839
and they can detect the problem so I

309
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,440
think fraud detection tool you can use

310
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:32,399
AI to go through data comparing and see

311
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,959
the problem so this this uh AI helps a

312
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,480
lot in improving transparency of our

313
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,160
buiding project in Bangkok right

314
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,120
management I think we have one

315
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,240
application very interesting because

316
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,600
traffy Fu the name mean nothing but it's

317
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,240
a simple app that people can use to take

318
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,079
picture of the problem in the city and

319
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,079
then comment yeah maybe comment complain

320
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,079
maybe like oh come and fix this problem

321
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,839
have been there for three years you know

322
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,680
and this the P the picture the GPS you

323
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:04,199
know exactly what location is it and

324
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,480
with a comment the AI can read and know

325
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:08,120
which department it belongs to so the

326
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,279
problem send directly to the people

327
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,120
responsible so don't go to through me

328
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,519
they go directly to my team and they

329
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,360
have to fix it because it's there I know

330
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,800
how long has the problem been there and

331
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,160
how long it has not been solved and with

332
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,279
this data it really improve our

333
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,959
management you know the first day like

334
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,600
20,000 complaints come to this website

335
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:31,680
and they crash over computer but now so

336
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,480
far we have 800,000 complaints and we

337
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,399
fix 100 640,000 of them without me

338
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,279
ordering anything so this are power of

339
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,120
digital and AI also help that right and

340
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,560
then you can know exactly what problem

341
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,920
are there fot Path Road Safety traffic

342
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,800
and then you classify and then you can

343
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,360
do your budget better next year because

344
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,399
you know what's the problem people need

345
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,839
to be

346
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,720
fixed and usually we take the first

347
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,399
month it take like two two months to

348
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,320
solve one problem and after 2 years it

349
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,680
took only two days now to solve one

350
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,399
problem so you can see productivity

351
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,800
improve without any budget more budget

352
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,639
spend because application is free and

353
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,639
the budget for fixing is already there

354
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,199
but

355
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,920
faster we doing some health care right

356
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,720
we do 1 million people heal check up

357
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,120
right now so we have big database of

358
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,759
people in Bangkok and this database can

359
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:27,199
be we can use AI to analyze the problem

360
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,160
and maybe do more preventive care so

361
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,519
this data set is now available you know

362
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,959
to of the health of the Bangkok people

363
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,120
and you can know exactly each district

364
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,880
what problem they have so can identify

365
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,199
the problem and then we can spend our

366
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,360
budget properly on maybe on the

367
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,000
preventive

368
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,600
thing Mobility big problem right I mean

369
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,920
you in Bangkok you know we are notorious

370
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,360
for traffic jam um but I mean in this

371
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,560
location not bad because you have BTS

372
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,279
Like connecting but that's a big problem

373
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,040
so we have about 500 intersection in

374
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,959
Bangkok oh control manually by the

375
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,360
police so police see okay traffic G

376
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,240
pushed red green yellow but now we're

377
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,480
going to use AI to help improve the flow

378
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,199
so installing like 72 intersections so

379
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,040
they like using adaptive control look at

380
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:19,040
the data the traffic and then put the

381
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,399
light on uh properly according to the

382
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,880
demand so this might help improve the

383
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,639
traffic a little bit so you can see like

384
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,680
10 to 30% improve by using technology

385
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,800
for the traffic control and then

386
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,720
in the future we will expand that to all

387
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:38,199
500 intersections we

388
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,959
have and for the safety if you walk in

389
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:43,079
Bangkok you can see many motorcycle

390
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:45,399
riding on pesan way big bad behavior you

391
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:48,519
know but that's what Ty behavior is so

392
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,920
we're using camera to detect AI to

393
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:53,440
detect the the license plate and then we

394
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,839
issue the fine to them so we we hope

395
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,839
that this be help improve the behavior

396
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,720
by using the AI technology educ we try

397
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,839
to cooperate with Google improving the

398
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,600
capacity of the classroom so I think in

399
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,520
the future AI I I don't think it's I

400
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,199
think the problem with viia you still

401
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,799
need people right so not artificial

402
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:18,600
intelligence but intelligent assistant

403
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:21,600
so we try to use AI as our IIA and one

404
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,480
one one reminder I'm not sure is there

405
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:29,039
any Supreme AI you know is there any

406
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,160
Democrat Ai and Republican AI get up is

407
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,200
what the data you feed them right for

408
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,960
example I ask them is a Chaat the good

409
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,480
governor and they can cannot provide me

410
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,000
answer so I think you have to be careful

411
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,200
too because at the end emotion and then

412
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,840
there are database what you train them

413
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,679
to you know so that I'm sure that there

414
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,600
are certain questions that AI cannot

415
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:54,640
answer and me people have to decide so

416
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:58,919
let them be our good tools to improve

417
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,919
the cities thank you very much

418
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,539
[Applause]
