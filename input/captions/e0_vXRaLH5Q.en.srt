1
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,760
I changed my title a bit but I I I I

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,240
mean first of all maybe I should

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,160
apologize to people who heard me uh talk

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,759
I think across the road uh from where

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,039
you are today in December whoops um or

6
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:32,360
November is the beginning will be

7
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,840
slightly

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:39,280
similar then will quickly diverge so

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,039
alil Taste of sort of quantitative work

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,000
we've been doing in immune repertoire

11
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,320
with my long-term collaborator TI mod

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,440
here in Paris and a lot of collaborators

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,399
both locally and experimental and uh

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,600
theoretical people from all over the

15
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,519
world so I'll I'll thank them uh to

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,600
begin with all right with that I'll

17
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:03,559
start with a who done it

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,600
so instead of being sort of in the

19
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:08,159
center of universe as youi right now

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,080
imagine you're in a ro remote location

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,920
everybody's excited this an amazing

22
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,520
Afterparty but the next day Joe is found

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,000
dead and next to Joe's body there are a

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:23,560
few drops of blood that don't belong to

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,600
them so this being scientists they cry

26
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,479
genetic tests for everyone and

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,159
traditionally used tests in DNA test in

28
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:35,920
forens physics reveal that the murderer

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,000
is one of two twins either Alex or Terry

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,880
and so traditionally used test and

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,320
forensics are not able to distinguish

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,960
between identical twins um of course you

33
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,240
being where you are you probably know

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,040
that there are signatures in the DNA

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,520
that are able to distinguish but that's

36
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,600
not what's being used uh but here we're

37
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:03,079
going to call in detective AIA be who is

38
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:06,560
going to use another technique based on

39
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:09,280
immune repertoire so immune

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,200
repertoire basically B cell and T Cell

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,879
repertoire are what we call a diverse

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,760
Ensemble of set of cells whose role is

43
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:21,319
to protect you against foreign pathogens

44
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,239
and so what these what this set of cells

45
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,440
is able to do and what each one of these

46
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:30,080
cells is in principle able to do is to

47
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:32,959
bind proteins uh different proteins that

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,760
presented to it that it encounters and

49
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,720
discriminate for perform a

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,560
discrimination task so basically figure

51
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,080
out whether this cell is natural to your

52
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,480
body your own self what we call a self

53
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:47,760
protein or if it's foreign in which case

54
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:51,239
you should get rid of it um and so if it

55
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,280
recognizes a a protein as foreign then

56
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,640
it'll proliferate it'll make many copies

57
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,239
of itself that will all have the same

58
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,120
receptor as the original cell if it

59
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,680
doesn't recognize anything after after a

60
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,959
while it'll die and the thing to realize

61
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,040
here is that while each cell has many

62
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,360
many receptors they are all of the same

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,879
kind they're all identical receptors so

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
if you want to protect you if you need

65
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,799
to protect yourself against many

66
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,720
different pathogens you need a diverse

67
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,280
set of of different cells and that's

68
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,560
what we call a reper and that's also why

69
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,799
when they proliferate they keep the same

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,280
receptor so this is the story for tea

71
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,000
cells I'll be jumping a little bit I'll

72
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,920
mostly be talking about t- cells but

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,560
I'll be jumping a little bit between B

74
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,080
cells and t- cells I'll tell you when

75
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,480
things are a little bit different and

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,959
when that's

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,640
important um but in both cases we can

78
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,959
now go in take blood from people

79
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,879
sequence it pull out the T cells or B

80
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,120
cells sequence them and since these are

81
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,640
proteins what we're going to get is

82
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,439
we're going to get reads that actually

83
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,200
encode for this protein sequence so in

84
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:07,079
principle what we have here is we have

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,319
access to your own personalized medical

86
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,120
record because the immun because of this

87
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,879
proliferation process the immune system

88
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,160
keeps track of every infection you had

89
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,560
so if we knew how to read what we get

90
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,080
out of these sequences in a functional

91
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,000
sense we knew how to relate this to

92
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,600
antigens or diseases we would know in

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,800
principle

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,720
every disease or at least signatures for

95
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,600
the diseases or conditions that you

96
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,120
carry still in your blood but

97
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,680
unfortunately we don't currently know

98
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,000
how to read it completely and but

99
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,240
basically this is what I'm interested in

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,960
doing I'm interested in figuring out how

101
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,880
to read this information that we carry

102
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,680
around in ourselves so how will this

103
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,120
help us find the murderer well so if we

104
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,680
compare the sample of blood found by

105
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,320
Joe's body to samples from our

106
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,479
suspects we can simply count the number

107
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,080
of shed sequences between the two

108
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,880
samples and based on this we can figure

109
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,199
out whether the two samples come from

110
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,320
the same person or whether they come

111
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:17,199
from two different people this is what

112
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,639
the data looks like so if the samples

113
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,479
come from the same person they are going

114
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:25,440
to share many more sequences in order of

115
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,120
magnitude more sequences than samples

116
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,720
that come from two different people even

117
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,960
if the two different people are

118
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:37,759
identical twins what we see here in pink

119
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:40,240
so basically you share more te- cell

120
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,759
receptors with yourself than with

121
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,680
anybody else in the world even if you

122
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,319
have an identical twin and so thanks to

123
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,520
that we'll be able to identify that the

124
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:54,400
murderer is Alex because who else could

125
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:58,120
it be in this story and additionally if

126
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,199
we found this rub of blood later in time

127
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,960
or we did the analysis later time uh we

128
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,680
could still find a murderer the signal

129
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,560
is stable here we show it Based on data

130
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:13,759
of days post vaccination we're able to

131
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:16,599
the the people look different for on the

132
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,319
order of days but this we use a model

133
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,840
this can extend up to years and and will

134
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:25,639
show you how we find these models that

135
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,960
are able to extend things over years but

136
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,120
at this point you may be asking but how

137
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,479
does this work in detail

138
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,160
so it works so I I'll explain how we can

139
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,479
figure it out but first I need to sort

140
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,520
of tell you a little bit more about how

141
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,319
a t- cell receptor is made so this is

142
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,880
the classical textbook picture a t- cell

143
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,520
receptor has two

144
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,080
arms what I called an alpha and a beta

145
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,120
arm uh let's just concentrate on the

146
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,520
beta they're made out of three segments

147
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,919
which are called VD andj and in your

148
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:02,520
genome you have a certain number of

149
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,919
templates for v d and j okay so maybe

150
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,960
the first thing to realize is before we

151
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,440
go into these details is that you have

152
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,960
of the order of 10 to the 9th unique or

153
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:17,039
different t- cell receptors at least now

154
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,720
you have a theod of 20,000 genes so

155
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,960
since these are proteins if they were

156
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,680
encoded directly in your genome simply

157
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,240
the DNA wouldn't fit into your nucleus

158
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,319
so we need a different procedure and

159
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,080
this procedure combines combinatorics

160
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:34,039
and Randomness to generate this

161
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,240
diversity so in each of your cells you

162
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:39,120
have a certain number of templates but

163
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,120
then the DNA in your cells gets edited

164
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,599
so you pick one V One D and one J in

165
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,919
each cell which gets you to the order of

166
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,680
a thousand different combinations but we

167
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,759
need to get to 10 to the 9th so to do

168
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,840
that there's enzymes that come in and

169
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,560
randomly insert and delete nucleotides

170
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,240
at the Junctions between the V and the D

171
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,240
and the D and the J and with these

172
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,479
insertions and deletions we're going to

173
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,360
get to this 10 to the 9th or otherwise

174
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:11,039
said a billion different

175
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,759
receptors okay so that seems simple but

176
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,319
how do we know that they're going to be

177
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:19,080
different in you and me um

178
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,960
so basically what we're going to do is

179
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,840
we're going to take

180
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,759
sequences that we get out

181
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,639
of as I described out of the sequencing

182
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,279
experiment this is bulk DNA sequencing

183
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,279
but if you get enough sequences to do

184
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:38,880
the analysis you can do it on single

185
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:41,880
cell too uh we we can talk if anybody

186
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,080
has questions about that I'm I'm happy

187
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:50,000
uh to talk about it I actually don't

188
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:52,720
even see the zoom bar at all so if

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,480
anybody I guess you'll tell me if I need

190
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,880
to pay attention I'll let you know

191
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,000
thanks all right so um okay so we get

192
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,440
sequences is out of a sequencer and the

193
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,079
name of the game now what we want to

194
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,160
understand is what is the probability

195
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:14,079
that an individual say yourself that you

196
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,640
generated a given t- cell receptor okay

197
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:17,920
and what is the probability of

198
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,120
generating any given T Cell receptor

199
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,440
that we see in the data and so we're

200
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,079
going to use a trick the so basically we

201
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,680
need to quantify and characterize this

202
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:32,240
process so we're going to use a trick

203
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,720
and the first thing we're going to do is

204
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,160
we're going to look at out of frame

205
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,279
rates so remember you have two

206
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:43,640
chromosomes one from each

207
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:46,000
parent and uh when vdj recombination

208
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,480
happens so this generation of diversity

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,360
first you attempt the first chromosome

210
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,920
if that works great that's the end of

211
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,640
the story but if it doesn't work you

212
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,760
silence it then you move on to the

213
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,360
second one if the second one also

214
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,680
doesn't work well that cell dies but if

215
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,320
it does work then you have a functional

216
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:09,000
receptor so you receptor that can be

217
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,760
expressed on the cell surface and the t-

218
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,920
cell Will Survive but then if you look

219
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,440
in and you look at the DNA in the cell

220
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,760
you sample the DNA you're going to find

221
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,880
the two receptors you're going to find

222
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,399
the one that was a functional one but

223
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,800
also the one that recombined the way

224
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,760
these exper recombined but was not

225
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,800
functional so the way these experiments

226
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,480
are set up is it's specific

227
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,959
sequencing aimed at the immune system

228
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,160
with primers designed for that so you

229
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,800
only sequence DNA that was actually uh

230
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,639
recombined and but if you do sequence

231
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,200
DNA you're going to get these two

232
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,320
chromosomes so what we're going to do is

233
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,800
we're going to use these out of frame

234
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,959
reads and since these reads were really

235
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,240
so basically the reads that come from

236
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,639
this receptor that got recombined but

237
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,279
was not functional and not expressed so

238
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,680
that way we're sure we don't have to

239
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,680
deal with

240
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:09,320
selection and um it's easy to understand

241
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,680
why that's the case for DNA of course

242
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,800
mRNA when I said it's silenced it

243
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,120
shouldn't be expressed in practice the

244
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,279
process is leaky and if we look at mRNA

245
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,760
data we actually do CDs out of frame

246
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,320
receptors too so uh we can also do this

247
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,680
analysis based on

248
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,160
cdna uh sequence okay but we're going to

249
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,120
use the outou of frame reads the

250
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,880
important thing there is that we don't

251
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,600
have to worry about selection and then

252
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,320
the second thing we're going to realize

253
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:41,040
is if we take a given sequence that we

254
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,800
find in the data well what we want to do

255
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,680
is we want to say what's the probability

256
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,320
with which it was generated which means

257
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,839
we want to say well you know we need to

258
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,959
say something How likely it was that it

259
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:56,160
used the given genes that it used as a

260
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:59,240
starting point but it turns out that if

261
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,120
we want to assign which Gene was used to

262
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,959
to the given sequence deterministically

263
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,760
that's impossible because because of

264
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:12,480
this editing of inserting and deleting

265
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:15,399
nucleotides I can assign different V

266
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,279
genes uh to Any Given sequence and

267
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,760
different de gen especially the de genes

268
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,880
which are quite similar and quite short

269
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,160
so we cannot do this deterministically

270
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,480
we're going to do it stast

271
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,279
probabilistically so we have to we we're

272
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,240
going to make a list of all possible

273
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,920
scenarios that are consistent with the

274
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,160
sequence we see by which I mean choice

275
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,440
of V Gene D Gene J Gene number of

276
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,800
insertions at each of the Junctions and

277
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,639
deletions and we do it for all

278
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:48,639
sequences and we assign weights to each

279
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:51,079
of these scenarios and then we calculate

280
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,839
marginals or observables depending where

281
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:55,279
you come from basically we calculate the

282
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,040
probability of using a given V Gene in

283
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,399
all of these sequences having a certain

284
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,440
number of deletions certain number

285
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,079
insertions and so on and then we have a

286
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,199
model which is the most General

287
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,519
factorizable model consistent with the

288
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:10,760
gnome biology which we use to

289
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,720
recalculate these weights and then we

290
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,920
let this convert so this is an

291
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,480
expectation maximization

292
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,320
procedure um that's basically how we

293
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,560
learn the parameters of these models of

294
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,440
of the model which are these elements

295
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,000
and then once we have that we're able to

296
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,639
calculate these weights so the

297
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,320
probability of each of these scenarios

298
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,920
and by summing up over all of these

299
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,079
weights we're able to calculate the

300
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,440
probability of generating a given

301
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,320
sequence so that way we can get the

302
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,519
probability of generating a given

303
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,480
sequence for every sequence we see in

304
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,399
the database okay so I won't tell you

305
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,959
about the details of these models I'll

306
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,079
just tell you about the final outcome

307
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,399
which is what it looks like this is the

308
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:58,160
probability this is a density or a

309
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,240
histogram if you want of the probability

310
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,040
of generation so basically I ask how

311
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,000
many T cell receptors have a probability

312
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,680
to be generated that's 10 Theus 10 we

313
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,160
put a dot here 10 the minus 8 and so on

314
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,959
and so there's two things to note here

315
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,240
one is that it spans 20 orders of

316
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,360
magnitude which means that you have some

317
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,360
sequences which are very easy to

318
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,279
generate given that you're generating at

319
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,720
least 10 to the N different receptors a

320
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:29,480
probability of 10 Theus 5 means

321
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,199
basically you will generate these

322
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,120
receptors and that means you will

323
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,839
generate them and I will generate them

324
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,720
and we'll share them but these ones over

325
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,079
here they're much harder to generate and

326
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,720
we'll still generate some but we'll be

327
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:44,839
there'll be different ones that we

328
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,279
generate and it's thanks to the ones

329
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:51,320
here that we're basically able to find a

330
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:54,160
murderer because what this tells you is

331
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:57,519
that each one of us is basically a

332
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,120
random repertoire generator we

333
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:04,480
have the same same well I'll tell you in

334
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,199
a second why we we have the same

335
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,160
generation process but we generate

336
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,920
different

337
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,639
realizations of uh the the of well of of

338
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,880
the process which in this case are

339
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,040
receptors so why am I saying that we

340
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,759
have the same generation process so the

341
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,759
spread here there red is over 20

342
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:30,120
basically over a thousand different

343
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:33,519
people so real people not genetically

344
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:37,000
Iden called mice or anything like that

345
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,079
and you see and this is basically 95%

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,399
variation so you see that basically this

347
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,120
process of generating receptors this

348
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,600
distribution is very very similar in all

349
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,040
of us so it doesn't matter where you

350
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,279
come from doesn't matter what you eat

351
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,959
basically we have the same probability

352
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:59,720
of generating given receptors

353
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:02,279
so yet because it's a random generative

354
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,319
process we end up with different

355
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:07,120
receptors and again these ones over here

356
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:10,279
that are have a high generation

357
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,120
probability will share and these ones

358
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,120
will be unique so there'll be some

359
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,920
fraction that we share with other people

360
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,040
and some fraction that will be unique to

361
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,240
us and basically this uniqueness is such

362
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,560
that we're able to identify any given

363
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,399
person out of the whole worldwide

364
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,639
population so it's a unique

365
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:33,639
fingerprint um that you carry around

366
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:35,360
now at this point you may ask well how

367
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,920
where does this distribution come from

368
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,639
on evolutionary terms and this is a

369
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,319
question I would love to know the answer

370
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:47,920
to but uh one thing we asked ourselves

371
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:50,399
is well does it depend like if receptors

372
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,839
that are specific and can

373
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,040
recognize uh known viruses are they more

374
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,160
skewed to the right of this distribution

375
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,440
do they have a higher probability of

376
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,880
being generated

377
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,039
and the answer is no so these are

378
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,720
receptors these are these are

379
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:07,640
distributions over receptors that are

380
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,160
known to recognize different viruses

381
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:13,520
that are available in databases such as

382
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,199
PD jdb and we plot the probability of

383
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,439
generation on top of the uh average that

384
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,360
I showed you on the previous line so

385
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,039
there's nothing special about these

386
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,760
sequences that are more likely to be

387
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,600
produced in terms of them being good at

388
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,280
recognizing bugs basically with of

389
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,679
course the caveat that we're talking

390
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,480
here about what's in

391
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,640
databases um going further into is

392
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,600
everyone the same so when we did our

393
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,000
murder mystery at the beginning uh you

394
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,559
know there's clearly a difference in

395
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,679
samples coming from you and your

396
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:53,559
identical twin if you happen to have one

397
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,960
but you the identical twin still you

398
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,679
know was slightly shifted compared to

399
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,400
unrelated individuals so if we look at

400
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,280
it

401
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:07,520
it uh in detail they share a little bit

402
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,919
more sequences than non- Twins and if we

403
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,640
look at the PN distribution so basically

404
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,440
this is the the blue and model red

405
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:20,880
unrelated individuals and the twins have

406
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:24,000
this funny little arm here

407
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,960
um that

408
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,840
uh yeah that basically that this this

409
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,760
longterm a tail that they Shar these

410
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,360
they're more likely to share these R

411
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:41,000
sequences so we looked into this in more

412
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:44,200
detail and so uh the funny thing is that

413
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,039
what's so special about identical twins

414
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,480
so identical and these are identical

415
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:51,840
twins that share a placenta and so

416
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,919
basically identical twins that share a

417
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,039
placenta are the only individuals in the

418
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:00,720
world that share blood in natural

419
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,720
circumstances

420
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,200
not just maybe blood because you share

421
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:08,200
blood with your mother but share share

422
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,400
immune cells in natural circumstances if

423
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,679
we're not talking about blood

424
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,000
transfusions or transplants and things

425
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,840
like that and so they share blood whoops

426
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,600
question in chat what is r in the

427
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,280
previous plot oh it's a correlation

428
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,320
coefficient

429
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,320
um I yeah just just the

430
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:38,960
basically um correlation I think between

431
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:42,320
uh I'm blanking out

432
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,320
um what is

433
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:51,799
a confidence of these points being

434
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:54,880
different from these points I

435
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:57,280
think uh ah no maybe sorry sorry sorry

436
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,280
sorry this is because I didn't go into

437
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,080
this this is the prediction of sharing

438
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,120
in the model and this is the what we

439
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,400
actually see in the data and this is the

440
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,480
co correlation coefficient between what

441
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,360
we see in the data and what the model

442
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,200
predicts because originally this plot

443
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,679
was showing two points that we're able

444
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,400
to predict

445
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:20,120
sharing based how many T cells are

446
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,799
shared or

447
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,320
the between the model and the data and

448
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,799
that's the correlation coefficients

449
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:33,720
between those sorry that was a long time

450
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:37,120
ago so um yeah that's what it is okay so

451
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,799
um good okay so twins share blood but

452
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,159
they share blood before birth they share

453
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:45,280
Blood In Utero and the other thing to

454
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,840
know is that in utero the enzymes that

455
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,360
do that make the insertions the enzyme

456
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,400
called tdt is severely downregulated

457
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,720
that means that the t- cells you produce

458
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:59,600
in utero are actually have many less

459
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:05,000
insertions than t- cells you produce

460
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:07,360
after birth so if we track the number of

461
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,799
te- cells with zero insertions as a

462
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:15,200
function of age they go down and we're

463
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:18,039
able to fit a Decay length to that which

464
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,360
gives you a clone lifetime of about 40

465
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:24,919
years 36 years okay so this is a Decay

466
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:28,360
length of clones it's not cells cells

467
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:31,200
die cells reproduce but the Clones that

468
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,919
would generated in NE hang around for

469
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,799
about 40 years so that means that if

470
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:38,960
you're about 40 you still have t- cells

471
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:41,760
that were generated before you were born

472
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,600
and this is not just due to the fact

473
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,880
that the naive pole uh contract because

474
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,559
that would be this Decay curve here so

475
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,880
it is actually an

476
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:59,440
observed decay of uh well of the

477
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,240
relative proportion of these uh of these

478
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,960
zero insertion cells which allows us to

479
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,000
estimate a lifetime and we'll get back

480
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,919
and will get back to estimating

481
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,640
lifetimes late okay so we already

482
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:15,159
mentioned

483
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,919
selection uh so the first type of

484
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:22,760
selection so after generating receptors

485
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:26,240
uh they first basically undergo an exam

486
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,840
which we call which is a way of thinking

487
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,400
about fix selection so in the Fus before

488
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,960
they let out into the prolifer they get

489
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,760
asked two questions do you bind to

490
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,000
anything at all if they don't bind to

491
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,000
anything at all uh you're going to

492
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,840
discard these cells because they're

493
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,279
probably going to be bad receptors but

494
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,520
if you bind too strongly to self ER

495
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:51,760
proteins you're also going to discard

496
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,919
them so why is the Fus a good place to

497
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,600
test this in principle the Fus is a pure

498
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,760
organ and you should only have receptors

499
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,799
that are specific

500
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,240
to that are produced sorry proteins that

501
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,279
are produced by your body you should

502
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,919
only have self proteins so by basically

503
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,360
being presented different proteins in

504
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:15,600
the Fus uh you the immune system

505
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,799
performs this discrimination tasks there

506
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,799
on your own self proteins and only T

507
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:23,400
cells that don't bind too strongly to

508
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:25,840
self but bind to some extent are LED out

509
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,480
into the periphery and then they undergo

510
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,279
somatic selection which we already

511
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,159
described this prif prepation for when

512
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:35,919
they encounter an antigen and otherwise

513
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,559
de so we can for any of these selection

514
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,840
processes we can also build a

515
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,039
probabilistic model and we can quantify

516
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,440
selection basically knowing what is the

517
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,880
probability of generation generating a

518
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,200
given sequence if we then look in the

519
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:53,279
functional repertoire for example in the

520
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,960
naive repertoire to quantify fic

521
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,880
selection uh we can say that there is

522
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:03,640
some selection factor which we we can

523
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:06,039
describe by some uh by by by a function

524
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,559
and then this can be an linear model

525
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:11,080
such just shown here where we basically

526
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:14,159
say that selection independently acts on

527
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,480
the V Gene J Gene and each of the amino

528
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,960
acids in between because this is this

529
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,919
forms the cdr3 region which is the most

530
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,360
variable region and often doesn't have

531
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,640
that's where all the insertions and

532
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:31,039
deletions happened or we can build a

533
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,640
neural net nwork model or any sort of

534
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,440
machine learning model that accounts for

535
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,640
nonlinear effects and so we've been done

536
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,679
both of

537
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:44,080
these uh and you know there's small

538
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,559
differences and essentially linear

539
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,600
models given the amounts of data that

540
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,399
are available usually do uh as well

541
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,840
there are some things we're able to pick

542
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:58,679
up with the Deep uh with the neural Nets

543
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,559
but it's it really depends on the on the

544
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,760
deepness of the data but at the end of

545
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:06,200
the day what we have is since we've

546
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,760
characterized generation and selection

547
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,559
we know the probability of giving of

548
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:15,200
seeing a given t- cell in a naive

549
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:17,480
repertoire and then uh we can talk about

550
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,520
the start asking questions about

551
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,760
functional repertoire so the plot I

552
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,159
showed you previously was an example of

553
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,440
that but we can ask it at the level of

554
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:31,960
functional repertoire we can ask how

555
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:35,200
many cells are shed by two individuals

556
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,080
10 individuals 100 individuals and so on

557
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,720
and uh we have the model prediction

558
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,279
which is basically the probability of

559
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,000
the sequence being generated in one

560
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:47,000
person and another so say in you and in

561
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,320
me we generate these sequences

562
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,399
independently so that's just P gen

563
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,559
squared times the probability that they

564
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:56,919
were selected in each of us again we're

565
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,880
independent processes so it's the

566
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,840
probability that was selected you and

567
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,000
selected in me and I can build a

568
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,720
separate model for you and I can build a

569
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,240
separate model in for me or we can build

570
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,520
a general model believing that fic

571
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,200
selection is still a somewhat Universal

572
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:16,640
process of course there are differences

573
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,799
for those of you that know uh about MHC

574
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,679
presentation for T cells and so on

575
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,760
either way we can build a model like

576
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:25,919
this and we can see that the model

577
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,600
predicts very well the sharing that we

578
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,080
observe in the data so the fact that you

579
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:35,039
and I share naive

580
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:37,880
sequences is still largely governed by

581
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:42,039
chance for the most part in healthy

582
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:44,080
people now we talked about I I mean we

583
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:48,200
talked about I talked about because I'm

584
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:51,159
soone talking but I mentioned MHC so t-

585
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,120
cells when they recognize a protein it's

586
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:56,200
presented on the major on a scaffold

587
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,880
which is called the MHC or major hyto

588
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,640
compatibility complex this is scaffold

589
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,720
that's encoded by the most polymorphic

590
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:08,360
Gene in the genome the hlaa so it is a

591
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,440
great source of diversity so we are

592
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,440
slightly different so if we build a

593
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:17,600
common model for people we may need to

594
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:20,960
include a sort of small selection factor

595
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:25,480
that is person dependent or group

596
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:28,960
dependent and so uh basically this will

597
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,520
tell us that the higher the fact

598
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,799
the closer it is to one one the less

599
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,799
stringent selection on a specific sub

600
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,840
subsystem or sub group of people and the

601
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:42,440
closer to zero the more stringent

602
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,000
selection and here we looked at how it

603
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,720
varies over different categories so we

604
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
can see that it looks different for

605
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:53,000
people that are CMV negative or positive

606
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,080
CMV is a huge influence of how immune

607
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,760
report was look like and we see that it

608
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,159
varies with age so basic basically as

609
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,240
you get older you have more Str you have

610
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:09,480
more signatures of more stringent

611
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:13,799
selection in in your uh

612
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,559
repertoire and uh so we can again go

613
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:17,880
back this is a different representation

614
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:20,720
of what I was showing you about whether

615
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,399
we can predict and this is related to

616
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,360
this um to the this r factor that I

617
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,120
showed before which basically was

618
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,399
measuring how well we could have

619
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,720
predicted in that set of individuals we

620
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:37,320
looked at uh which is from a different

621
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:40,240
sequencing platform than this uh but you

622
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:43,600
can see that we're doing very well at

623
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,720
predicting sharing in healthy

624
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,640
individuals with this selection factor

625
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,640
for t- cells same thing for B cells we

626
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,120
have smaller data sizes but it works

627
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:59,519
very well but if we looked at people who

628
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:02,640
recently had a sasco 2 infection and

629
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:05,960
this was a people for whom this was a

630
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,640
first infection we see significant

631
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,880
outlines we see that these people share

632
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,679
many more B cell receptors than

633
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,880
predicted by chance so this tells us

634
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,919
that by looking at sharing and people

635
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,440
we're actually able to pick up some

636
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,159
signal and this brings me to the second

637
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,279
part of my talk where I want to talk

638
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,679
about the fact that what we're

639
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:28,679
interested in now is basically looking

640
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,679
for

641
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:35,080
specific signals in the repertoire H

642
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:38,360
stack so the repertoire is a very large

643
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:41,799
system some very small fraction much

644
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,720
smaller than drawn here is spe is used

645
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:46,120
in a specific disease or condition

646
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:49,679
setting and an even smallest part of

647
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,440
that is used in uh to identify specific

648
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:57,360
antigens and we would like to know

649
00:29:52,440 --> 00:30:01,279
precisely what this is or more likely

650
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,000
statistically what this is so can we use

651
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,360
this notion of

652
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,679
sharing and to try and

653
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:12,799
identify sequences that are specific for

654
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,440
given conditions and the answer is yes

655
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:17,000
so here what we're showing is a

656
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,559
prediction of how many TCR should be

657
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,120
shed between people and how many are

658
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:25,399
actually shed between people in

659
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:29,360
conditions that are diabet diabetes and

660
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:31,919
CMV infection and the red dots so this

661
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,880
is an inverted version of the previous

662
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,799
plot with the red dots being significant

663
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,679
outliers and the ones in a circle are

664
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:44,360
ones that were experimentally validated

665
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:47,360
to be associated with this condition um

666
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:51,559
in Pre in previous experiments so we can

667
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,799
actually identify disease related TCR

668
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:56,039
without having a negative cohort so

669
00:30:53,799 --> 00:31:00,600
people who don't have this

670
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:02,799
condition if we go to s back to sasco V2

671
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,480
uh from different data sets we also have

672
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:08,120
these significant

673
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:12,039
outliers uh this is we can identify

674
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:16,200
motifs left to the linked to them and we

675
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:18,559
can connect this is for tcrs now uh

676
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,399
where we can also identify them we can

677
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:25,440
link tcrs that differ by at most one

678
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:29,080
Amino asset and again using vdj DB we

679
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,840
can link them to what sasco two epitopes

680
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,639
they correspond

681
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:37,519
to um and identify the logos and see

682
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:40,360
where the the variability is and if we

683
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:44,039
go back to BCS which is by doing a

684
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:46,519
simple log likelihood ratio test we can

685
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:49,159
identify whether some basically looking

686
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:51,519
at somebody's t- cells looking at the

687
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:55,000
subset of them we can say whether this

688
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:58,000
person had sasco V2 or didn't have sasco

689
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,320
V2 with perfect identifiability

690
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,799
for t- cells we need to do logistic

691
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,320
regression but by doing that we're also

692
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,279
able to do it another thing that it

693
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,200
allows us to do is to HLA type

694
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:14,360
individuals so in short just by looking

695
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,960
at the T Cell somebody has and Having

696
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,120
learned a model which I'll tell you

697
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,519
about in a second we're able to say what

698
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,840
HLA type that person has so what we did

699
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:27,960
is we curated a database of t- cells

700
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,000
that are associated

701
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:34,440
that are strongly associated with a

702
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:38,039
given HLA type so HLA type plus plus

703
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:42,200
negative donors for different HLA types

704
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:44,360
and uh from different data sets and well

705
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,720
we confirmed that the strong Association

706
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:52,639
goes in the way we expect meaning that

707
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:54,639
hla1 uh is mainly that that cd8 is

708
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:58,039
mainly associated with over

709
00:32:54,639 --> 00:33:02,000
representation of hla1 types and CD for

710
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:05,120
with hl2 types the differences here are

711
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,519
not errors because we know that the same

712
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,639
cdr3 and cd8 and CD4 can be uh

713
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,279
associated with

714
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:17,240
hla1 sorry the same cdr3 can be

715
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:21,120
associated with CD4 and

716
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:25,399
cd8 uh so this is not necessarily errors

717
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:28,200
it it can be real and then we

718
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:31,799
build based on this data we build a

719
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:35,000
logistic regression model uh to figure

720
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:38,919
out basically what is the HLA type given

721
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:44,360
on presence of absence of those strongly

722
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:47,080
uh uh identified or Associated tcrs and

723
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:50,559
you can see that whether we use just one

724
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:53,519
change is the alpha or the beta or both

725
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:57,159
of them we have very good performance

726
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,000
now what's interesting is that this is

727
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:02,559
just used

728
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,720
saying that a given TC we have to see an

729
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:10,159
identical match in our database to in in

730
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,159
our individual to basically call an HLA

731
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:16,720
type now if we become a little bit less

732
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:19,919
strict and say what if we uh allow for a

733
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,320
one amino acid mismatch in the TCR with

734
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,919
sitting in the person from the one that

735
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,240
we know is associated to given HLA type

736
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:32,240
uh it turns out that we actually do

737
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:34,000
slightly better with this one mismatch

738
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:38,240
with slightly above the diagonal then we

739
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,720
just allow for single mismatches and so

740
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,159
pushing this a little bit further we can

741
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:48,440
build clusters for different this is for

742
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:51,159
different HL a groups of tcrs that

743
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,440
differ by at most one amino acids and we

744
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:56,160
see that they cluster into these sets

745
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,440
that then through again vjb we can

746
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:02,960
associate with specific known uh

747
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,760
epitopes so that tells us that similar

748
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,720
tcrs have uh the same HLA restriction

749
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,480
and bind similar or the same epitopes

750
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:15,119
which is a which tells us that the

751
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:18,760
information that is in a TCR repertoire

752
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:22,680
alone can help us refine presentation

753
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,920
models but also binding models so

754
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,960
basically there's a lot of information

755
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:31,560
in TCR similarity and it does seem to be

756
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,880
an important element which see we see

757
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:39,119
over and over again which we like to exp

758
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:42,079
exploit and so pushing with that can we

759
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,760
actually identify responding tcrs using

760
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,760
just a single

761
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,359
reper and so to do this and I'll show we

762
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,720
did this both on T cells and on B cells

763
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:55,480
I'll show you the B cell version just

764
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,119
for a change we can take a repertoire

765
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,680
which has been exposed to a given

766
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,800
antigen and then we can build clusters

767
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:07,079
of similar

768
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:09,880
BCR and uh then what we do is we prune

769
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:13,319
these clusters for what we expect based

770
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:17,880
on P gen basically we expect some

771
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:20,119
similarity in the data uh we expect

772
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,599
these clusters to be there naturally

773
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:24,720
because some BC have a higher

774
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,640
probability of being generated and

775
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,839
they're usually ones with small

776
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,319
insertions so the ones that are short

777
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,400
and with small Solutions are more likely

778
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:37,000
to be there so we need to correct for

779
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,800
that but once we correct for that we're

780
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,280
able to actually use this as a way of uh

781
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:48,400
identifying bcrs so we took data from

782
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:51,359
Steve Quakes lab from horad dool and um

783
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:55,200
for people who received the flu vaccine

784
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:59,319
at different types and if we just look

785
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,839
at frequencies or of count of different

786
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:05,800
VCS before and after vaccination we

787
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:07,200
don't see big differences however if we

788
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,920
look at

789
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,720
how basically how how what abundant the

790
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:18,160
neighborhoods are we see that the after

791
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,960
vaccination we see larger neighborhoods

792
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:26,680
which means we see bigger clusters so we

793
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:29,400
can postulate that these larger or uh um

794
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,480
these be pcrs that have more neighbors

795
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,880
are potentially

796
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,720
responding and so we see this clear Peak

797
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,720
if we look at different individuals at

798
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:44,560
day seven post infection and uh in one

799
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:48,560
individual we can build uh a network of

800
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,319
close by but unrated sequences meaning

801
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:55,720
they use different

802
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:59,160
V uh even if they share similar CDR

803
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:00,640
frees and we really see that they have

804
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,880
different

805
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,920
origin uh have a different origin

806
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,240
because they although they share this

807
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,880
the ones that share exactly this

808
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,359
specific cdf3 sequence they're encoded

809
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:18,200
by very different V that could not have

810
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:21,079
been confused by chance so we see

811
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:24,359
convergence of a response we see a

812
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:28,040
convergent response uh of clones that

813
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:31,119
were independently generated to the flu

814
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:35,079
vaccines in bcrs so I'm saying I'm out

815
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:38,119
of time here uh should I

816
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:41,040
stop are we we had some questions uh

817
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:43,079
during the talk so I think that that's

818
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,280
you can probably uh find a continue for

819
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:46,839
a little bit I think that's s all right

820
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,359
so let you have more questions I think

821
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:53,359
we can uh go as we go okay so let so

822
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,960
this is the last thing I want to say

823
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,359
sort of going back to this self versus

824
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,800
nonself question

825
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:05,680
um so that that HP you know that is

826
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,960
presumably is decided during fic

827
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,400
selection so the way I mean we like to

828
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,880
think of it following Ellen Pearson's

829
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,359
shapes space idea is that TCS and

830
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,000
pathogens live in the same abstract

831
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:20,400
space we don't know what it is it's some

832
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,319
sort of phenotypic space and the name of

833
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,960
the game for TCR and bcrs as well is to

834
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:28,760
cover the whole Space because pathogens

835
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:31,359
can be anywhere but you don't want to

836
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,960
put a TCR in a place where you have your

837
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,800
own proteins so these are sort of

838
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,680
forbidden regions in black but you need

839
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,680
to cover all of the space all all of

840
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:47,119
this space

841
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:50,359
so uh in that sense can we find features

842
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,440
in t- cell receptors that are able to

843
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:56,000
discriminate foreign and self peptide so

844
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,640
in other words can we find features in

845
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,160
te- cells in cell receptors that

846
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,160
basically tell us that this is a

847
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,160
forbidden region are there some sort of

848
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,520
features that are forbidden I mean maybe

849
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,240
that's the simplest way of saying that

850
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,000
so we already talked about fic selection

851
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,640
that you have to select for them being

852
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,880
functional so binding to anything but

853
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,359
self- tolerant so not binding to your

854
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,880
own self

855
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:24,520
proteins H and so this is a Hu process

856
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,040
that takes around is very fast it takes

857
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,440
around four to five days and so a root

858
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,640
check roboti back in the day did a

859
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,560
calculation where basically the outcome

860
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,560
of it is that there's not enough time

861
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:42,000
for this so given the number of self

862
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:45,319
peptides if each t- cell has to see all

863
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,640
possible self peptides given the number

864
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:50,440
of APC molecules so antigen presenting

865
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,720
molecules so the ones basically with the

866
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:57,319
scaffold that present these peptides to

867
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:59,920
t- cells uh there's no way that a T cell

868
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:04,319
can see all peptides it sees at best a

869
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:07,720
few thousands so it probes a small

870
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:09,680
fraction of possible self petti so

871
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,880
remember if this thing is set up in a

872
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,560
way that you're supposed to actually

873
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,319
learn make you know a list of everything

874
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,160
you're not supposed to recognize a t-

875
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,640
cell there's basically no time to make

876
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:24,119
the list and the second thing is we know

877
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:26,119
it's a leaky process so T-Rex are

878
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:29,000
examples of te- cells that bind to your

879
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:30,680
own proteins they go through this so we

880
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,640
know it doesn't work and of course we

881
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:37,800
know we do get autoimmune diseases so

882
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,680
how systematic is the TCR elimination

883
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:44,359
and again do we see signals of this

884
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:46,520
inter sequence so to investigate this we

885
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:52,760
set up an experiment with Neo freedman's

886
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:54,800
lab in mice where uh we had two markers

887
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,520
an activation marker basically over the

888
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,079
cell is responding to something and a

889
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:01,720
sellev mark

890
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,359
and we sequence t- cells not just in the

891
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:08,280
periphery as we usually do so functional

892
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:10,599
t- cells but throughout fic selection so

893
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,560
there's different cell types throughout

894
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:15,839
fic selection and at each decision of

895
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,520
whether the cell gets to proceed or

896
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:20,559
whether it gets

897
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,920
eliminated uh we sequence the ones that

898
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:26,240
passed and the ones that failed so in

899
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,440
you know either you care about these

900
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,200
different stages and you know about it

901
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,880
but essentially what we do is we have a

902
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,520
bunch of examples that passed and failed

903
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,559
different stages during fic selection

904
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,720
and specifically I'm going to really

905
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:45,000
focus on this last stage whether they're

906
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:50,800
Leed out of the periphery orever they

907
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:52,079
apoptose at this late stage so um so

908
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,920
what we're going to do then is we're

909
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,119
going to build again a Model A selection

910
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,119
model that takes us from generation to

911
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,440
the given stage of fic selection that

912
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:05,359
we're looking at to the given pass or

913
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:08,839
fail and we're going to build these

914
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:12,800
models uh and for basically the pass and

915
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:16,920
failed roups now if we just look at the

916
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,960
data uh even before learning a model we

917
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,160
don't see huge differences say this is

918
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,400
in V

919
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:26,880
usage uh between the different types and

920
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,280
again the similar colors like the pinky

921
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,559
color colors are the ones the the the

922
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,599
lighter one is the one that passed the

923
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,680
darker one is the one that failed same

924
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:40,640
for the orange and basically Geniuses is

925
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:44,359
really driven by the probability of

926
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:47,520
generation uh and there are definitely

927
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:52,800
not differences between the past and the

928
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:55,880
failed ones um H however if we put all

929
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,280
different if if we basically do a PCA

930
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,559
analysis on the different cell types

931
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,040
they do cluster in a way that we expect

932
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:05,599
so first they generate it then they go

933
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,880
into this double positive and they break

934
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:12,760
up separately into CD4 and cd8 but again

935
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:15,440
the ones that pass and fail are very

936
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:19,440
close together and with these models we

937
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,960
are able to reproduce largely again the

938
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,559
similarities that we expect from biology

939
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:28,400
so we are capturing something which is

940
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:32,359
not capturing some sort of Smoking Gun

941
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,800
so we ask the qu but what do we expect

942
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:37,280
we basically you know thinking about it

943
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,200
as passing and failing we basically

944
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,400
expect that these two subsets should be

945
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,880
mutually exclusive so the energy

946
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:48,400
functions that we learn from them should

947
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,359
be anti-correlated meaning that if I

948
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,680
take a property such as length and I put

949
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:56,640
a threshold here then I call some of

950
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,559
these t- cells long and some of them

951
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,480
short

952
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:04,200
and I buil a separate model for the long

953
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:07,119
ones and the short ones well a T cell is

954
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:10,640
either long or it's short so if I then

955
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,520
score the all the cells with the long

956
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:14,880
with the short functions the ones that

957
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,760
were actually short will score high but

958
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,160
the ones that were uh long will score

959
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,119
poorly with the short function but well

960
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,240
with the long function and vice versa so

961
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:26,160
we're going to get an

962
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,839
anti-correlation however even with such

963
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,920
a strong anti correlation we may get a

964
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:35,119
pretty weak signal of false positive

965
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,680
versus true positive now let's see what

966
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:41,880
we get for this sort of energy

967
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:45,920
anti-correlation on our past fail of CD4

968
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:49,400
cd8 and this is what we get so this is

969
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:51,359
CD4 here the ones that failed and the

970
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,920
ones that passed and were functional

971
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:55,520
same thing for the cd8 and we see that

972
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,440
they're completely

973
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:04,160
correlated so we it's the opposite of

974
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:06,720
what we um expect now just to show that

975
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:10,000
not everything would be correlated the

976
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,599
ones that die by neglect very early on

977
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:16,960
they're just a random subset of both the

978
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:19,480
cd4s and the cd8s so here we're really

979
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,559
seeing that they're selected they seem

980
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:26,960
to be selected for the same thing and so

981
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:32,240
maybe not surprisingly then the uh area

982
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:36,200
and the uh rck curve is close to random

983
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:38,400
so this is for the CD4 cd8 choice so

984
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:41,280
basically what does this mean it means

985
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,440
like if I have a bucket of cells of CD4

986
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,520
cells that passed fic selection and a

987
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:49,480
bucket that failed and if I put my hand

988
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:53,480
in I and pick one T cell at random and

989
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:55,359
I'm asked did I pick it from uh the the

990
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,680
bucket that failed or the bucket that

991
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,760
passed I can't really

992
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,760
detail

993
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,920
however if I now take 30 cells so I do

994
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,640
the same experiment I put my hand in but

995
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,559
now I pick out 30 unique t- cells from

996
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:15,079
the same bucket I am able to pretty well

997
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,200
say whether they've passed or failed and

998
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:18,359
if I pick a 100 I have perfect

999
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,440
discriminability

1000
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:24,520
so and the the threshold is around a

1001
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:27,359
thir T cells which is a similar order of

1002
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,680
magnitude that we've previously seen for

1003
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:32,680
t- cell decision making in another

1004
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,760
context in the transition to in the

1005
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:37,079
decision whether to become a memory t-

1006
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:40,839
cells that was verified using

1007
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:43,920
microfluidics experiment uh by mial Pon

1008
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:45,559
ski News Group at the time so here they

1009
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,599
clearly showed this some sort of

1010
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:50,040
collective decision making and quum

1011
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,960
sensing rules what we're showing with

1012
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:56,359
this is not that we're just saying that

1013
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:59,000
in one TCR there's not enough signal to

1014
00:47:56,359 --> 00:48:02,920
decide whether it should die or live but

1015
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,839
in 30 tcrs there is and so this is

1016
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:07,480
something we're trying to understand and

1017
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:10,440
we don't fully understand this was so

1018
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:14,200
far done on single cells we did sorry on

1019
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:19,400
single chains we separately did um Alpha

1020
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:22,400
and betas the signal is the same uh it's

1021
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:26,119
so maybe there is more signal in

1022
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:30,839
both but that doesn't explain why we

1023
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:34,319
start having having signal when uh we we

1024
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:37,000
go to 30 even with a single cell anyway

1025
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:38,839
that's the last thing I wanted to say so

1026
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,920
probably the most important thing I want

1027
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:44,960
to say is don't kill anyone even if you

1028
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:48,559
have an identical twin they seem to us

1029
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:51,000
like a sort of you know fun twist but it

1030
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:54,920
turns out that murderous twins is

1031
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:58,280
actually a serious problem in the world

1032
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:02,319
um and basically figuring out which twin

1033
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:05,280
did it so people do care about that uh I

1034
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:07,640
showed you how by looking at statistical

1035
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,960
prop properties in repertoire such as

1036
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:13,319
overlap between individuals or in-host

1037
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,240
convergence were're able to identify

1038
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:17,760
responding clonotypes and and will tell

1039
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,640
you how we can do this using

1040
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:24,119
longitudinal data and for fic selection

1041
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,880
we at a point where we were unable to

1042
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:29,079
find any deterministic rules for TCR

1043
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,960
rejection so we believe there are some

1044
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:33,960
again either Collective or statistical

1045
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,200
rules that we're interested in looking

1046
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,200
for so thank

1047
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:46,799
you so it's a pleasure to give a seminar

1048
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,760
here um okay so yeah I will I will

1049
00:49:46,799 --> 00:49:51,440
present some some like more details

1050
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:52,799
about uh quantification of the immune

1051
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,440
receptor

1052
00:49:52,799 --> 00:49:59,319
Dynamics um it's basically I will talk

1053
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:01,799
about a couple three Works done in the

1054
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:03,839
group of alexand I'm not the main the

1055
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:07,799
main author of all of them but I'm quite

1056
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:08,839
familiar with those um and so in general

1057
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:11,799
okay

1058
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:14,760
the kind of Alexander already talked a

1059
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:18,240
lot about Rec combination and selection

1060
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:21,079
but for us uh now what's important is

1061
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,440
like after those processes so uh in our

1062
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:26,839
body then we will have like a pool of t

1063
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:29,520
cels or and or B cells uh with like a

1064
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:33,359
lot of uh different receptors and to

1065
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:35,599
give some numbers um we can have like uh

1066
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:37,640
around 10 power 11 total cells in our

1067
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,359
body and the diversity of these

1068
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:42,480
receptors so in this case the number of

1069
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:44,520
different colors can can it's not super

1070
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,359
easy to estimate this number but it can

1071
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:50,880
range from 10 Power 8 to 10 power

1072
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:52,160
10 um and so we are interested in

1073
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,079
understanding how this kind of

1074
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:57,920
composition changes in time and which

1075
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:59,599
kind of factor uh make those

1076
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,839
changes

1077
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:05,960
um okay so just to uh to list a couple

1078
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:10,079
of like mechanism that can change the

1079
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:13,040
repertoire composition so of course uh

1080
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:15,280
uh there is cell dep as Alexander said

1081
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,280
and there is also influx influx of new

1082
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,640
cells through Rec combination and

1083
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,400
selection and here I just mention

1084
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,520
without entering too much into details

1085
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,839
the fact that cells can also

1086
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,440
differentiate so in in the case for

1087
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:30,599
example of memory cells they can take a

1088
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:33,480
decision of becoming memory cells that

1089
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:36,400
keep immunological memory or to become

1090
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:40,240
cells that produce plasma

1091
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:43,319
antibodies but um there are also those

1092
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:47,440
kind of under undergoing

1093
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:51,200
processes and in addition um as also

1094
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:54,480
Alexandra said if uh like one cell in

1095
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:58,000
this repertoire encounter a um an

1096
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,359
antigen a pathogen uh which is close

1097
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,200
enough to its shape that is able to bind

1098
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:05,440
to it basically this can start an

1099
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,960
expansion an expansion of the cell and

1100
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,280
so the cell starts to duplicate and grow

1101
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:13,160
exponentially and in the specific case

1102
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,960
of B cells uh there can also be what's

1103
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,640
called Affinity maturation so basically

1104
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:22,200
the cell that's good enough to recognize

1105
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:25,359
the pathogen also starts to mutate the

1106
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:28,760
receptor and the mutated receptor after

1107
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:32,079
duplication uh are tested against the

1108
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,799
antigen and selected for being good at

1109
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:36,440
binding the antigen so basically there

1110
00:52:33,799 --> 00:52:40,640
is a really like evolutionary process

1111
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:43,119
that creates better and better receptors

1112
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,839
so we have like this this collection of

1113
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:48,799
processes and we would like to better

1114
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:52,079
understand like how these processes uh

1115
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:54,720
happen uh in healthy conditions so

1116
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,880
basically if we don't have any like

1117
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,520
measure disease

1118
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,760
we can expect that also in hetic

1119
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,599
conditions there are cell expansions

1120
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,839
because probably there are antigens in

1121
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:08,839
our body and also Affinity mation can

1122
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:10,680
happen also maybe those cells can react

1123
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:12,960
to the microbiome of our

1124
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,400
body uh so we would like to understand

1125
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:19,000
how this happens in healthy conditions

1126
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:22,160
and uh also what happens uh in response

1127
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,000
to a specific stimulus and what really

1128
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,559
uh what what really I mean is different

1129
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,960
between responding to a specific

1130
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:33,200
stimulus and from from the sort of like

1131
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:37,920
uh Baseline uh kind of

1132
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:40,799
Dynamics okay and um so this kind of uh

1133
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:44,440
idea can be schematized as follow so you

1134
00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:45,960
can imagine that now in my body um I as

1135
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,880
I told you there are a lot of receptors

1136
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:52,760
and you can like just count the number

1137
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:56,640
of uh cells having the same receptor so

1138
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:58,960
I will call a color from now on a clone

1139
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:02,160
so basically the Clone the purple clone

1140
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,079
has abundance count three and I can

1141
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,960
track keep track of those numbers in

1142
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,040
time and I want to study the variation

1143
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:11,200
of those numbers in

1144
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:13,359
time and uh okay so the kind of question

1145
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:15,920
we want to address are based on like

1146
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:18,240
understanding how this variation changes

1147
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,839
but the problem is that like what makes

1148
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,079
this kind of inference this kind of

1149
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:25,599
quantification hard is the fact that I

1150
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:27,880
cannot really uh know these these

1151
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,680
numbers because actually what I can know

1152
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:34,520
are just sequencing experiments so just

1153
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:37,480
subset of the of the real uh of the real

1154
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:39,960
receptors and again to give some

1155
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:44,160
numbers I Told You So if there are like

1156
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:47,040
10 power 11 cells in a body um the the

1157
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:49,920
number of cells that there will be in an

1158
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:52,520
experiment can range from 10 power 5 to

1159
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,319
10 power s so you can really see that's

1160
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,960
it's like really an infinitesimal

1161
00:54:54,319 --> 00:55:01,119
fraction of the real number of

1162
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,599
cells and in addition uh experiments can

1163
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,640
introduce errors there are amplification

1164
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,559
biases if there is

1165
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:11,880
PCR uh so this like really makes this

1166
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:17,160
this kind of U quantification

1167
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:20,599
non-trivial and um so as um as a matter

1168
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:23,880
of notation from now on I will call n

1169
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:27,000
Prime the the experimental counts and N

1170
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:30,960
without a prime the real counts and in

1171
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,680
general I can write down uh a a given

1172
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,760
probability of of observing an

1173
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:38,880
experimental count given the real count

1174
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:42,280
and I will call this the noise model and

1175
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,880
some some I will I won't enter much into

1176
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:47,319
details of how those kind of noise model

1177
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,920
can be and how to learn them but in

1178
00:55:47,319 --> 00:55:52,079
general they can be like for example

1179
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:55,079
aonian model so aonian model would be

1180
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:57,559
like uh to model like a pure sampling I

1181
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:59,079
just I'm just sampling receptors from

1182
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:01,000
this

1183
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:03,000
set of course the de probity

1184
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,400
distribution is a binomial but can be

1185
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,799
well described by a poonian because of

1186
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:11,280
the big numbers uh otherwise if like the

1187
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:14,119
the there are like amplification errors

1188
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:17,480
people usually also use uh negative

1189
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:22,039
binomials that are like broader

1190
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:24,640
distributions okay and um and some some

1191
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:27,000
also important fact it's important to to

1192
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:29,880
like to like know is that the

1193
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:34,480
distributions of those of those numbers

1194
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:36,760
for T cells for B cells uh are power low

1195
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,079
so here I draw actually a perfect power

1196
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,160
law I don't really know if it's a

1197
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:43,200
perfect power law but uh of course it's

1198
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:46,440
a distribution with a very fat tail with

1199
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:51,559
an exponent that's around minus two and

1200
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:53,920
like studying uh experiments that like

1201
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:56,760
basically are sampling from power loss

1202
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,880
brings uh some some kind of problem s if

1203
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,839
you want so basically if I can imagine

1204
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:05,559
my experiment as a sampling from a power

1205
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:07,359
low of course I I I know I can know I

1206
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:09,520
pretty well I can characterize pretty

1207
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:12,240
well the behavior of the common clones

1208
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,280
because are easy to be sampled there

1209
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,319
will be less error because they are more

1210
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:19,640
abundant but I don't I I cannot know

1211
00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:21,760
much about rare clones and the problem

1212
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:25,359
is that in my case also the majority of

1213
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,599
my clones will be rare So basically uh

1214
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:29,480
it's going to be hard to make an

1215
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:30,960
inference on most the majority of of the

1216
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:34,000
Clones in my

1217
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,240
body okay so these like are mostly

1218
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,240
General

1219
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,240
facts

1220
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,680
um I will like now go more into details

1221
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,799
and divide the presentation like in

1222
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,520
three

1223
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:52,520
topics um I will try

1224
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:53,680
to to cover all the three topics uh I

1225
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,799
don't know if I have time for the third

1226
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,520
one we will see and so what's what's

1227
00:57:55,799 --> 00:57:59,160
make the the topics difference is like

1228
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,920
the conditions in which we want to study

1229
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,680
the Dynamics of the repertoire so we

1230
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:06,039
will start from healthy Dynamics then we

1231
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,960
will go to the response to vaccinations

1232
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:11,440
or infections in general and the third

1233
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:15,000
one is about the coevolution with the

1234
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:18,640
HIV okay

1235
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,640
so uh considering the he Dynamic uh we

1236
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,559
can also have like a more specific

1237
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,880
question more practical question that

1238
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,680
also biology are very interested in that

1239
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:31,520
is the question of like how long I can

1240
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:33,039
expect a clone to survive in time and of

1241
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:36,640
course I mean you can imagine those

1242
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:38,400
number changing in time and uh in

1243
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,760
General on average you can expect a

1244
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,000
clone to decrease its number in time if

1245
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,720
it's not stimulated anymore and so the

1246
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,599
question is how long I can expect this

1247
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:49,480
this process to to happen before

1248
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,319
Extinction and of course this is

1249
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,160
connected also with the storage of

1250
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:56,359
immunological memory so this is why like

1251
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:58,559
it's an important question

1252
00:58:56,359 --> 00:59:00,319
uh but so like a related question and

1253
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,599
sort of like more general question we

1254
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:05,240
would like to to have a model that is

1255
00:59:02,599 --> 00:59:07,680
able to predict more the this kind of

1256
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:10,520
variation of abundances in time in

1257
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:12,760
absence of like strong

1258
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:16,319
stimul so

1259
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:18,480
um I will start by presenting like uh

1260
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:22,000
some sort of like qualitative approach

1261
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:24,599
that people already did several times in

1262
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:26,839
in the in the in the past that just

1263
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:28,920
allows us to say that it's true that the

1264
00:59:26,839 --> 00:59:32,400
actually the the repertoire the Clones

1265
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:34,400
are quite stable in time so the kind of

1266
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,280
like qualitative easy approach is the

1267
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:39,559
following you can imagine that a patient

1268
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:43,440
is uh sequenced two

1269
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:46,400
times and then what I do is simply just

1270
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,520
counting the number of clones I find at

1271
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,839
time one the number of clones I find at

1272
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:54,240
time two and the number of common clones

1273
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:58,200
and I can easily then they find like

1274
00:59:54,240 --> 01:00:00,119
some sort of measure that uh that like

1275
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:03,520
contains the fraction of common clones

1276
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:05,920
over the uh the product of the uh number

1277
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,400
of unique clones at the two time points

1278
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:09,440
so you can already see that actually

1279
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:13,240
those numbers

1280
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:15,640
are uh if you want sort of surprising so

1281
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:17,480
if you really think that clones are very

1282
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,599
stable you would expect to find many

1283
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,280
more common clones so here the fraction

1284
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,559
of common clones is not very big

1285
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:27,480
compared to the fract the the unique

1286
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:29,119
clones that you have but like the reason

1287
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,119
here is that you have power lows if you

1288
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:33,680
remember and therefore when you sample

1289
01:00:32,119 --> 01:00:35,799
most of the time you will sample rare

1290
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:38,440
clones it's very hard to sample the same

1291
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:40,760
rare clone twice so that's the reason

1292
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:44,319
why your signal usually will be

1293
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:46,680
dominated by uh unit cles but so you

1294
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:48,119
have this number here and then you can

1295
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:51,119
like compare this

1296
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:52,799
number in in in the second with with the

1297
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,280
second number so basically you repeat

1298
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:56,440
the same procedure but you do it with

1299
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,200
the replicates so like

1300
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:01,559
different experiments but in the same

1301
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:04,119
biological conditions you will get like

1302
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:06,599
again a fraction of common clones and

1303
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:08,000
you can compare those two numbers in

1304
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:10,359
your

1305
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,119
uh uh and you will see that actually

1306
01:01:10,359 --> 01:01:16,440
doesn't change much so basically uh if

1307
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:18,039
you consider samples after 10 years uh

1308
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,039
it will be like more or less the same

1309
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:22,920
fraction of common clones that they will

1310
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:24,799
have uh between like replicates in the

1311
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,520
same condition so this is really saying

1312
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:29,799
that the repertoire in in this case it

1313
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:31,760
was like data from memory B cells the

1314
01:01:29,799 --> 01:01:34,520
repertoire is quite stable so on a time

1315
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:37,200
span of 10 years it's very easy that I

1316
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:40,000
keep my clone

1317
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:43,240
alive so but that that that's nice we

1318
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,839
want to like uh uh improve a bit this

1319
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:47,359
this kind of result we want to be more

1320
01:01:44,839 --> 01:01:49,680
precise more quantitative and to be more

1321
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:52,160
quantitative uh we will use like a

1322
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:55,520
modeling

1323
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:58,200
approach and uh so what we do is like

1324
01:01:55,520 --> 01:02:01,559
imagine that my repertoire is evolving

1325
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:04,440
like a geometric Brum motion so I will

1326
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:06,480
like like motivate in a couple of slides

1327
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:09,559
why I choose the geometric Bram motion

1328
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,200
just let me describe how it is for those

1329
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:14,119
of you who are not very familiar with

1330
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:18,079
that so it's a stochastic process you

1331
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:21,119
will have here uh this ITA is a is a

1332
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:24,799
gausian noise uh and your abundance will

1333
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:26,400
evolve according to this equation uh and

1334
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:28,440
you have to add like an absorbing

1335
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,839
boundary condition to like model the

1336
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,039
fact that the Clones at some point will

1337
01:02:30,839 --> 01:02:35,039
get

1338
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:38,119
extinct so uh for example you can try to

1339
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:40,039
plot trajectories of this process for

1340
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:42,720
example here on the left in a in a

1341
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:45,640
logarithmic scale so basically this kind

1342
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:51,079
of Cl is special because if you do like

1343
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:53,760
a simple substitution of uh n being the

1344
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:56,680
equal considering the variable logarithm

1345
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,599
of n basically you get back a standard

1346
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,400
Brum motion for which you can solve

1347
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:03,039
everything so basically this makes this

1348
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,920
process completely solvable and so

1349
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:08,039
basically if You observe this like kind

1350
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:10,400
of trajectory in a y logarithmic scale

1351
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:12,559
basically this a normal granum motion

1352
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:15,359
with drift that goes

1353
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:18,200
down and so you will have this like

1354
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:19,440
exponential average Decay with this time

1355
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:23,000
scale

1356
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:25,039
tow um and some kind of fluctuations

1357
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,119
that whose scale is set by this this

1358
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:29,440
parameter Theta

1359
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:32,839
so in in on the right it's exactly the

1360
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:35,200
same trajectories but on a linear scale

1361
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:38,559
and you can observe like these kind of

1362
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:40,400
like big fluctuations giant fluctuations

1363
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,000
that it turns out are important also

1364
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,520
because they are at the origin of the

1365
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,319
power low as I will mention

1366
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:50,920
briefly and

1367
01:03:47,319 --> 01:03:52,680
um okay so and as I told you like

1368
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,480
everything is solvable for the for this

1369
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:57,359
geometric Bram motion even we have not

1370
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:00,720
we absorbing

1371
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:03,160
condition um for example one can compute

1372
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:05,960
the propagator so it's the probability

1373
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:10,200
of observing a given experimental count

1374
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:13,880
at time two given the count at time one

1375
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:17,440
and uh basically if you like you see the

1376
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:19,599
plot on the right if you plot this uh on

1377
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,559
the variable Logan basically this is a

1378
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:24,160
gaan far away from the boundary if you

1379
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:26,520
approach the boundary it will change a

1380
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,160
bit the shape but so in General if I'm

1381
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:30,480
staying far away from the boundary this

1382
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:34,359
is a simple log normal distribution for

1383
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:37,000
n i I have a quick question sure um

1384
01:04:34,359 --> 01:04:40,839
about the N equals one boundary

1385
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:43,760
condition I guess um maybe this this

1386
01:04:40,839 --> 01:04:46,200
model is maybe only valid for a subset

1387
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,839
of cells like memory cells as you were

1388
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:51,200
saying because I feel like in many

1389
01:04:48,839 --> 01:04:54,160
infections you know it's like one clone

1390
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:56,039
that's really expanding so like at the

1391
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,400
at the beginning of an infection or

1392
01:04:56,039 --> 01:05:00,680
something like

1393
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:04,079
that can you just comment a bit on you

1394
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:06,359
know what regime or like subset of cells

1395
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:08,359
this kind of no I mean we here I'm I'm

1396
01:05:06,359 --> 01:05:12,039
really trying to model every cell in the

1397
01:05:08,359 --> 01:05:14,200
body and so I'm really saying like on a

1398
01:05:12,039 --> 01:05:15,880
very simple level I can imagine that

1399
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,839
whatever clones in my body will follow

1400
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:19,160
this

1401
01:05:16,839 --> 01:05:21,240
Dynamics and at some point can get

1402
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:23,119
exting if he hits the boundary n equal

1403
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:26,760
one but of course I mean these numbers

1404
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:29,839
can go up to 10 power 6 10 power

1405
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:33,160
seven but it seems that like you know

1406
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:36,079
every most clones are unique to start

1407
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:39,480
with and then they expand so they yeah

1408
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:41,279
yeah can yeah I mean okay maybe maybe

1409
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:43,160
I'm coming this in the next slide

1410
01:05:41,279 --> 01:05:45,680
because I have I have to pair this kind

1411
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:48,039
of model with like a introdu of an

1412
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:51,079
introduction of new clones with a given

1413
01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:53,240
rate so basically by by me meing the

1414
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:55,440
fact that you have an influx of clones

1415
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:57,359
so every clone will start from a number

1416
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,760
that usually is quite

1417
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:01,920
small but since I have this kind of

1418
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,160
giant fluctuation every clones is

1419
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,640
possible to reach some kind of big level

1420
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,559
and then Decay later so I mean this kind

1421
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:11,160
of model is not really

1422
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:13,200
describing explicitly the expansions

1423
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:15,359
that happening because of like

1424
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:19,480
encountering the antigen of

1425
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:21,079
whatever but um I mean this kind of

1426
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:23,599
expansion are including in this kind of

1427
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:26,839
giant fluctuation that can

1428
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:29,599
happen I see so so n

1429
01:06:26,839 --> 01:06:32,319
Zer is is

1430
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:34,400
approximately what like it's one it's

1431
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:36,160
order I mean if I put exactly equal to

1432
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:41,000
one it doesn't really work but it's

1433
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:42,920
order one yes I see I see okay yeah then

1434
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,160
that makes that makes more sense yeah I

1435
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,440
guess it's just you know for my like

1436
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,640
biologically the intuition would be you

1437
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:50,000
start off with a unique clone but you're

1438
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,359
saying that for this model to work you

1439
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,680
kind of need something close to one but

1440
01:06:52,359 --> 01:06:57,319
not exactly one yeah yeah actually okay

1441
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,000
biologically I don't really know what

1442
01:06:57,319 --> 01:07:05,039
what really happens close to the Border

1443
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:05,039
I mean uh I guess yeah

1444
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:09,200
um but yeah I mean the problem also is

1445
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,680
that like at the end of the day we can

1446
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:14,359
we can really stud study this model

1447
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:16,880
through I mean we can really what we can

1448
01:07:14,359 --> 01:07:19,279
really say about abundances is through

1449
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:22,000
sequencing experiments and I can sample

1450
01:07:19,279 --> 01:07:23,920
only big clones so I can really

1451
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,279
characterize what's what happens in the

1452
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:30,359
power low tail I don't really know what

1453
01:07:26,279 --> 01:07:31,720
happens in the rare clone regime uh as I

1454
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:33,760
told you

1455
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,640
before but yeah

1456
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:39,440
okay

1457
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:42,559
uh so like if I have like this model uh

1458
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,440
that like progressively like leads to

1459
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:47,440
extinction of clones because I have this

1460
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:50,279
negative Decay on time this negative

1461
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:52,000
exponential decay uh and I Caple it with

1462
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:53,799
like introduction of clones at the end I

1463
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,640
have a stationary distribution that's a

1464
01:07:53,799 --> 01:07:59,400
power L and it's like the kind of one of

1465
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,920
main reason why I choose this model so

1466
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:04,200
the power lad that's belied to be

1467
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:07,000
present in in in my in my

1468
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:09,960
repertoire and also like a couple of

1469
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,200
other reason is that simple and solvable

1470
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:16,319
and the third reason is that there are

1471
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:19,480
also like previous works by Alexandra TI

1472
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:23,520
um that were like really studying more

1473
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:26,359
detailed models on how clones interact

1474
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:28,920
with antigens expand and decay

1475
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:31,239
and basically if you take these models

1476
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:33,480
and You observe like you you you you

1477
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:36,120
study this model between two time points

1478
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:37,719
that are sufficiently far away in time

1479
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:40,080
those model they converge to the

1480
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:42,239
geometric Brum motion so basically

1481
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,560
that's an additional reason so you can

1482
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:47,759
see this model like a as a convergence

1483
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:52,759
point for more detail deta detailed

1484
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:56,000
models and if you look at your data uh

1485
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:58,440
between sufficiently separated uh time

1486
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,040
points and by sufficiently separate

1487
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:04,480
sufficiently long separated I mean like

1488
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:07,960
order a few months a

1489
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:10,239
year okay so if like now we believe that

1490
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:11,640
this is the kind of Baseline dynamics

1491
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:14,640
that we are

1492
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:17,480
assuming then we can try to include this

1493
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,480
like in an inference

1494
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:26,120
scheme and so um we imagine that uh my

1495
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:28,880
my unknown real dynamic follow the

1496
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,120
geometric brand and motion from one time

1497
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,359
point to the

1498
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:35,920
other uh but as I told you what I I can

1499
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,799
observe our experiments so basically I

1500
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:42,120
can observe this n Prime that are

1501
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:46,120
generated by my by Noise by my noise uh

1502
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:49,960
by by noise model and um given this

1503
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:51,880
setting basically I can write down um

1504
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:54,040
the probability of observing

1505
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:56,360
experimental counts at time one and

1506
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:59,440
experimental counts at time to for a

1507
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:01,400
given clone I and this will depend on

1508
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:03,640
some parameters that are the parameters

1509
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,320
of my geometric Bram motion and the

1510
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:08,000
parameters of the noise

1511
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:11,199
model so it's nothing very hard here I

1512
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:13,960
just have to marginalize over the hidden

1513
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:16,080
variables and um and at the end of the

1514
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,360
day given this like probability I can

1515
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:21,400
write down a

1516
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:24,640
likelihood so the probability uh of

1517
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:27,360
observing my my my experimental counts

1518
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,920
at the two time points and also by

1519
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,480
assuming that every clone is like

1520
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:33,880
independent in this

1521
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:35,800
case and at the end I can Maxim try to

1522
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:38,480
maximize my likelihood to get my best

1523
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:40,560
parameter that will like fit my

1524
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:44,760
geometric

1525
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:47,719
BR um okay this is like in principle

1526
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,239
doable I just want to mention like a

1527
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:52,719
sort of

1528
01:10:49,239 --> 01:10:53,719
technical important technical Point

1529
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:56,920
that's the

1530
01:10:53,719 --> 01:10:59,000
following uh so basic basically if I try

1531
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:02,960
to to perform this inference this

1532
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:05,440
likelihood maximization by using uh only

1533
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:08,000
two uh experiments at different time

1534
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:10,159
points basically there is a sort of like

1535
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,040
indeterminacy problem I cannot learn at

1536
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:15,719
the same time the noise model and the

1537
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:18,080
geometric BR motion so basically I need

1538
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:21,320
data that have this kind of structure so

1539
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:23,719
I need data that are at different time

1540
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:26,360
points but I Al I also need experiments

1541
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:28,640
that are performed at the same time so I

1542
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:30,520
need the experimental replicates and in

1543
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:32,960
general I will need the experimental

1544
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:36,800
replicates to learn the noise model and

1545
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:38,960
then use the the the longitudinal data

1546
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:41,040
to learn the dynamical model given the

1547
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,719
noise model so this is like sort of

1548
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,320
technical point but it will come back

1549
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,080
later also for the inference of

1550
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:47,719
responding clone it's important to State

1551
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:52,840
it

1552
01:11:47,719 --> 01:11:56,199
out um okay so this is like just

1553
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:58,920
uh to show some results

1554
01:11:56,199 --> 01:12:02,239
uh this was for for a from um

1555
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:04,560
work of of Mariam of like a few years

1556
01:12:02,239 --> 01:12:07,440
ago and basically they are able to learn

1557
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:10,080
these parameters for different patients

1558
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,520
so basically this plot what is actually

1559
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:14,920
saying is

1560
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:16,880
that uh this line is the line that

1561
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:21,320
corresponds to a power low with exponent

1562
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:25,600
two which is what the people believes um

1563
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:27,560
the repertoire sits in and um and you

1564
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,320
can see that your data more or less are

1565
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,760
around this line I don't really know

1566
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:33,880
actually there is a group of points

1567
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:36,120
that's not super close but um it's

1568
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:38,520
probably it's probably a reasonable

1569
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:42,000
exponent anyway probably a more

1570
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:44,800
interesting like result is it's if we

1571
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,560
can look is if if we look directly at

1572
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:52,520
the value of to so basically we can

1573
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:55,800
really here see that my tow goes from a

1574
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:57,760
five years to around 15 20 years so

1575
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:01,120
basically this is really saying that the

1576
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:04,000
T Cel clones are extremely stable so I

1577
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:07,000
remember you this St is the exponential

1578
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,960
decay time so it really means that to

1579
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,880
see a decrease of a factor E I have to

1580
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:16,880
wait 10 years so if I start from a given

1581
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:19,280
abundance after 10 years I the kind of

1582
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,960
like number of cells in the Clone will

1583
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:25,760
be decreased of a factor two or three so

1584
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:28,280
it's a very very uh slow decay and also

1585
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:30,719
it's interesting to see that you can

1586
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:32,760
like plot this point as a function of

1587
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:35,440
the age of the patient and you can

1588
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:38,120
really see that this Stow increases

1589
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:40,239
quite a lot with the age so young

1590
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:43,800
younger patient we have a faster

1591
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:47,239
Decay and uh you can basically try to

1592
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:49,719
connect this Stow with the rate of rate

1593
01:13:47,239 --> 01:13:52,880
of reintroduction of clones so if you

1594
01:13:49,719 --> 01:13:55,480
believe that the total number of cell is

1595
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:58,199
conserved you can basically compute

1596
01:13:55,480 --> 01:14:00,360
what's the toover rate so the rate at

1597
01:13:58,199 --> 01:14:03,800
which I introduce new clones and

1598
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:05,360
basically it scales as the as one/ to

1599
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:08,800
and so basically you can imagine that

1600
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:11,560
like as you wage your turnover rate

1601
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:13,840
slows down so you will have like clones

1602
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:16,000
that live longer but you have like also

1603
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,840
less new clones that will enters your

1604
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,199
body so this is the kind of

1605
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,199
interpretation you can give to this

1606
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:26,679
plot

1607
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:29,080
um okay so that was about this cells uh

1608
01:14:26,679 --> 01:14:32,920
and briefly I would like to also mention

1609
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:36,400
what happens to B cells uh I just need

1610
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:38,080
like a very quick digression on how the

1611
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:42,480
the B cell

1612
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:45,880
responds um and so again we can start

1613
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:49,639
from uh like situation in which uh I

1614
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:52,679
have my pool of beels I'm calling them

1615
01:14:49,639 --> 01:14:56,000
naive beels because they are still not

1616
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:57,880
uh reacting somehow against the antigen

1617
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,440
basically what like an antigen enters

1618
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,440
the body there will be a good uh

1619
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:05,239
receptor that is able to recognize the

1620
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:08,440
antigen and what happens is that on a

1621
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:10,480
time scale of of some days those naive B

1622
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:13,520
cells they can differentiate into plasma

1623
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:16,880
blasts and Plasma Blast they can attack

1624
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:19,199
the pathogen through

1625
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,440
antibodies uh otherwise like a sort of

1626
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:24,400
different Pathways is that like after

1627
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:25,600
weeks or months those naive B cells

1628
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,480
initialize

1629
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:33,639
and carry out what's called an affinity

1630
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:36,400
maturation so they start to duplicate to

1631
01:15:33,639 --> 01:15:39,280
acquire mutations and the new receptors

1632
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:42,480
are selected uh to be good at binding

1633
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:45,199
the the antigen so we have like your

1634
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:47,199
this this Darian process that then will

1635
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:48,880
last for some weeks some months and we

1636
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:52,120
release in the blood memory cells and

1637
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:55,120
plasma cells so actually my focus here

1638
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:58,360
will be on memory cells

1639
01:15:55,120 --> 01:16:00,000
so which uh like is one of the main

1640
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:04,400
player for for like keeping

1641
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,920
immunological memory and uh like one one

1642
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,440
little difference that there is with

1643
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:12,040
respect to the previous case of T cells

1644
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:15,040
is that like now here uh instead of

1645
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:18,000
considering my set of clones basically

1646
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:20,120
my basic unit contains all the memory

1647
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,280
cells that comes from the same Affinity

1648
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:24,920
maturation process so basically with the

1649
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:27,360
idea that like each Affinity mat

1650
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:30,040
duration is like responding against a a

1651
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:32,120
given pathogen and so all the memory

1652
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:34,400
cells that comes from that process will

1653
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:36,880
like somehow be in common and will be

1654
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,400
reacting against a given pathogen so

1655
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,960
here is exactly the same from the

1656
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:43,080
mathematical point of view like it's a

1657
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:45,679
set of numbers but now my numbers is the

1658
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:48,719
number of cells coming from the same uh

1659
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:51,600
lineage from the same Affinity

1660
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:54,040
maturation and then therefore I can like

1661
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,400
perform the inference as before and I

1662
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:59,000
can get numbers as before

1663
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:01,320
and I mean surprisingly enough basically

1664
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,080
I get very similar numbers as before so

1665
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:06,880
I find that like memory cells

1666
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:09,800
lineages can last can have like this

1667
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:12,840
time scale of decay of 16 years for one

1668
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:15,400
patient and 13 years for for for the

1669
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:18,920
other patient also the the age of these

1670
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:21,400
two patients is quite uh old I I think

1671
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:25,040
one was 70 years old the other one was

1672
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:26,520
55 so again this like it's very very uh

1673
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:29,960
in agreement with same with the same

1674
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:31,679
result of T cells was not really um

1675
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,040
expected from the beginning but somehow

1676
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:35,920
we found similar

1677
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:37,679
number I have a I have a quick uh yes

1678
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,480
question about that um have you done

1679
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:42,920
experiments to see if these estimates

1680
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:44,440
are stable to sequence in depth because

1681
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:46,000
i' I'd be quite interested because you

1682
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,719
know you have the power law so I don't

1683
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,760
really know how that yeah okay I mean in

1684
01:17:47,719 --> 01:17:53,520
in principle in principle all the all

1685
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,440
the kind of framework includes the

1686
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,840
sequencing death in the

1687
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:59,760
in the picture so it shouldn't be

1688
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,800
independent at all from for for the

1689
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,320
sequence in that I'm pretty sure that

1690
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:06,239
like in the case of Mariam for example

1691
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:11,400
in this other case of thes

1692
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:13,880
cels um I guess like uh each kind of

1693
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:17,080
point so you can see for example you

1694
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:19,600
have patient four that is like yellow

1695
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:22,840
and you can see different points and

1696
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,360
each point is a different pair so you

1697
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:26,600
have multiple time points and you

1698
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:29,159
perform the inference between every pair

1699
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:31,000
of time points and therefore every

1700
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:33,480
experiment will have also different

1701
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,120
sequence in depth and the fact that you

1702
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:37,800
obtain similar values like should Point

1703
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,880
towards the direction that this kind of

1704
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,440
procedure shouldn't depend on the

1705
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,440
sequencing

1706
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:47,320
dep I don't know if I answer your

1707
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:49,199
question or yeah I I think I think I

1708
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:50,880
think so but I guess there's also the

1709
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:53,719
you know even with the same pair of

1710
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:56,679
samples if you just downsampled the ah

1711
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:58,719
okay in that sense in that sense I mean

1712
01:18:56,679 --> 01:19:00,280
I I I really think I mean I really think

1713
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:01,600
nothing changes I don't know if they

1714
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:04,600
tried in this

1715
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:06,719
work uh what what I can tell you also is

1716
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:10,560
that like those those those those

1717
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,719
numbers have have been obtained from bu

1718
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,280
reper

1719
01:19:11,719 --> 01:19:16,159
sequencing so where the sequencing that

1720
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:17,679
was like I don't know I think the the

1721
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:20,040
number of cells in an experiment is

1722
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:23,360
around 10 10 power seven something like

1723
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:26,199
that the these these numbers for B cells

1724
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:28,480
have been obtained on single cell data

1725
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:31,040
sets where the sequence in that is like

1726
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:33,000
10 power five so it's much

1727
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:36,159
smaller

1728
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,080
uh but yeah I mean I I strongly I really

1729
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:40,320
think that nothing changes just by down

1730
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:42,040
sampling I I would find exactly the same

1731
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:43,920
of course if you down sample too much

1732
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:45,440
then you start to lose signal and

1733
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:49,120
probably you will have like a larger

1734
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:51,600
error bar that you inference find but uh

1735
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:53,239
yeah Okay cool so it's pretty robust

1736
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:56,280
yeah know I'm I'm pretty sure it's quite

1737
01:19:53,239 --> 01:19:59,120
robust yeah

1738
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:59,120
okay

1739
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:05,560
um so like to wrap up this part uh so we

1740
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:07,480
have like a sort of framework that

1741
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:09,880
capture the statistics of the sepor

1742
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:12,000
abundance Dynamics in healthy condition

1743
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:15,080
and accounting for experimental

1744
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,639
sampling uh like we can try this kind of

1745
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:18,040
framework can also like answer the

1746
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:20,560
question of like about repertoire

1747
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:23,480
stability which we find to be like

1748
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:25,360
surprisingly long and potentially can

1749
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:28,440
give us like predictions of future

1750
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:30,360
experimental counts but so like to like

1751
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:34,520
point out some limitations of this kind

1752
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:37,080
of framework so as I tell told you

1753
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:39,560
before we are trusting a geometric Brum

1754
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:42,560
motion and probably this kind of model

1755
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:44,320
describes well the Dynamics only if your

1756
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:47,000
like experimental time points are

1757
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:49,080
sufficiently far away in time so if you

1758
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,719
look at the Dynamics after a few months

1759
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:54,800
probably the the model won't be able to

1760
01:20:51,719 --> 01:20:56,760
capture well the the kind of statistics

1761
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,760
and another another kind of like

1762
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:03,239
limitation can be the fact that I'm

1763
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:06,440
really treating every clone exactly with

1764
01:21:03,239 --> 01:21:08,600
the same parameters so I have a a single

1765
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:11,280
geometric brand motion that describes

1766
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:13,600
every clones in my body this is probably

1767
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,920
not really realistic so realistic so

1768
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:20,600
probably there will be like clones or

1769
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:22,520
like um groups of clones that will die

1770
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:27,239
faster group of clones that will stay

1771
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:29,760
longer uh also like to to like trying to

1772
01:21:27,239 --> 01:21:31,360
to uh match that like the kind of

1773
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,560
expectation we have I mean the kind of

1774
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,159
knowledge we have about like

1775
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,159
immunological memory we know that for

1776
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:37,880
some vaccination the immunological

1777
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:40,360
memory is very long for some other the

1778
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:42,280
immunological memory extremely shorter

1779
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:43,880
and so basically we believe that at this

1780
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:46,719
point we we are not really able to

1781
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:49,280
capture this kind of variation that we

1782
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:52,440
have across all the different uh

1783
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:52,440
lineages we have in our

1784
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:58,679
body Okay so second part is about like

1785
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,639
understanding what happens in response

1786
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:04,320
to vaccinations or

1787
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:06,760
infections uh so the kind of situation

1788
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:10,679
now is the following so you can imagine

1789
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:13,520
that when you encounter um a pathogen or

1790
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:16,159
an antigen given by some vaccination uh

1791
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:18,199
a few of your clones will start to

1792
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:20,639
expand so through this kind of

1793
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:22,960
exponential exponential

1794
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:24,960
duplication uh and at some point we'll

1795
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:26,120
start to contract coming back back to a

1796
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:29,679
given

1797
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:32,199
Baseline and the question here is trying

1798
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:34,639
really trying to understand by looking

1799
01:22:32,199 --> 01:22:37,120
at those like trajectories so

1800
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:39,400
experiments perform at multiple time

1801
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:42,400
points trying to understand which are

1802
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:44,800
those clone that expanded and again like

1803
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:47,199
the kind of difficult part to do this

1804
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:49,360
kind of task is that in experiments you

1805
01:22:47,199 --> 01:22:51,239
have like again experimental noise and

1806
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:54,120
so you would like to disentangle between

1807
01:22:51,239 --> 01:22:56,840
this the real expansions and the noise

1808
01:22:54,120 --> 01:23:00,840
that the experiment

1809
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:05,400
generates okay so like a first um a

1810
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:08,920
first approach is based on um on a uh

1811
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:11,440
previous work of Alexander TI is on a

1812
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:14,920
data set where those two people were

1813
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:17,600
like infected by covid and they

1814
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:20,520
basically collected samples of the T

1815
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:23,960
cell receptors starting from the 15th

1816
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:28,880
day after infection up to like 3 months

1817
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:28,880
after infections and there are five time

1818
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:34,639
points uh basically then for for each

1819
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:37,440
clone you can imagine that you can trace

1820
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:40,639
like a trajectory of abundances across

1821
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:43,560
these five time points so here I'm just

1822
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:45,639
plotting the the very big clones because

1823
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:48,480
you can imagine that a lot of clones

1824
01:23:45,639 --> 01:23:50,520
will be will be zero in in a few time

1825
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:53,159
points so this like the top

1826
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:54,960
clones and what you can do here like by

1827
01:23:53,159 --> 01:23:57,080
by looking at those trajectories

1828
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:00,280
is to imagine those trajectories to be

1829
01:23:57,080 --> 01:24:02,360
like vectors in a five dimensional space

1830
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:05,719
you have these five time points and you

1831
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:09,560
can try to run PCA on this space so this

1832
01:24:05,719 --> 01:24:13,000
is very a very simple uh idea but it's

1833
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:14,800
it works surprisingly well so if you do

1834
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,719
this of course I mean you you need to

1835
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,800
like do some sort of preprocessing on

1836
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:21,960
your trajectory basically you would like

1837
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,880
that all your trajectories the

1838
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:25,400
variations of all your trajectories are

1839
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:27,719
comparable so basically you have to

1840
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:29,800
rescale normalize all all your

1841
01:24:27,719 --> 01:24:32,080
trajectories and what they do in this

1842
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:35,360
work is just dividing each trajectory by

1843
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:38,199
the maximum Point such that all the

1844
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:39,199
trajectory uh is is like bounded between

1845
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:41,679
zero and

1846
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:43,000
one but like model of this kind of

1847
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:45,520
processing

1848
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,440
pre-processing uh you run PCA and you

1849
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,880
find like really different clusters

1850
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:52,520
different behaviors in the for example

1851
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:55,679
here in the two principal

1852
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:57,239
components and then if you like plot the

1853
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,320
kind of average behavior of the

1854
01:24:57,239 --> 01:25:02,119
trajectory in the different clusters you

1855
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:05,320
really observe like different Trends so

1856
01:25:02,119 --> 01:25:08,280
in the the the Violet ones will be the

1857
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:10,000
constant trajectories so you probably

1858
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:12,719
trajectories that are that are not

1859
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,679
carrying at told of the presence of

1860
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:19,000
covid then you will have like these

1861
01:25:14,679 --> 01:25:20,639
green ones so and after day 15 basically

1862
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,440
you you're observing that they start

1863
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:24,920
from a big count and they

1864
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:27,679
Decay so they are Contracting ing so

1865
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:30,199
therefore it's very likely that they

1866
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:32,360
responded to the disease and now they

1867
01:25:30,199 --> 01:25:34,639
are just Contracting and returning to

1868
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:37,440
the Baseline and then also You observe

1869
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:41,719
like a third cluster that somehow it

1870
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:45,040
seems to um correspond to a secondary

1871
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:48,840
response uh but I mean then in in this

1872
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:52,280
paper they really went more into details

1873
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:54,639
and try to like um verify that the

1874
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:56,679
Clones they observe in this yellow and

1875
01:25:54,639 --> 01:26:00,000
green cluster are effectively clones

1876
01:25:56,679 --> 01:26:03,280
that are able to to bind Co and it seems

1877
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,719
so but like I would like just point out

1878
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:06,840
to the fact that the method is very

1879
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:08,760
simple and is able to like capture some

1880
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:11,600
kind of statistics and isolate different

1881
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,600
behaviors of your

1882
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:20,199
trajectories also this um this is saying

1883
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:23,719
that uh it's also capturing the fact

1884
01:26:20,199 --> 01:26:26,000
that like as people believe like T cell

1885
01:26:23,719 --> 01:26:28,239
clones typically they have like an

1886
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,320
expansion time scale of like couple of

1887
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:33,159
weeks and so if you look at the Green

1888
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:35,119
Clones probably those are the really the

1889
01:26:33,159 --> 01:26:37,560
Clones that expanded at the maximum

1890
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:38,719
point at after one two weeks and now

1891
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:41,480
they are

1892
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:44,800
decaying but okay this like was was like

1893
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:47,560
a first approach but actually the if you

1894
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:50,199
want this kind of approach is not really

1895
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:52,199
is not really possible to being used

1896
01:26:50,199 --> 01:26:54,440
like in a systematic way because there

1897
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:57,320
are like different choices that that you

1898
01:26:54,440 --> 01:27:00,159
can do uh a priority that are not very

1899
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:01,800
well established I mean you you can take

1900
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:04,840
different choices and obtain different

1901
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:06,480
results I mean one one choice is the

1902
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:09,360
fact that I have to normalize

1903
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:11,760
trajectories is not there there are many

1904
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:14,320
choices of doing this I can consider

1905
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:16,639
counts or log counts but probably the

1906
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:20,000
the biggest problem is that here I'm not

1907
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:22,440
really taking into account uh in a

1908
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:25,560
systematic way about the noise basically

1909
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:27,840
what I'm doing here so in this kind of

1910
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:31,360
example basically in this paper they

1911
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:34,320
were selecting the top 1,000 if I

1912
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:37,000
remember clones in the data set and

1913
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:40,159
Performing the analysis on this top most

1914
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,960
abundant abundant 1,000 clones if you

1915
01:27:40,159 --> 01:27:45,600
repeat the analysis by choosing like the

1916
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:47,440
top 10,000 clone uh you stop to see any

1917
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:50,440
signal because then at some point your

1918
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:52,080
signal is dominated by noise so there is

1919
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:55,040
not really like

1920
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:58,320
a a threshold a number

1921
01:27:55,040 --> 01:28:00,920
that's uh uh that's valid for every

1922
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:02,840
experiment that tells you to choose like

1923
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:04,880
a given number of top clones to perform

1924
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:07,520
your experiment so it's it doesn't

1925
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:10,520
really quantitatively take care about

1926
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:14,400
the the the experimental nodes so like

1927
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:18,040
to include a more

1928
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:21,040
um a more quantitative approach to like

1929
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:23,560
uh model response in presence of

1930
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:25,760
experimental noise we can use like an an

1931
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:28,159
approach similar to the one we used

1932
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:30,000
before so this was exactly the same

1933
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:33,480
picture I show before for the geometric

1934
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,600
Brum motion instead now of course as I

1935
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:38,360
told you genetic brand and motion was

1936
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:41,440
working well in healthy conditions for

1937
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:44,000
very well separated time points here I'm

1938
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:47,480
want to change my my model my dynamical

1939
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,800
model by including something that models

1940
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:51,639
this kind of expansions or contractions

1941
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:56,800
that I'm observing in my

1942
01:28:51,639 --> 01:29:00,400
clones okay so let's try to look at this

1943
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:03,159
model uh so uh this model is is the

1944
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:06,920
following is it's quite simple so

1945
01:29:03,159 --> 01:29:09,440
basically it's um I I'm I'm doing this

1946
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:12,440
kind of introducing this new variable

1947
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:14,080
this s that is the log fold change so

1948
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:16,239
basically the logarithm of the ratio

1949
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:19,560
between the counts at time two and the

1950
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:23,199
counts at time one and I can express of

1951
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:26,280
course N2 as a function of this s and my

1952
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:28,119
my my probability is depends on this s

1953
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:31,239
so we will have like two

1954
01:29:28,119 --> 01:29:34,239
terms let's let's first focus on the

1955
01:29:31,239 --> 01:29:37,320
terms on the right so basically you have

1956
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:39,320
this F that's the fraction of clones

1957
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:41,480
that you are believing are expanding so

1958
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:43,920
they are reacting to the to the disease

1959
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:47,920
to the vaccination and are

1960
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:50,239
expanding and this F multiplies this raw

1961
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:53,360
which is a probability distribution over

1962
01:29:50,239 --> 01:29:56,520
the lock fold changes so it's a sort of

1963
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:59,119
if you want prior on what would be the

1964
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:02,719
distribution of L log fold changes that

1965
01:29:59,119 --> 01:30:05,639
your your data set will have uh actually

1966
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:07,920
uh the kind of results of the inference

1967
01:30:05,639 --> 01:30:09,600
don't depend too much by the specific

1968
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,719
choice of this

1969
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,159
distribution um and then you you will

1970
01:30:11,719 --> 01:30:15,480
have a second term that's with

1971
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:19,119
probability one of one minus F so the

1972
01:30:15,480 --> 01:30:21,000
fraction one minus F of your clones will

1973
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:23,800
not expand will not

1974
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,800
contract and basically will keep their

1975
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:28,960
uh lock F

1976
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:32,360
change equal to this s0 so this is a

1977
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:34,159
Delta function and this s0 is a number

1978
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:37,159
that's very close to zero but it's not

1979
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:40,800
exactly zero because basically I I I

1980
01:30:37,159 --> 01:30:42,719
need to like conserve the total number

1981
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:45,199
total number of cells in the body so if

1982
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:47,520
some of the cells are expanding all the

1983
01:30:45,199 --> 01:30:51,480
others they have to contract a little

1984
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:54,600
bit um so that's the model so I I will

1985
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:57,000
have like one a couple of new parameter

1986
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:59,920
F and S zero and typically I have like

1987
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,840
one parameter more in my distribution of

1988
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:05,000
lock fold

1989
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:07,520
changes but the idea now is like exactly

1990
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,040
to do as before so I can write down

1991
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:11,760
probabilities of of observing

1992
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:14,400
experimental counts uh writing a

1993
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:17,000
likelihood and trying to maximize the

1994
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:20,639
likelihood okay so I I can do this I can

1995
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,880
obtain like the best parameters uh given

1996
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:25,080
my

1997
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:27,040
experiment and what is actually

1998
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:31,040
interesting the way this kind of

1999
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:32,920
framework can be used to like identify

2000
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:34,400
expanding clone is the following so I

2001
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:37,280
can compute a

2002
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:40,360
posterior it's basically a probability

2003
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:43,199
of observing a given expansion size

2004
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:44,800
given some experimental counts and this

2005
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:47,360
kind of posteriors can be easily

2006
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,040
computed given the probability I showed

2007
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:50,400
you

2008
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:54,040
before and there and then at the end I

2009
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:56,520
can use this posterior as a as a sort of

2010
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:59,199
statistical tests to identify expanding

2011
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:03,159
clones so basically I can compute what's

2012
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:05,760
the probability of a clone not to expand

2013
01:32:03,159 --> 01:32:09,000
so of having a Lo F change smaller or

2014
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:11,119
equal to zero given some experimental

2015
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,000
counts and if this probability is

2016
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:17,159
smaller than a given sort of statistical

2017
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,159
confidence Alpha I can say that those

2018
01:32:17,159 --> 01:32:22,199
those those clones with those

2019
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:24,760
experimental counts will like are likely

2020
01:32:22,199 --> 01:32:26,760
expanding and so I can select them and

2021
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:29,199
they can be like candidates for like

2022
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:29,199
future

2023
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:36,080
investigations and so like as um just

2024
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:39,480
like to to visualize visualize a little

2025
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:42,600
bit what happens if you plot in a in

2026
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:45,080
this like kind of uh diagram the counts

2027
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:47,360
at time one and the counts at time two

2028
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:49,560
this kind of condition with this

2029
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:51,960
confidence Alpha basically we it will

2030
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:54,119
trace a line on this plot and all the

2031
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:56,159
points above this line so with a large

2032
01:32:54,119 --> 01:32:58,760
with a with a count of time to that's

2033
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:59,880
much larger what would I expect if there

2034
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:02,480
are no

2035
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:05,480
expansion is set basically this gives me

2036
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:08,679
all the Clones that are probably

2037
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:12,159
expanded and uh so this kind of

2038
01:33:08,679 --> 01:33:15,719
procedure as has been discussed in in in

2039
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:18,960
a paper of Alexan and also uh has been

2040
01:33:15,719 --> 01:33:21,280
like translated in in a software so

2041
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:25,280
there is this open source software that

2042
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:29,440
is able to perform this kind of by Asian

2043
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:33,800
U analysis to identify expanding or

2044
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:33,800
Contracting loans in in in

2045
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:40,080
data and uh and so like to conclude this

2046
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:41,920
part uh I told you that we have like

2047
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:43,440
this framework that is able to

2048
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:46,000
disentangle between the experimental

2049
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:48,920
noise and resp and to identify like

2050
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:51,560
responding clones it's a ban framework

2051
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:55,159
so in principle there is also room to

2052
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:58,159
play with the prior on the Lo changes

2053
01:33:55,159 --> 01:34:00,159
distribution um and starting from like

2054
01:33:58,159 --> 01:34:02,560
this this framework there is also a

2055
01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:05,560
software that can be downloaded and in

2056
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:07,560
principle is like easy to use and can be

2057
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:09,920
used on on real

2058
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:13,000
analysis uh

2059
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:15,239
again I would like to mention a

2060
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:18,280
limitation which is which is the fact

2061
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:20,199
that actually as I told you before uh

2062
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:22,960
again I have a noise model entering in

2063
01:34:20,199 --> 01:34:24,880
my likelihood so I need to like learn

2064
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:26,639
the noise model before but to learn the

2065
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:28,600
noise model I need experimental

2066
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:31,119
replicates so basically the main

2067
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:34,520
limitation of using this kind of tools

2068
01:34:31,119 --> 01:34:36,560
is that I need two time points and two

2069
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:38,080
experimental replicates to perform first

2070
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:41,400
the inference of the noise and then the

2071
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:44,199
inference of the of the expansion but

2072
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:46,000
then if those are there basically all

2073
01:34:44,199 --> 01:34:48,600
these kind of framework should should

2074
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,880
reliably take into account about uh all

2075
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:52,679
the kind of problems that can be in the

2076
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:55,119
the in the errors in the experimental

2077
01:34:52,679 --> 01:34:57,480
counts

2078
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:59,679
Andre before you go to that part um just

2079
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:03,040
a really simple question like how does

2080
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:05,560
the invasion approach compared to like

2081
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:08,040
the naive approach that most people use

2082
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:11,520
which is just looking at clone

2083
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:13,360
frequencies at time Point T1 and T2 and

2084
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:15,440
if it goes up over a certain amount like

2085
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:17,440
how many can you just say something like

2086
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:20,719
I maybe I missed it but like like can

2087
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:22,320
you just say what you think the false

2088
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:25,000
positive and false negatives we're

2089
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:27,719
getting when we just do a very yeah I

2090
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,679
think I think by by learn by Better

2091
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:30,520
Learning what's the kind of noise you

2092
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:34,080
would

2093
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:36,360
expect basically your model would like

2094
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:38,840
change a little bit the threshold so it

2095
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:41,760
it would shift a little bit this

2096
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:44,199
line so you can say Okay I want to to

2097
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:46,880
choose with confidence 1% the the

2098
01:35:44,199 --> 01:35:49,280
Contracting Clans if you would use like

2099
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:52,480
a standard model that doesn't account

2100
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:53,800
properly um of the experimental errors

2101
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:56,480
you would always choose the same

2102
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:58,280
threshold this kind of approach we would

2103
01:35:56,480 --> 01:36:00,320
move the threshold depending on the

2104
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:02,480
intensity of the noise that it finds

2105
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:05,040
somehow

2106
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:08,679
so in in an experiment with a lot of

2107
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:11,360
noise it will choose less points and

2108
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:14,159
probably that that's the right way to do

2109
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:17,920
because you are less confident because

2110
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:17,920
that the noise is stronger
