how to confidently navigate and level

9
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,679
the potential of AI and he will provide

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,680
a clear executive level overview to help

11
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:37,960
you make informed uh

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:41,719
decisions the talk talk title is making

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:46,440
business sense of AI key questions for

14
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,440
leaders please join me in welcoming

15
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:52,960
George thanks

16
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,640
y so yeah You' be getting Ai and all day

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,039
and yesterday and again today so what

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,640
could I have to say about it what I have

19
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,840
to say about it is that it's complicated

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,080
and I'm going to try to help you make it

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,680
a little less complicated if that helps

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,119
I should also say I teach in the

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,400
management school not in the engineering

24
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,960
school so what I'm going to tell you is

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,520
aiming to be 100% clear and 95% correct

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,840
not the other way around okay uh that's

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,439
why you have you know if you're a

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,479
technical person you'll understand why

29
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,360
I'm doing this and if you're a

30
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,799
non-technical person you can talk to

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,000
your technical folks and get the other

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,119
5% okay okay uh of course it'll take 3

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,759
hours to get the other 5% so listen AI

34
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,200
is getting a lot of attention we know

35
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:40,439
that here's the you know the standard

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:42,240
Google Trends chart and you can see you

37
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,880
know the the red line of AI lots of

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,880
attention that blue line starting to

39
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,360
sneak up here's the other thing though

40
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,920
sorry the colors changed but that red

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,360
line now the Blue Line see how flat it

42
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,960
is that red line is chat GPT so is this

43
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,439
attention is it hype it's hard to know

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,280
and you know in this world of generative

45
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,280
AI we're almost 2 years in into the

46
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,799
launch the first launch of cat

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,360
GPT how many people have used cat GPT

48
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,920
CLA something like that okay if you are

49
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,879
not raising your hand raise your hand

50
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,400
next time use it the only way to make

51
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,840
sense out of this stuff is to use it and

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,480
play with it you're not going to hurt

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,720
yourself right but you will hurt

54
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,760
yourself by not having played with it

55
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,120
because it's the kind of thing you

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,599
explore and you get to know a little bit

57
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,480
better what it's good at what it's not

58
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,160
good at and you can choose your model

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,040
right there are a bunch of things out

60
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,360
there but it's a different paradigm

61
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,200
worth paying attention to okay and just

62
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,040
to give you an idea what generative I AI

63
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,440
can do in business uh we no longer shoot

64
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,519
videos for our training courses we just

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,400
give a script to an AI and it comput it

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,920
creates the video for us uh in whatever

67
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,400
face you want and whatever language you

68
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,879
want and if you want to get really

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,640
fancy I can give it a video of a very

70
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,239
convincing video of me talking when I've

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,640
never done that you know deep fakes for

72
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,440
the use of for good rather than e evil

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,959
um so you know if I want to learn how to

74
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,159
speak Vietnamese I just push a button

75
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,280
and I'm speaking Vietnamese and

76
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,040
evidently it's pretty good at it okay uh

77
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,159
coding many people doing interesting

78
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,959
things with coding and you know this is

79
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,799
this is taking off we don't know how far

80
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,319
it's going to go but it's making a big

81
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,040
difference right now uh Cresta is

82
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,760
helping in call

83
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,720
centers they uh the idea of using this

84
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,480
is it becomes a coach it listens while

85
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,319
you're talking and gives you nudges and

86
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,000
after the fact it can also from what I

87
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,640
understand come and say you know across

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,120
those last 10 calls you had this

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,680
tendency you might want to try to fix it

90
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,080
the same way if you had a really amazing

91
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,200
coach everybody gets better using a tool

92
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,760
like this and the new people get wildly

93
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,239
better right so they raise the bar to

94
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,000
here and of course the new people and if

95
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,560
this is Cresta there are many others in

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,439
there they have these for legal now they

97
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,200
have these for Consultants they have

98
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,159
things other there's another very nice

99
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,280
randomized study in a a consulting firm

100
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,319
that they're using G uh they're using

101
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,239
these tools

102
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,720
to

103
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:07,239
solve strategy Consulting problems and

104
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,599
it's really pretty good at it so um you

105
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,079
you want to you want to be careful there

106
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,720
are limits where it's the wrong tool to

107
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,360
use and then if you haven't seen what's

108
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,199
being embedded in the tools you already

109
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,359
use some really fancy stuff uh Adobe has

110
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,880
the entire marketing chain now where you

111
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,880
can customize uh you can create new art

112
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,960
you can customize and uh every message

113
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,639
you send out all this kind of thing it's

114
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,680
being embedded in the tools you use okay

115
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,840
so you know we're seeing things like

116
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:39,440
this AI writes 98% of our policies 98%

117
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,160
of our first claim notices and handles

118
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,240
50% of claims instantly and it's getting

119
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,600
better and better this is lemonade they

120
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,400
do kind of simple Insurance products but

121
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,680
you know how disruptive technology works

122
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,919
right you start by fixing the taking

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,360
care of the simple ones and then you

124
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:57,320
move up market and they're doing that

125
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,560
here now the really important thing here

126
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,680
also is this is not just generative AI

127
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,440
it's other kinds of AI and analytics

128
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,720
processing also put together to solve

129
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,759
the right problems in the right way and

130
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,800
that's really an important

131
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,520
point then if you you know if you think

132
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,759
Beyond information business there's you

133
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,560
know Cisco they basically are the the

134
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,720
global supply chain for every restaurant

135
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,560
in the world and uh you know they're

136
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,720
shipping hot things cold things

137
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,000
different

138
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,199
different delivery speeds all kinds of

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,199
things to make this work for the

140
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,199
restaurants around the world they have

141
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,560
one of the world's largest truck fleets

142
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,080
I learned uh just sending the you know

143
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,319
getting things around to the the

144
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,479
restaurants that need them each of these

145
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,120
is a use of where they're using AI in

146
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,360
their supply chain or in their customer

147
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,000
support and the little weird little

148
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,759
circuit board things with the brain in

149
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,520
the middle that's where they're starting

150
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,199
to investigate generative AI in here but

151
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,840
once again they're not solving whole

152
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,720
problems with generative AI they're

153
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,280
solving parts of problems and they're

154
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,360
linking it to other Technologies to

155
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,720
solve other parts of problems and

156
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,520
and so as you think about it you might

157
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,240
want to think about it the same way in

158
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,039
what you are doing so we're seeing it in

159
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,039
a purely information-based business like

160
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,479
Insurance we're seeing it in marking

161
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,120
very information based and you see it in

162
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,880
a very hard Goods product like this the

163
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,520
AI is being used and generative AI is

164
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,880
being used in many ways okay so what I

165
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,440
want to do is I want to share four

166
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,840
categories of

167
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,840
ai ai Advanced analytics first of all is

168
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,960
generative AI you know I mentioned that

169
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,639
we'll talk about it in more detail uh

170
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,479
but there's three others right

171
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,280
and these are all advanced analytics and

172
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,800
you can argue that they're all versions

173
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,639
of artificial intelligence some are just

174
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,000
a little bit more intelligent than

175
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,360
others right but they're all useful in

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,039
many different ways but when you're

177
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,680
thinking about using these tools what

178
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,560
you really want to start with is not the

179
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,599
technology but the problem it's very

180
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,800
easy and I'm seeing it happen in many

181
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:01,840
many companies where they're saying go

182
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,160
out and find a a way to use generative

183
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Ai and you know the slogan right if you

184
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,240
are a hammer everything looks like a

185
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,680
nail and that's what's happening is

186
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,440
they're there're they're hammering

187
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,240
generative AI in where it doesn't really

188
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,160
belong now sometimes they're finding

189
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,800
where it does belong too uh but you can

190
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,440
have a lot of cost and a lot of risk if

191
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,000
you use it in the wrong way I am not

192
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,199
saying don't use it I'm saying use the

193
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,319
right tool for the right job right I'm

194
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,680
renovating a house right now I'm

195
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,199
learning all about the right tool for

196
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,720
the right job I'm also learning that

197
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,240
when you're renovate a house it's a

198
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,240
great chance to spend a lot of money on

199
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,479
Cool Tools right uh but hopefully I'm

200
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,680
I'm buying the right tools for the job

201
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,879
so just for two examples at Airbus when

202
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,800
they were trying to fix some problems in

203
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,319
their

204
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,360
manufacturing uh Matt Evans was in

205
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:49,840
charge of that process he says listen

206
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,080
strictly speaking we don't invest in AI

207
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,440
or natural language processing or image

208
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,120
analytics we're always investing in a

209
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,039
business problem and what they were

210
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,840
doing is they were trying to to detect

211
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:02,000
when problems were happening they were

212
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,919
trying to sense what was causing those

213
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,919
symptoms and they were finding ways then

214
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,639
to distribute that information across

215
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,080
shifts and across managers so once they

216
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,639
solve the problem it didn't happen again

217
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,120
okay another example is Home Depot where

218
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,280
I'm spending a lot of time right now

219
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,639
right and they are saying we should

220
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,080
always be looking for Extraordinary

221
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:26,000
experiences experience that Delights the

222
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,560
technology we use that's underneath its

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,879
secondary so the first question you can

224
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,320
ask if somebody goes out and says hey

225
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,919
I'm going to I want to find a generative

226
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,320
AI problem or a deep learning problem is

227
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,519
what problem you trying to

228
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,080
solve then you can go from there okay

229
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,880
and each of these a the experience that

230
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,399
Delights that's a lot of problems to

231
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,279
solve it's a lot of tasks and they'll be

232
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,920
solved in different ways okay so then

233
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,200
you choose the AI approach you want so

234
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,640
what I'd like to do is walk you through

235
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,120
all four and give you a a

236
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,800
non-technical understanding of what

237
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,440
these are just so you can speak the

238
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,200
language okay rule base systems when I

239
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,880
started working as an engineer in the

240
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,680
80s one of my first jobs was to build a

241
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,320
rule-based system engine rule based

242
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,600
engine for where I was working and you

243
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,320
know what you got is basically if this

244
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,800
then that okay and then you put a lot of

245
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,760
those together and you can kind of

246
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,959
constrain what the answer should be you

247
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,519
put a lot of them together also you get

248
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:24,040
a lot of conflicting rules but rules

249
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,079
engines have gotten really good and I

250
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,760
would argue that every one of you has

251
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:29,920
some kind of a rule engine in your

252
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,640
company already whether it's Finance

253
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,399
rules purchasing rules uh medical

254
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,800
prescription rules all these kinds of

255
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,959
things where it can take information in

256
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,760
and just kind of classify good or bad

257
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,200
from some of these things every time you

258
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,360
go to the pharmacy and it says don't

259
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,959
take this with that there's a rule-based

260
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,680
engine helping with that okay so these

261
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,640
have been around forever they are very

262
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,399
very precise in their answers but

263
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,760
program them requires programming it

264
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,760
requires

265
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,360
a set of experts who can tell you if

266
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,040
this then

267
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,680
that and it can't do anything else it's

268
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,920
pretty R rigid right uh next up

269
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,839
econometrics we've all many of you learn

270
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,920
statistics in class whether you enjoy

271
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,519
that or not uh and those of us who have

272
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,440
come to enjoy really love statistics in

273
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,079
econometrics they can do really amazing

274
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,360
things but really what they're doing is

275
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,720
you're classifying right how do we get

276
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,440
the the data point the the the data

277
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,440
elements that will distinguish The Blues

278
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,760
from the greens on there or you're

279
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,399
trying to find trend lines and now you

280
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,959
can do causality and some other things

281
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,639
in special cases um but you know while

282
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,399
it's easy to draw those lines as you get

283
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,720
into multiple Dimensions it gets a lot

284
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,839
harder no problem at all for the

285
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,880
computer right and of course it doesn't

286
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,240
even have to be linear you can fit

287
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,440
curves that look like this okay so those

288
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,120
of you who have done this you know what

289
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,680
I'm talking about those of you have not

290
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,399
done it just believe me it works and the

291
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,079
thing about it is it's not that hard

292
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:58,839
unless you're doing the really fancy

293
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,440
stuff it's not that hard it doesn't take

294
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,480
that much data it doesn't take that much

295
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,880
processing power you just need somebody

296
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,120
who knows how to do it without getting

297
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,200
without creating problems okay then we

298
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,399
got deep learning now this gets a little

299
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,800
trickier deep learning is a new a

300
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,000
different way of thinking about it in

301
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,200
regressions and and and econometrics

302
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,240
you're basically fitting you know here's

303
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,480
three or four inputs and we're going to

304
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,040
do weighted averages of those inputs to

305
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,800
try to predict an output of some kind

306
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,320
very simple that's basically what you're

307
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,519
doing now coming up with what those

308
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,720
weights are is the tricky part in deep

309
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,279
learning it's the same thing but you

310
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,920
don't just need numbers you can do it on

311
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,800
images you can do it on text you can do

312
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,240
it on voice you can do it on lots of

313
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,920
different things and the scary picture

314
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,000
that the experts will show you is that

315
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,680
picture in the middle see it the green

316
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,360
and the green and the green picture if

317
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,560
anybody wants to impress you with how

318
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,279
smart they are they'll show you that

319
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,800
picture if anybody wants to make you

320
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,600
convinced their that you're not smart

321
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,279
enough they'll show you that picture

322
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,000
okay that picture is the same thing as

323
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:03,760
what was happening before but just amped

324
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,240
Up by many orders of magnitude right you

325
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,639
take a bunch of

326
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,480
inputs you take a weighted average of

327
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,800
them on this first here let see if I

328
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,720
okay and then those things you do a

329
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,120
weighted average of those and a weighted

330
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,839
average of boom boom and then you get

331
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,760
outputs okay and once again the hard

332
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,760
part is coming up with the weights but

333
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,440
where on the expert systems you had to

334
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,360
have an expert say what's happening in

335
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,320
statistics you don't statistics figure

336
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,959
out what those weights are and the same

337
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,600
thing happens here just in a much more

338
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,959
complicated way now the other thing is

339
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,720
when you're looking at conom metrics you

340
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,040
can read those you know we got 10

341
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,040
parameters and those weights this one is

342
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,040
more important than this one and this is

343
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,480
negative compared to that one don't even

344
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,800
try with machine learning uh our best

345
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,279
scientists are trying to make these

346
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,440
things explainable and they're making a

347
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,920
little bit of progress but you just have

348
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,320
to believe it it's just magic okay so

349
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,360
let me show you what the magic is is uh

350
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,399
first of all what you do is you

351
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,160
iteratively develop a formula by running

352
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,519
things through you do many many many

353
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,720
iterations thousands millions of

354
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,000
iterations and um eventually by figuring

355
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,440
out where it's wrong and where it's

356
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,320
right and adjusting it comes up with

357
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,560
pretty good answers so if you think if

358
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,320
you want to think about this think about

359
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,440
it like you know the pachinko machines

360
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,040
where you drop a ball in and you hope it

361
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,199
comes out in the right slot at the

362
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,880
bottom and if it comes out in the right

363
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:30,720
wrong slot you just adjust you could

364
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,079
adjust adjust all those little things

365
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,000
and hope it moves a little differently

366
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,560
that's basically what it's doing imagine

367
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,800
doing a million of those and adjusting

368
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,720
these little things all the way down

369
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:45,199
okay um you need data you need

370
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,959
truth every time you log in and it says

371
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,680
proed you're a human tell me where the

372
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,759
stop signs are in this

373
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,680
picture you're creating labeled data for

374
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,360
some algorithm to use every time

375
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Facebook does its or sorry I showed

376
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,519
myself to be old Instagram does its uh

377
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,120
brothers and sisters challenge or the

378
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,399
young versus old me challenge we're

379
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,720
creating labeled data to train

380
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,079
algorithms okay um you need that labeled

381
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,639
data you need to know what the right

382
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:16,440
answer is so you can train the

383
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,519
algorithms to get there now and then by

384
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,480
running through many times you adjust

385
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,920
the little Pinko knobs and then

386
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,480
eventually you come up with the right

387
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,759
answer uh the answers tend to be get the

388
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,160
same answer every time for a given input

389
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,639
um but you can't explain you just just

390
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,079
believe it it just works okay uh the

391
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,199
good thing is it can adapt over time I'm

392
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,639
going to walk you through a little bit

393
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,079
more detail on this one just so you

394
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,279
don't have to be scared by that silly

395
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,920
picture anymore okay um what's what what

396
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:47,959
are these they're numbers right we know

397
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:50,399
the numbers imagine writing a bunch of

398
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:54,759
if then statements to figure out whether

399
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,519
that whole row is twos okay so look here

400
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,360
uh two has a loop in it right well it

401
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,959
does but that doesn't have a loop right

402
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,680
and a two tends to have a little curve

403
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,480
at the top and end a loop but there's no

404
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,160
real curve there right

405
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,120
um IM writing the statements for a two

406
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,000
or how about sevens

407
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,959
right do you allow for the little line

408
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,120
or not and you know how curvy can it be

409
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,199
look at that eight those Loops are

410
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,720
filled in but we still know it's an

411
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,560
eight but I've written this code it's

412
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,160
about 25 30 lines of code and about

413
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,079
20,000 iterations on data and it works

414
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,160
totally fine how here's how it works

415
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:36,839
right you start off by taking an image

416
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:39,000
and unrolling it into a line of bits

417
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,440
okay a line a line of line of data a

418
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,240
line of line of bytes and so what

419
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,240
happens is you lose all the idea of

420
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,199
what's next to what you just have 28x 28

421
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,079
becomes a line a vector of data okay and

422
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:56,000
you use that as input to

423
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:58,399
a waiting thing then you put a piece you

424
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,480
put in a picture that nine and it's and

425
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,759
using just you start with random numbers

426
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,040
put it in and it makes a guess which of

427
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:08,639
the follow which of the digits is it

428
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:13,199
okay and it guesses that's a one well

429
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:15,920
that's wrong okay then you back chain

430
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,519
the data and adjust some things

431
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,600
depending how wrong it was then you put

432
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,079
number other numbers through and other

433
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,319
numbers through and eventually it gets

434
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:25,480
to the point where it's pretty darn

435
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:28,000
right okay you put the all the pixels in

436
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,720
the left hand side you get likelihood

437
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,720
that it's each number on the right hand

438
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,199
side and iterating over and over again

439
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,160
it learns what's right okay so now you

440
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:40,360
don't need to be scared by that that uh

441
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,880
picture anymore that's all that's

442
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,720
happening it's statistics on steroids

443
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,240
okay um then the generative AI what is

444
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,839
generative AI it does the next step of

445
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,560
this it takes those same kinds of ideas

446
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,199
but in in addition

447
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,519
to

448
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,360
classifying it starts creating so once

449
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,079
again I am way oversimplifying this

450
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,919
but to give you an idea what happens

451
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:07,520
here it'll randomly generate if I say

452
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,760
you know uh how what what should I say

453
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:14,039
in a talk about AI for non-technical

454
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,439
people it takes that statement plus

455
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,640
everything it knows and it creates a

456
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,959
couple words okay and it creates

457
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,559
thousands of those types of words and it

458
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,480
says which one best fits with what

459
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,360
George just said and what we know

460
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,760
before let say to that one and then it

461
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,640
takes another couple words and it says

462
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,160
what best fits with what I just chose

463
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,559
plus what George said plus what we know

464
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,480
before and it just piles on more and

465
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,080
more words and it's fancier than that

466
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,760
but that's basically it it's randomly

467
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,520
generating stuff and choosing the best

468
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,919
it can out of what it just randomly

469
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,039
generated and through magic meaning

470
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,760
trillions of data points that is trained

471
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:55,159
on it's pretty darn

472
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,840
good it's also you'll notice it's

473
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:00,360
sometimes

474
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:04,400
wrong uh it's you'll also notice that it

475
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,120
tends to be a little bit Bland often

476
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,360
because it's trying to do the best fit

477
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,720
not the most creative for or whatever

478
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,080
unless you tell it to be more creative

479
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,039
and then you're turning up the dial more

480
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,360
creative more wrong but basically the

481
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,679
key point is it's creating Randomness

482
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,240
and trying to choose which random

483
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,559
outcomes is

484
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,320
best and it can do it for imagery it can

485
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,039
do it for film it can do it for lots of

486
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,200
different things um it can create lots

487
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,240
of not but it can be used for evil as

488
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,280
well as good uh that year ago some

489
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:35,000
friends and I wrote an article called

490
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,360
from chat GPT to hack GPT and we said

491
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,600
man this is really good but just wait

492
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,080
till the hackers get a hold of it and of

493
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,360
course the hackers are really getting a

494
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,000
hold of it now and the fishing attempts

495
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,280
are getting really good I got a

496
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,320
voicemail from the dean a couple weeks

497
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,520
ago sounded just like her said George I

498
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,880
got to talk to

499
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,159
you it wasn't the dean and I you know I

500
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,520
kind of figured out at a certain point

501
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:56,919
that it wasn't so I played along with

502
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,559
the game and I said okay Dean what do

503
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,400
you want me to do she goes can you buy

504
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,400
some gift cards I need gift cards

505
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,799
right oh what are you going to use them

506
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,919
for so anyway uh that didn't work so

507
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,120
well uh it does tend to and you have

508
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,640
these hallucinations my favorite

509
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,799
Hallucination is this one happened about

510
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,200
a year ago a lawyer used chpt to create

511
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:20,559
his court documents and the judge was

512
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,320
not very happy because all of the C the

513
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,880
case law he cited much of it was

514
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,720
completely fake it did not exist and I

515
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,679
learned this very quickly first time i'

516
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,159
had it do a bio for me it said George is

517
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,159
the author of four award-winning

518
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:35,720
books I'm the author of three

519
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:37,960
award-winning

520
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,320
books so then I went and I said what's

521
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,360
the name of that fourth book and it gave

522
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,480
me a title which was a really good title

523
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,960
and I can't remember it so there won't

524
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:50,760
be a fourth award-winning book

525
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,200
okay uh it depends a lot on data uh it

526
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,799
there are questions you know is this

527
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,720
data going to be reused other places

528
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:56,520
you've all been through these

529
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,360
conversations there are ways to be safe

530
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,600
with this the other thing to really be

531
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,320
important about to remember importantly

532
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,960
it randomly generates so if you ask it

533
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,159
the same question twice you'll get two

534
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,679
different answers which is actually a

535
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:10,880
really interesting way to think about

536
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,280
creativity I am a pretty good writer but

537
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,400
I'm terrible at titles so I'll say okay

538
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,080
give me a good title for this give me 10

539
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,919
good titles and I'll say then take

540
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,280
number six but make it sexier it can do

541
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,799
that kind of stuff okay so I'm saying

542
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,360
what you probably already know here's

543
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,520
the thing I've just given you four

544
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,720
techniques

545
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,120
um rule engines

546
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,159
econometrics deep learning and

547
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,720
generative Ai and I said already you

548
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,000
know what is the problem you're trying

549
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,520
to solve and actually I should say what

550
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,280
part of the problem are you trying to

551
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,840
solve and here's how to think about what

552
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,280
answers might be right for you number

553
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,120
one what's the cost of being wrong if

554
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,000
you can't be wrong don't do generative

555
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,960
because generative by its nature is

556
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,440
wrong and it becomes more right but it's

557
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,520
creating new stuff for you I said that

558
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,360
wrong wrong generative AI can be right

559
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,159
but it can be also wrong the other

560
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,480
models tend to be very you know they're

561
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:08,039
going to get the answer that you've got

562
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,960
that you've trained it for uh

563
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:11,760
explainability do you need to explain if

564
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,039
so

565
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,640
regressions uh rules work the other

566
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:18,279
one's not so explainable even if you ask

567
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,039
can you explain yourself it's not really

568
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:22,840
explaining itself okay uh repeatability

569
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,640
do you need the same answers every time

570
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,840
and then the confidentiality which we

571
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,320
are finding answers to the

572
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,600
confidentiality so it's less of a

573
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,919
challenge than it was before for okay

574
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,240
the other questions you want to ask

575
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:34,159
yourself though

576
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,640
is what's your

577
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,559
data for any technique you're going

578
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:43,440
what's your source of Truth do you have

579
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,799
data that's labeled or not and also is

580
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,279
that data labeled for the type of

581
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:52,559
audience you're talking about so imagine

582
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:55,799
you know that you train something only

583
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,240
on white

584
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:01,200
men and you try to apply it to people

585
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,440
who are not white men it's very likely

586
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,919
you're going to get answers that don't

587
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,840
quite fit but we do that all the time

588
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:13,799
right um one of the most famous examples

589
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:17,919
is um at Amazon their resumé scanning

590
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:20,039
algorithm was programmed on their best

591
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,480
engineers and so basically it rejected

592
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:24,120
all the women because they didn't have

593
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,960
very many women Engineers right and they

594
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,919
found it out they had to fix it but they

595
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:31,039
had biased data and it was causing

596
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,159
biased outputs that you had to fix and

597
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,679
they owned up to it and they told

598
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,559
everybody about it and we've all learned

599
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,640
from that process okay so the formatic

600
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,000
major categories then up this chart in

601
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,919
this chart you can see you know you

602
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,240
don't need a lot of data but you do need

603
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:47,520
experts it it's repeatable and

604
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,760
explainable but it really can't ex it

605
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,679
can't it's rigid right and over there

606
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,840
right uh you need a whole lot of data

607
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:57,360
doesn't have to be numbers it's

608
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,000
repeatable but it's not explainable so

609
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,240
if this helps you as you think about

610
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,240
what you're doing

611
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:06,600
okay so hopefully that has helped you

612
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:08,000
understand these a little bit better

613
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,480
I've got 10 minutes left and I want to

614
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,880
give you a set of questions also to ask

615
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,760
beyond the type of algorithm using and

616
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,760
more to think about AI in general okay

617
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,279
so can I use that can I shift the topic

618
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,279
on you a little

619
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:27,520
bit you know how many people know Mo's

620
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:30,520
law all right more of you you know Mo's

621
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,080
law than used the gener of things that's

622
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,799
good and you know we can all talk about

623
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,120
Moors law this exponential growth and

624
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:37,880
how important that is and we can even

625
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,279
argue about whether Moore's Law is dead

626
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,320
uh I don't typically bet against Mo's

627
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:44,480
law but you know we can argue about that

628
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,799
I have my law westerman's law you ready

629
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,120
for

630
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:52,559
it technology changes quickly

631
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,559
organizations change much more

632
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,400
slowly so that means when you're doing

633
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,520
digital transformation digital is not

634
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,720
really the problem transformation is and

635
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,799
that means it's not really a technical

636
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,840
problem it is a technical problem but

637
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,760
it's also a leadership problem how are

638
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,080
you going to change the organization to

639
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,360
go with

640
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,200
this and we forget this all the time you

641
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,679
just had a bunch of startups brilliant

642
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,600
people doing really cool stuff they're

643
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,840
not going to tell you that you got to

644
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,840
change the organization to use their

645
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,600
stuff right it's not their job to do

646
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,520
that but it's everybody's job to

647
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,480
remember when you buy those things to do

648
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,120
that right um so if we think about

649
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,080
getting the organization ready for Gen

650
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,200
AI or for AI in

651
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,679
general how are you going to decide how

652
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,360
to change the organization and what to

653
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,799
do and and here are just three simple

654
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,360
categories and of course simple

655
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:46,200
categories mean complicated answers okay

656
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,520
how are you going to prioritize what to

657
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,559
do how are you going to manage the risks

658
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,279
involved and what organizational

659
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:56,559
capabilities do you need to do so I just

660
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,559
want to share two ways from the uh that

661
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,640
so how two companies are doing it for J

662
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:05,159
and they're asking some questions around

663
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,960
governance how do we ensure safety and

664
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,919
value of these expensive projects we're

665
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,679
building right number one do you have

666
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,760
any policies in place and if not why not

667
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,960
right because people will tend to follow

668
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,640
policy in general if it's a reasonable

669
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,360
policy but if the policy doesn't exist

670
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,000
or if they don't know about it well

671
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,200
shame on you right so that's number one

672
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,279
number two are you prioritizing top down

673
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,039
to have control are you prioritizing

674
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,440
bottom up to be in Innovative and really

675
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:35,360
you know push the envelope or are some

676
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,440
hybrid of that are you technology driven

677
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,840
business driven in how you're doing this

678
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,399
how are you linking to other things

679
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,720
right these are key governance problems

680
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:46,880
dealing with any technology and those

681
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,080
governance problems apply in the AI case

682
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,880
also another set of questions you can

683
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,679
ask is how you as you're doing this how

684
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,799
are you going to learn how you going to

685
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,840
find what's happening and build upon it

686
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:58,679
how are you going to make sure that what

687
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,440
you build integrates with other things

688
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:05,480
another key set of governance questions

689
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,799
so to share how this is happening in as

690
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,919
gen came out we saw kind of a top- Down

691
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,960
centralized approach this is dangerous

692
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,520
it's costly we're going to control it

693
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,120
don't don't use this stuff or if you use

694
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,320
it wait till our it people are done and

695
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,039
then you can use it it is lower risk in

696
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,440
some way except the risk of you know you

697
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:27,720
got no agility there right but at least

698
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,880
you know some of the other problems go

699
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,760
away and you can you can control how it

700
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,240
rolls out then there's a decentralized

701
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,240
approach go have fun right just don't

702
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,840
break the company and we saw kind of

703
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,720
both of these go have fun with in policy

704
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,279
guidelines or and what we're seeing is

705
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,720
some more hybrids come out so I want to

706
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,840
give you two examples of how two large

707
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,039
companies have done this Society General

708
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,960
is a large french bank they are subject

709
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:55,320
to financial regulations they're subject

710
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,240
to European information regulations

711
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,039
they're also subject to French societal

712
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,279
standards and so there's a lot that they

713
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,120
want to be really careful about and when

714
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,039
geni came out they said you know we

715
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,360
should figure out how to use this we are

716
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,960
an information-based business but at the

717
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,080
same time there's a lot of laws that we

718
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,240
can break and so what they did is they

719
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:16,200
put out a call and they said how might

720
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,080
you use this and they got more than a

721
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,200
100 qualified use cases they actually I

722
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,640
believe got over 700 but there were 100

723
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,840
kind of common problems they were

724
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,399
looking at and then they said okay

725
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:29,000
here's the deal um out of there we see a

726
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:31,640
lot of things that you want to do

727
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
and we want to be careful about that but

728
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,320
these things we want to do there are

729
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,360
some underlying elements that are common

730
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,039
to there and you see the virtual experts

731
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,960
the content generation the client

732
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:43,559
assistance the coding let's figure out

733
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,159
how to do these really well and then

734
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:47,640
once we've got those then you can start

735
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:49,440
to do these things on your own so what

736
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,320
they did is they drisk the most common

737
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,559
elements and then they work with uh now

738
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,600
while they were doing that they also had

739
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:56,919
a few things that were just such such

740
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,960
promising things that they started doing

741
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:00,159
them right away and in talking to them

742
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,440
recently what they're doing is they're

743
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,080
still thinking about this let's do small

744
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,799
with Gen as we build up the capability

745
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,640
to do the big stuff and then we'll do

746
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,679
the big

747
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,760
stuff then there's another one back to

748
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,840
Cisco Cisco is saying this is just

749
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:18,080
another kind of AI this is actually just

750
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,039
another kind of technology and we have a

751
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,200
way that we govern technology

752
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:24,480
Investments basically we start saying

753
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,720
how do we do it in the cheapest most

754
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,480
reliable way and only go more complex

755
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,799
less reliable if we absolutely have to

756
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,320
so they go through and they they think

757
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:36,880
through where can we use this and then

758
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,799
they say well can we do our your robotic

759
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,760
process automation Bots can we do it

760
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,679
there first because that we know how to

761
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:46,480
do that uh or can we just use things

762
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,120
that built into the tools we already

763
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,360
have and only if you can't do both of

764
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,799
those then you build up your own custom

765
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,399
Solutions it's their way of managing in

766
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,679
this very complex global company how to

767
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:02,600
manage the cost cost and the the the

768
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,000
risks in making this happen so one of

769
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,720
the questions I would have for you is

770
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,320
how many of you know how your company is

771
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,320
governing

772
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:18,519
AI so the rest of you there's one really

773
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,919
wrong answer to that question about how

774
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:21,279
whether your governance is working and

775
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,640
it's if you don't know the answer it's

776
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:25,120
not

777
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,360
working okay now once you know the

778
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,279
answer you can argue about whether it's

779
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,080
the right way to do it but if you don't

780
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:32,399
know the

781
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,080
answer that's a problem now you could

782
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,320
also argue in my role I'm not required

783
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,640
to that's fine right but if you want to

784
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,720
get anything done with technology you

785
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,480
should know those rules all right so

786
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,760
those are some questions that you can

787
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,760
think about from the governance the

788
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,480
prioritization and the risk management

789
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,760
standpoint there are a couple other

790
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,120
questions as leaders that you really

791
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,080
should be ready to ask about AI in

792
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,760
general and one is

793
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,440
culture is our culture ready for

794
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,640
this so when analytics first came came

795
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,320
out there was a real question about wait

796
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,720
I've been working at this company for 40

797
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,240
years and you say that kid with a

798
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,240
computer is smarter than me did any of

799
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,840
you experience that kind of shock it's

800
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,640
happening again right and so do does

801
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,600
your culture have the humility to work

802
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,120
with these tools or is it going to

803
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,760
aggressively fight and then another

804
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,799
piece of this thing that's really that

805
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,799
has people worried is wow when that

806
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:28,519
computer gets done what job is left for

807
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,559
me right

808
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:34,159
and so one of the things to do as as as

809
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,799
a leader is think about how can you help

810
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,080
people get over these worries a little

811
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,960
bit because most of many of the

812
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,760
applications especially for genitor AI

813
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,840
we have an article on this can help you

814
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,480
do better in multiple ways they don't

815
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,760
have to replace you right they can take

816
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,039
care of the boring stuff they can make

817
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,279
you more creative and then you got to

818
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:56,440
figure out what to do with those people

819
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:58,799
that you will replace right um but in a

820
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,840
way simple from to say of course because

821
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,080
I'm not in those jobs but if you're

822
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,600
doing routine work you should stop doing

823
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,639
that anyway because eventually a

824
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,200
computer will start so as Leaders if you

825
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:09,760
have people doing routine work how can

826
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,919
you help them be ready to do something

827
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,960
else right um because as the computers

828
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:17,120
get better they will be there so the

829
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,600
ethics the humility are going to be

830
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,360
really important the other really piece

831
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,320
is this

832
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,000
experimentation these tools just like

833
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,559
many digital tools you don't you want to

834
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,399
go from Perfection to speed of

835
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:35,399
learning can we do simple learn fast

836
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,519
learn cheap fail fast fail cheap

837
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:39,840
experiments well-designed experiments to

838
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,320
learn the answer because in a Moors law

839
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,880
world it's hard to know these answers

840
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,440
and a world as complicated as the

841
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,000
digital world and and our customer

842
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,639
environments or our Global Supply Chain

843
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,960
environments it's hard to know the

844
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:54,279
answers use the data and is your culture

845
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:59,720
ready for that kind of

846
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:59,720
experimentation and then one more um

847
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,120
Talent do we have the

848
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,679
skills if we don't have the skills what

849
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,760
are we going to do about that because

850
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:11,679
those skills are hard to buy although

851
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,480
you can train them if you're willing to

852
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,519
experiment or do you just let your

853
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,679
vendors do whatever you know you use

854
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,279
whatever the vendors have but also what

855
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,639
does it mean for people's careers I

856
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,679
talked about the people doing routine

857
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:24,279
work but also everybody how can we make

858
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:25,720
everybody better so for example one

859
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:28,159
place that you'd think would be a lot of

860
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,399
replacement going on with generative AI

861
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,519
is the advertising industry and here's

862
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,799
here's a creative company denu one of

863
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,600
the biggest in the

864
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:38,159
world there might have been a little bit

865
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,360
of worry about it but they've adopted

866
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,080
this now everybody's adopted this right

867
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,080
we can't see ourselves going back to the

868
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,320
way we used to be before it frees up the

869
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,639
time that creatives need to be creative

870
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,720
right help me lay out my plan for this

871
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:55,240
project it just does it right um hey can

872
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:57,399
you take that and change the colors on

873
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,919
it that used to be hard now you can do

874
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:03,039
five different conv versions right away

875
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,760
right um flushing out the text so what

876
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,960
where you think wow this is a a

877
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,360
threatening role they've actually

878
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,320
adopted it and making it better they're

879
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,360
making it part of their culture because

880
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,559
they took it on in a proactive way to

881
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,840
make it work okay by the way we're doing

882
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,600
this thing called the global opportunity

883
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,600
Forum uh you talked about it um we're

884
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,679
trying to get companies talking to

885
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,679
companies about how you're developing

886
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,600
your

887
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,000
people and discussions on on Career

888
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,880
navigation discussion on training and

889
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,480
many other things uh if you are

890
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,480
interested in this we're you know as I

891
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,559
with ILP we're getting people from ILP

892
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,840
together so if you're interested in it

893
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,080
talk to me talk to UI talk to Graham and

894
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,279
we can link you into the things that

895
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,519
we're doing in this this this initiative

896
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:49,600
okay so one more piece of homework for

897
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,880
you if you're interested if you thought

898
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,519
that these governance questions were

899
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,679
kind of interesting or challenging we

900
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,519
have an article in Harvard Business

901
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:00,200
review about a bank where the digital

902
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:03,360
person wants to go all in and the CEO

903
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:05,000
and the CFO are not quite sure and so it

904
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,799
lays out a bunch of real interesting

905
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,280
problems it's a lot of fun to think

906
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,159
through together about this what would

907
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,800
you do it's also a really interesting

908
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,240
discussion thing for teams to talk

909
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,359
through how they would do it and I will

910
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:19,280
say go forth and read this thing

911
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,240
unfortunately I get zero dollars of

912
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,800
profit from anything you read so it's

913
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,520
just because it's a good thing read this

914
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,919
and see whether it's useful we have a

915
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,399
bunch of other articles also so one last

916
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:30,240
thought those of you who have changed

917
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,440
tires and it turns out that I've learned

918
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,399
that I am a very bad father because my

919
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,839
son got to 25 years old and got a flat

920
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,280
tire and I never taught him how to

921
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:40,480
change a tire um but those of you who

922
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,079
know how to change tires you know you

923
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,520
don't screw down one screw and any the

924
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,480
others you're going to bend the rim that

925
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,200
way you a little bit over here a little

926
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,280
bit over there a little bit over there

927
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,480
and eventually it's in a nice solid

928
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,919
place and uh Ari who runs digital at H&M

929
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,240
said the same thing don't plan it all

930
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:59,040
out in advance try it here try it here

931
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,520
learn from what those what you're doing

932
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,800
there and you're going to make great

933
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,240
things happen for your company okay so

934
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,480
uh here's the conclusion and after that

935
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,520
there are some more articles you can

936
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,240
read on some of these contents if you

937
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,720
want and you can always just send me an

938
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,359
email if you want also I'd love to talk

939
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,920
to you about what you're doing because I

940
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:17,599
can help you with what I know and I'll

941
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,240
learn from the kinds of challenges that

942
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,640
you're going through so conclusion a is

943
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,800
not intelligent it's numbers right it

944
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:26,720
can act very intelligently and so be

945
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,200
creative but also be careful in how you

946
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,920
use it okay

947
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,640
uh number two the right tool for the

948
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,240
right problem not the reverse number

949
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,440
three get

950
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,040
started the best way to work with these

951
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,839
things is to start using to build the

952
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,880
care capability know what they can do

953
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,440
and what they can't for yourself and for

954
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,160
your organization right and and make

955
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,440
sure the policy's there so you can

956
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,760
people can at least avoid doing the

957
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,680
really stupid or really dangerous stuff

958
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,839
and last but not least help your people

959
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,800
your people may be nervous your people

960
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,079
may want to get started on this help

961
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,280
them get there to do great things so I

962
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,599
want to thank you thanks for listening

963
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,760
I'll be in the the room at the breaks

964
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,760
but have fun with the rest of the

965
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,079
afternoon thank you Jorge what question

966
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:19,640
oh we have questions yes I should have

967
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,359
left more time I'm

968
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,599
sorry sorry no questions all right what

969
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:25,200
are the questions do you have

970
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,960
suggestions for navigating bias issues

971
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,880
in models that risk become PR PR

972
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,800
nightwear yeah uh number one if they

973
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,280
become risk becoming PR nightmares be

974
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,640
really careful about your bias right so

975
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,160
uh you know some things you don't really

976
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,680
care that much right uh others you do so

977
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,079
if it's you know if you're giving

978
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,200
medical advice probably you want to make

979
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,599
sure that those are really correct um

980
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,240
when you think about the repeatability

981
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,599
it's an interesting question also

982
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:53,040
because for example human resource

983
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,240
systems if you three look exactly the

984
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,240
same in terms of

985
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,319
capabilities I don't actually care which

986
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,640
one of you three I get

987
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:01,839
right I don't have to choose the same

988
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,880
one but if I have a bias for people like

989
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,760
you against people like that well then I

990
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,880
have to do it so think about you know

991
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,040
the bias the repeatability how much do

992
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,640
you need it uh the way you think about

993
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,359
the bias in this situation is run the

994
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,280
numbers try it out with your sample

995
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,920
group and see whether you're getting

996
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,319
biased answers or not it's the way I

997
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,079
know how to do it um and you can do that

998
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:25,079
in autom weighted way or a less

999
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:27,640
automated way to get there one more

1000
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,319
question was there uh how do you justify

1001
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,200
the value for invested why do people

1002
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:33,319
always ask the question this this same

1003
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,839
way the answer is always the same the

1004
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:36,599
answer is always the same I need to do

1005
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,880
is how do I make my CFO convinced and

1006
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:40,800
the answer doesn't matter on the

1007
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,800
technology come up with a business case

1008
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,599
where you can show the value of using

1009
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,160
it it doesn't matter what the techn heck

1010
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:51,119
e-commerce 25 years ago it was the same

1011
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,880
I'm sorry I don't mean to be insulting

1012
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,640
anybody it's the same answer though find

1013
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,160
somebody who has a business case you can

1014
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,640
solve and try that now the other answer

1015
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,000
is well we don't know the business case

1016
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,319
we just want to invest in experimenting

1017
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,599
well then you're asking for just a

1018
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:06,800
little bit of money and you go out and

1019
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,119
you make the case say this is

1020
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,200
potentially really big I'm going to do

1021
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,520
something with a little bit of money and

1022
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,079
here's what I'm going to do to show

1023
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,839
whether it's the right answer or not

1024
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,160
okay but it doesn't matter gen or

1025
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,079
anything else it's the same answer to

1026
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,960
those those technology questions what

1027
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:22,480
have you found uh well my old company

1028
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,839
wants to start using it how to start

1029
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,079
okay I've given you lots of answers on

1030
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,200
that one uh what have you found very

1031
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,680
advantageous problematic uh you know the

1032
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,599
question is with the geni tools uh

1033
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,800
certainly you want to think about the IP

1034
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,240
issues right are we using somebody

1035
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,079
else's information in what we do the

1036
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,200
tool vendors are starting to negotiate

1037
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,040
those things out so you don't need to

1038
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,480
worry as much for example with whether

1039
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,040
you're using copyrighted imagery that

1040
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,880
should be is part of your vendor

1041
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,599
relationship the other question is um

1042
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,000
you know what happens if I use my

1043
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:00,119
information in a public gener of a i

1044
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,160
tool and the answer for that of course

1045
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,520
is don't use private information in a

1046
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,359
public

1047
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,520
tool okay um which means policy it also

1048
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,640
means helping your employees know the a

1049
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,880
safe place to go because if they don't

1050
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,760
have a safe place to do this they will

1051
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,160
use the public tools okay so companies

1052
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,040
are building up their own private safe

1053
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,599
places they can do this stuff and you

1054
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,000
just help people use that okay it's very

1055
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:27,520
hard to say don't do it because people

1056
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,160
are going to do it uh what do you think

1057
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,240
best way for company to discuss how to

1058
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,160
develop our Workforce talk to me about

1059
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,000
the global opportunity Forum I'd love to

1060
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,400
talk to you more about that and then

1061
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,200
let's see there's one more what

1062
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,319
industries will be most disrupted and

1063
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,160
can be most disrupted that's a really

1064
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:46,280
great question with a really complicated

1065
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:49,760
answer let me just say the places where

1066
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,079
you're heavily information based and

1067
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,960
especially where that information-based

1068
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:56,640
work is a lot of manual work right now

1069
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,920
those are just asking to be disrupted in

1070
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,079
someplace

1071
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,440
I would add one other place the places

1072
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,400
where the Gatekeepers to money or The

1073
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,760
Gatekeepers to customers are information

1074
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,880
based right now and have people

1075
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,400
involved um it's very likely that they

1076
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,160
that that information automation will

1077
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,400
disrupt not that not that all real

1078
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,560
estate agents will go away but they'll

1079
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,640
have to act differently not that all

1080
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,839
lawyers will go away they'll have to act

1081
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,480
differently I I see big changes there

1082
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,440
same thing in finance okay so these are

1083
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,040
not promises don't invest based on that

1084
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,200
but I those those would be some rules I

1085
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,000
would go to look through okay I'm going

1086
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,000
to go away thank you very much see you

1087
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
later
