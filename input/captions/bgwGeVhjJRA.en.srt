1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,839
thank you hi everybody good

2
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:10,000
morning so I'm Natalie ke I'm a slow

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,840
fellow 17 my co-founder uh she's s

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,440
fellow 16 I'm a systems engineer and

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,800
Technology architect she's the

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,600
intellectual property attorney so she's

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,240
keeping our assets very safe and with a

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:26,160
lot of value so uh we work together to

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,480
build this um we are we are a old women

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,599
team from all the rules um this is um

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,880
something because we were building

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,840
something on AI we want to be

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,280
responsible but we also want to be uh

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,440
very conscious around what we're

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,520
building and really be inclusive by

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,719
Design okay so problem right now with

17
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,280
all the things related to hiring is very

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,399
biased because a lot of people with good

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,039
intentions of course we put the best and

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,640
sometimes a lot of more the best of

21
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:56,520
things we have on our resumés profiles

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,039
on job marketplaces on lending

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,359
everywhere so that doesn't help very

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,280
very good tools that are on the market

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,400
that are doing resume screening that are

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,640
doing Talent matching because of data is

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,640
bias is what we put what we reported so

28
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,640
what we're doing right now is okay

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,400
there's data in accuracy here so we need

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:21,240
to solve that so we came to one idea

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,200
after founding that there's standards uh

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,680
right now that are being pushed globally

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,520
around credentials those are verifiable

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,159
credentials that's a standard that um

35
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,360
registers work experience Education

36
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,920
Health and more and this is managed by

37
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,840
digital wallets so all of you at some

38
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,600
point and I think right now you may have

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,840
one of those credentials already but you

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,880
don't know I I'll explain that later if

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,960
you stop by so you can take advantage of

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,280
that so what we're doing is that data is

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,840
real because it gets verifications from

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,920
several parties you can know that data

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,640
and then we are collecting that data so

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,320
you heard in some of the expositions

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,680
before that AI is cool but the is the

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,920
data sometimes if it's biased or it's

49
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,960
really not super good so what we're

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,440
doing is providing those credentials a

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,200
source of retraining those

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,040
tools or providing our own tools we have

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,200
our own chat Bots and so to really

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,080
improve the hiring process so the key

55
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,680
here is not to have better tools or

56
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,319
better algorithms or better models is to

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,239
have a better data at the end so what

58
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,440
we're doing right now is we have

59
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,560
credential verification this is very

60
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,440
mechanical we keep doing and we keep

61
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,879
collecting data we have ai matching and

62
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,920
then we have two things here one we

63
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,239
provide our own tools to companies that

64
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,720
want to hire better faster we improve

65
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,800
that processing

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,800
90% uh and efforts and time or we

67
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,560
provide other platforms that are on need

68
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,280
of this better data like job

69
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,519
marketplaces HR platforms and others

70
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,360
that can consume our data to do better

71
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,239
with their tools we also have um

72
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,959
connection with digital wallets globally

73
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,200
that i r now um deploying globally as

74
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:06,040
well so you can manage those credentials

75
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,280
that we can acquire that data from there

76
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,879
too okay so trusted data this is number

77
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,319
one we also have blockchain of course we

78
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,280
use it and leverage to to keep that data

79
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,640
safe if we also have Global reach what

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,959
is the key from our customers uh during

81
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,159
the pandemic and after the pandemic they

82
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,599
realized that that was better uh there

83
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,319
was a lot of talent globally that they

84
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,680
weren't able to reach also universities

85
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,200
they realized that there was a lot of

86
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,360
global opportunities but they need to

87
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,319
help uh their students or alumni to get

88
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,760
to those opportunities this of course

89
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,280
helps to move the talent pool around the

90
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,200
world so we have a company that can get

91
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,439
our tools or Empower their own tools to

92
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,280
get better job matches and we can also

93
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,959
get talent that use our chat Bo to say

94
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,879
okay I got I need to put my resume

95
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,599
better or what are the opportunities

96
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,480
worldwide that I can get based on my

97
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,519
real profile so that's the type of

98
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,599
things we're doing with users and

99
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,799
companies today well also as well

100
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,280
helping other platforms to get that data

101
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,599
to do better matches okay ask what we're

102
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,360
doing with companies right now we're

103
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,840
running Pilots some of them are paying

104
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,319
customers as well to get this to 90%

105
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,160
better it's not a lot of effort we need

106
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,000
some data but we'll get in there second

107
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,360
academic a lot of universities are

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
asking us and we're working with them to

109
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,680
have this credentials that get their

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,880
talent sposed globally so they can get

111
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,759
better opportunities of course I

112
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,600
educational institutions are welcome to

113
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,199
come and this is the plot twist we are

114
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,720
working with other startups not only

115
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,600
from MIT to get better data to these

116
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,199
platforms to the platforms that are

117
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,880
running right now so we are not the only

118
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,120
ones collecting this data we are not the

119
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,840
only ones trying to get better AI um

120
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,160
there's a lot of other companies doing

121
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,280
this so please join us to to do that

122
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,280
thank you so much for having us
