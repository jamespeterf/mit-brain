1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,920
okay so now that we've seen that gene

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,759
expression programs are important in

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,440
health and disease and can tell us a lot

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:10,400
about what's going on in the tissue

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,200
let's talk about how we actually measure

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,199
the genes in the tissues so we're going

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,039
to use a technology called spatial

8
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:20,320
transcriptomics to measure a gene

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,160
expression in a tissue using Imaging so

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,439
in spatial transcriptomics we are

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,160
measuring the expression of every Gene

12
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,960
inside every cell in a tissue so here

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:32,040
I've taken a piece of colon tissue in

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,079
the h& stain and I have outlined the

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,079
border of every single cell in that

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,280
tissue and this is called segmentation

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,120
and inside these cells I would like to

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,600
say what genes are expressed and what

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,360
genes are not expressed and to do this

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,440
we're going to use one of the many

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,719
Technologies out there to do spatial

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,320
transcriptomics we're going to use uh

23
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,120
the zenium instrument made by the

24
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,320
company 10x genomics and we are going to

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,399
use this to measure gene expression in

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,120
the colon

27
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,760
tissues so here on the left we have have

28
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,600
an h& stain of the colon mucosa and the

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,600
sub mucosa we have the epithelial layer

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,280
the muscle layer that separates mucosa

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,080
and sub mucosa and uh we're going to run

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,240
the zenium spatial transcriptomics

33
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,400
instrument and measure the expression of

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,880
genes inside cells so here's an example

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,240
of that measurement where we have

36
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,159
measured the gene epcam which is

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,600
normally expressed in epithelial cells

38
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,040
and what we're showing here is every

39
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,640
single dot is a single uh epcam Gene

40
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,079
transcript so the epcam gene was

41
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,840
transcribed and an RNA molecule was made

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,280
and each of these dots is one of those

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,280
RNA molecules or transcripts and what

44
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,040
you can see is that the location of the

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,200
RNA molecules for epcam perfectly

46
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,240
overlap with where the epithelium is as

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,680
judged by the h& image so that's really

48
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,560
beautiful uh we can measure another Gene

49
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,759
Desmond desmin is normally expressed in

50
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,600
muscle cells and we can see that the

51
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,640
Desmond Gene is showing up in this

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,399
muscle layer and again we can compare it

53
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,399
to the h& image and these the h& image

54
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,479
and the zenium spal transcriptomic

55
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,200
measur they have the same coordinate

56
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,120
system because these measurements are

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,160
made from the exact same piece of colon

58
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,360
tissue then finally we can look at this

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,560
other Gene dearin which is more spread

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,200
out but it's normally found expressed in

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,360
the sub mucosa so the bottom of the h&

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,120
image and now we can keep doing this

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,920
over and over and over and we can

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,480
measure many many genes and here I've

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,519
superimposed into one image all Gene

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,160
transcripts that we measured during our

67
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,560
during our spatial transcriptomic

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,159
experiment and there are 480 genes whose

69
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,599
expression we were able to measure in

70
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:46,840
the colon tissue so you can think of

71
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,000
this as a 480 Channel image and you can

72
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,640
compare that to the h& image which is

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,879
really a three Channel image it has red

74
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,239
green and blue so you're getting a lot

75
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,519
of information here uh from these

76
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,080
spatial transcriptomic

77
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,720
measurements so now I'd like to just

78
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,920
walk you through how a spatial

79
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,480
transcriptomics experiment works this is

80
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,640
a bit technical so don't worry if um you

81
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,959
don't understand every single detail but

82
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,560
we wanted to walk you through this

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,879
because it's such cool technology so it

84
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,879
starts with us placing a tissue on a

85
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,080
zenium slide zenium is the spatial

86
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,760
transcriptomic instrument we're using

87
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:28,480
and then once the tisue is placed on the

88
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,319
slide we add DNA probes that are going

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,080
to bind to every Gene transcript in a

90
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,519
specific manner based on complimentary D

91
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,319
DNA Bas pairing now these probes also

92
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,720
have an optical barcode that's encoded

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,400
in in the DNA sequence and there is a

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,720
unique Optical barcode for every Gene we

95
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,760
would like to measure so epcam has one

96
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,519
Optical barcode and Desmond has a

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,319
different Optical barcode now how do we

98
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,439
read out these Optical bar codes and

99
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,400
identify the gene uh that we have uh

100
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,400
have the prob bind to and that's just

101
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,319
really elegant scheme where we're going

102
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,840
to read the sequence of the optical

103
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:09,200
barcode using rounds of microscopic

104
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,760
Imaging so this is kind of similar to um

105
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,480
you know how you would use your phone to

106
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,599
scan a QR code so you might go to a

107
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,160
restaurant and you scan a QR code and

108
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,440
it's for the McDonald's menu and then

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,320
you go to another restaurant you scan

110
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,320
the QR code and it's for the Burger King

111
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,199
menu so those are two different QR codes

112
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,960
the link to two different menus in the

113
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,639
same way we're going to be reading out

114
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,840
these Optical barcodes and they are

115
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,000
going to be linking to different genes

116
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,520
that are being uh expressed inside that

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,880
cell so here's how that works where

118
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,160
we're going to have rounds of Imaging

119
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,400
where every single round of Imaging we

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,039
read out one character of the optical

121
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,720
barcode and the optical barcode is

122
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:47,840
encoded uh or decoded using fluorescent

123
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,759
molecules so here we have a cartoon of

124
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,199
the cell with the nucleus at the center

125
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,479
and we have different transcripts that

126
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,280
we're reading out and every time we do a

127
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,560
round of Imaging we read out one

128
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,320
character of that Optical barcode so

129
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,800
here in RNA molecule one the first uh

130
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,840
character is orange in an RNA molecule 2

131
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,320
the first character is purple in an RNA

132
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,000
molecule 3 the first character is red

133
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,960
and then we do another round of Imaging

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,520
and another round of Imaging and as we

135
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,800
do this we build out an entire Optical

136
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,160
barcode sequence where again every

137
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,440
single barcode is preassigned and unique

138
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,960
to a specific Gene so for instance this

139
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,639
first barcode which goes um orange blue

140
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,199
green yellow that encodes the Gene epcam

141
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,720
and a different barcode encodes cd3d and

142
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,000
so on so this is a really elegant scheme

143
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,880
by which we can measure all the

144
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,919
transcripts for for the cells in that

145
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,240
tissue and again this is just done by

146
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,240
rounds of Imaging on a

147
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,800
microscope so once we've identified all

148
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,120
the genes in the cells and the tissue we

149
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,360
still have to say uh which cell each

150
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,800
transcript belongs to so how we do that

151
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,600
is first we need to identify the cells

152
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,000
in the tissue and what we do is we apply

153
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,199
a special stain called dappy and when

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,039
applied to the tissue this stains the

155
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,560
nucleus of the cell sort of the center

156
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,520
of the cell blue and then at the same

157
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,639
time uh we have the location of the

158
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,160
transcripts here and we need to assign

159
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,520
them to the nearest nuclei essentially

160
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,160
and so what we do is we carry out a

161
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,319
segmentation process where we draw

162
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,199
polygons around the cells that are going

163
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,520
to separate each individual cell and

164
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,840
this is often done using a deep learning

165
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,680
algorithm to detect the boundary of the

166
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,639
nucleus and the boundaries and then once

167
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,240
these boundaries have been made and the

168
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,840
cells have been segmented now we can say

169
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,599
this transcript belongs to the green

170
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,520
cell here and this other transcript

171
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:43,800
belongs to the purple cell here so at

172
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,000
this point we have identified the gene

173
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,199
transcripts and assigned them to

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
individual cells so let's review what

175
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,639
the ultimate data that you'll receive

176
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,160
looks like so here we're showing uh the

177
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,720
h& image and we're showing one uh Gene

178
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,599
epcam and it's being expressed in these

179
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,240
little purple sorry cyan dots uh this is

180
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,599
where it's being expressed and we can

181
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,000
see again that it's really in the

182
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,520
epithelium in these colonic Crypts and

183
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,919
that's what we expect to see um we can

184
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,919
look at another Gene uh mki67 this is a

185
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,000
gene that's expressed in epithelial stem

186
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,680
cells it's involved in making more cells

187
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,960
um and these stem cells tend to reside

188
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,560
at the base of these colonic Crypts and

189
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,120
you can kind of see that they have this

190
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,000
specific localization at the base and

191
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,720
the third Gene I'll show you is des

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,919
which you've seen before and it's really

193
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,000
showing up in the muscle cells so you

194
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,720
have this really nice alignment between

195
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,520
the h& image and Gene transcripts that

196
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,960
Mark different cell types and states in

197
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,560
the cells in the

198
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,759
tissue let's look at another example

199
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,520
here we're in the submucosa now and

200
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,319
we're looking at a gene plvap that marks

201
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,840
endothelial cells endothelial cells line

202
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,440
your blood vessels and so the plvap is

203
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,120
sort of forming this circular tube and

204
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,680
then inside you actually see this mass

205
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,039
of red and those are red blood cells

206
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,759
that are carrying oxygen uh they're

207
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:09,479
bringing oxygen into the

208
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:12,080
tissue another Gene I want to show is

209
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,280
snap 25 this is a gene that's expressed

210
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,520
in neurons it's involved in your neurons

211
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,879
making synapses and the neurons are here

212
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,639
and here in this myeric plexus or nerve

213
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,240
fiber that's in between the circular

214
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,360
muscle and the longitudinal muscle so

215
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,800
again the spatial transcriptomic is

216
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,560
really highlighting to us specific genes

217
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,719
that Mark cell types and states that we

218
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,039
know are important in the tissue and

219
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,000
then finally I'll show you one last

220
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,159
example which is this lymphoid aggregate

221
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,519
which is a collection of immune cells

222
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,040
that aggregate in the mucosa and you see

223
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,800
in the h& stain this sort of heavy

224
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,519
patterning of a blue nuclei so immune

225
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,240
cells are often quite small and they're

226
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,480
mostly just these small blue nuclei

227
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,959
under an H stain and in this lymphoid

228
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,600
aggregate we have two different cell

229
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,920
types um T cells and B cells in addition

230
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,680
in addition to other cells but but the T

231
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,519
cells are marked by CD3 Delta and that's

232
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,480
shown in yellow and the B cells are

233
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:09,800
marked by cd79 Alpha and shown in green

234
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,880
here and so again we're able to really

235
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,720
pick out these really fine structures of

236
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,440
the colon tissue using spatial

237
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,079
transcriptomics so this is you know in a

238
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,240
sense what your data is going to look

239
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:24,120
like that you're working with across

240
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,200
these three crunches you're going to be

241
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,560
receiving h& images of colon tissue and

242
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,959
uler of citis tissue and you're going to

243
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,240
be having paired zenium spatial

244
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:36,720
transcriptomic measurements where all

245
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,640
genes 480 genes have been measured and

246
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,839
here again they're just shown as uh

247
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,720
little dots for where each dot is a

248
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,959
location of a transcript and then we'll

249
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,000
also provide you with a segmentation

250
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,320
which is going to tell you uh what cell

251
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,920
each transcript is being expressed

252
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,880
in so this is a lot to take in but maybe

253
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,640
one of the things you might have noticed

254
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:03,320
me say is that we're measuring a about

255
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,120
480 genes and what you recall from the

256
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,839
beginning of this uh lecture is that

257
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,320
there actually 20,000 genes in the human

258
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,920
genome so what about the remaining

259
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,760
19520 genes that we didn't measure like

260
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,519
what can we say about those genes so in

261
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,440
the last part of this lecture I will

262
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,040
explain to you how we can measure those

263
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,040
genes as well
