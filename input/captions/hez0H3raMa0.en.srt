1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,719
Wow, that was intense, wasn't it? So,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,960
let me lighten up the

3
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:17,080
mood. So, I heard that there was a frog

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,279
that arrived late to this conference

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,920
today. Can you guess

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:27,599
why? I heard that his car was

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,720
towed. So, that intensity has gone down

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,079
a little bit. Let me first welcome you

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,800
to today's conference and I'm um excited

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,719
uh about the agenda and I'm uh thrilled

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,719
to see you all here and I hope you're

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,480
going to get as much excitement and

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,600
knowledge from this conference that I'm

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,760
hoping I will and um and I'm I'm sure

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,520
you'll get back uh with a lot of uh

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,600
anecdotes. So I'm Gaitri Shini Vasan.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,160
I'm the executive director at MIT

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,719
corporate relations and today we gather

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,879
here not just as representatives to our

20
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,280
respective organizations

21
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,720
um but you know also uh as part of the

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,840
global community um that believes in the

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,680
power of connections and partnerships

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,520
and uh at MIT corporate relations we are

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,680
committed to um building meaningful

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,720
relationships fostering strategic

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,640
alliances and creating lasting impact.

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,119
acts. As we explore the opportunities

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,920
and challenges of uh our connected

30
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,759
world, I am reminded of the importance

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,759
of collaboration and mutual

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,240
support. You know what we can do is

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,920
drive positive change on a global scale.

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,840
So that's why these kind of conferences

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,640
are important for you to attend and

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,720
listen in and spread the word. Let me

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,799
start first of all by thanking three

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,520
people. um Steve Whitaker um Jim Flynn

39
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,000
and Graham Wrong uh for their tireless

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,799
work in putting together this agenda

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,040
that uh you're going to be um exploring

42
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,399
uh

43
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:09,080
today. Um sorry I can you please uh go

44
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,640
to the next slide? I think I forgot

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,480
my

46
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,760
clicker. Um I wanted to start out with

47
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,080
the fact what is MIT? MIT is comprised

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,319
of 17,000ish

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,360
uh employees, um 1,000 uh professors,

50
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,680
4,300 uh

51
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,800
researchers, 105 Nobel Prize winners,

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,879
and yes, you heard that right, 105 Nobel

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,400
Prize winners, and we have the latest

54
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:42,200
ones um here on uh their pictures uh

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,680
shown to you. Um and of course 4,500

56
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,519
undergraduates 7,300 graduate students

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,519
and the composition of our students is

58
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,519
29%

59
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,760
international also at MIT we are a very

60
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,040
researchheavy intense uh uh institute

61
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,800
right so there's 65 plus research uh

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,280
centers and programs um 840 million

63
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,360
onampus sponsored research And you see

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,080
that I said on campus because I'm not

65
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,560
counting Lincoln Lab, which is a whole

66
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,760
other amount of research that happens

67
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:25,599
there. Uh 608 US patents, 323 patents

68
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:29,120
issued, um three $39.3 million in

69
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:33,560
licensing revenue, 24 startup companies

70
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,720
formed using MIT ILP. Sorry, MIT IP, not

71
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,920
ILP. But I do want to also underscore

72
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,000
the fact that you know of all the uh

73
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,799
industry funded research that happens

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,280
about half of them are because of

75
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:51,360
collaborations with members such as you

76
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,360
who identify places to collaborate with

77
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,760
MIT. I also wanted to share a few MIT's

78
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,599
past AI contributions. You may know some

79
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,439
of them but I just wanted to showcase

80
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,840
this foundations for so from 1950s to60s

81
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,400
pioneers such as Marvin Minsky and John

82
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,120
McCarthy conceived foundational concepts

83
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,760
in AI lisp I'm sure some people have

84
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,239
heard this was in 1958 among the

85
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,000
earliest programming languages developed

86
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,600
for AI Eliza in the 1960s one of the

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,840
first chat bots right who would have

88
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,560
thought that 60s we had a chatbot I

89
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,000
didn't know that um Apollo guidance

90
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,600
computer uh 1960s to the '7s. This

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,160
helped with the Apollo missions, right?

92
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,520
Um the moon landing uh and then many

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:41,000
other variable computing uh effective um

94
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,919
computing um gesture interfaces,

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,960
Mindstorm, smart cities, liquid AI and

96
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,040
many more. I'm just highlighting a few.

97
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,520
And again, all these happen at MIT and

98
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,759
MIT is such an interdisciplinary place.

99
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,160
It's not happening at one place, right?

100
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,479
It's happening through MIT Seale. You'll

101
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,560
see a little bit of some of these people

102
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,759
represented in the other room. So when

103
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,600
you have lunch or networking uh breaks,

104
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,639
please go and meet with them. Schwarzman

105
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,000
College of Computing, Media Lab, Sloan

106
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:16,080
School of Management, um uh MIT IBM

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,960
Watson AI Lab, uh Lincoln Lab, LIDS, and

108
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,400
the MIT Generative uh AI impact

109
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,360
consortium, which you'll hear about

110
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,360
later in the agenda today.

111
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,520
The MIT campus as I mentioned it's very

112
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,320
interdicciplinary right so the campus

113
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,120
and the Kendall square have become very

114
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,680
dense environment often referred to as

115
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,840
the most innovative square mile on the

116
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,160
planet extending from the east to the

117
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,280
west along the Charles River with views

118
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,080
of downtown Boston our campus continues

119
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,160
to expand right once it was an

120
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,479
industrial area I'll show you a picture

121
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,960
later it has transformed into a major

122
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,000
innovation hub lab new now home to more

123
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,759
than 150 high-tech companies including

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,560
the most prominent names in life

125
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,919
sciences, technology, and

126
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,120
pharmaceuticals. Our office is centrally

127
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,360
located on campus and offers companies a

128
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,120
dedicated space to collaborate and

129
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,639
explore new opportunities to advance

130
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,360
innovation. But this recent growth um

131
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,759
with this recent growth the ILP remains

132
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,639
committed to enhancing support for

133
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,199
companies to connect with the uh culture

134
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,240
of continuous exchange among uh industry

135
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,840
and academia and

136
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,039
government. With that I promise the next

137
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,520
picture. This is how Kendall Square was

138
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,840
in the 60s and 70s. It was like an

139
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:42,160
industrial place with surface parking

140
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,800
loting place right? I mean um there was

141
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,400
not that much happening and look at how

142
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,160
it is now. This is how it is in 2025.

143
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,600
It's amazing right the transformation

144
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,639
that has happened. Um so I I just want

145
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,360
you to know that the campus and MIT like

146
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,120
the Kendall Square commercial side and

147
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,960
MIT campus are not two different things.

148
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,919
They are integrated and porous.

149
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,520
This is what uh is the composition of

150
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,280
companies MIT and all um uh surrounding

151
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,680
areas. Right? So Kendall Square is home

152
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,199
to one of the densest concentration of

153
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,240
innovation and entrepreneurship around

154
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,520
the world hosting um the leading biotech

155
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,960
companies. So you can see the different

156
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,800
color codes, right?

157
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,520
Maroon is all MIT. The pink is biioarma.

158
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,880
Uh the blue the dark blue is venture

159
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,280
capital. The turquoise is IT data and

160
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,160
technology. And the green are energy

161
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,039
related

162
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,120
companies. Now let me come to MIT. Uh I

163
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,560
said I'm from MIT corporate relations.

164
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,160
But what is corporate relations?

165
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,280
Corporate relations is all about

166
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,759
connecting MIT to industry and industry

167
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,319
to MIT. And we try to do that through

168
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,879
four um uh pillars research innovation

169
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,879
students and education or upskilling and

170
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,879
reskilling. So how do we do that is

171
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,879
through two integrated programs

172
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,879
industrial leazison program and the

173
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,120
startup exchange and in the industrial

174
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,759
leazison program is a comprehensive

175
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,759
portal to MIT and the startup exchange

176
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,840
promotes collaboration between MIT

177
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,720
connected startups with uh industry

178
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,120
partners.

179
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
Um we have 200 plus member companies in

180
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,759
the industrial leazison program. Some of

181
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:31,440
you are here represented and 800 plus

182
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:33,760
MIT connected uh startup uh companies.

183
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,080
And I want you to see when I say 200

184
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,159

welcome to Boston for the uh first ILP

212
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,839
conference of the year. Uh very much

213
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,360
focused on the kind of the

214
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,680
transformative

215
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,839
uh potential of reality of of AI,

216
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,000
artificial intelligence. As Gathri

217
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,680
mentioned, AI really runs through the

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,800
veins and bones of the institute and has

219
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,720
done since 1959 when the AI lab was

220
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,320
first founded and then was through the

221
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,480
media lab through computer science and

222
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,680
AI lab and the Schwartzman Center. Um,

223
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm Steve Whitaker. I'm one of the

224
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,680
program directors that Gareth just

225
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,800
mentioned. Uh, and I've uh been having a

226
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,959
lot of fun for the last few months

227
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,560
working with Jim and Graeme who you'll

228
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,120

229
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,360
together. Um, we've got a a fairly

230
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,720
packed day for you. We've got 17 faculty

231
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,000
and researchers, uh 10 uh star MIT

232
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,920
related startups. So, we're going to do

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,120
some fairly brutal timekeeping, I'm

234
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,160
afraid. So, we'll kind of try to keep

235
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,160
everybody on uh on track.
