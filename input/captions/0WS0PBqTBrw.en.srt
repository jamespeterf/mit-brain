1
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,000
Uh next we're going to hear from Ania

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,199
Kamargo who is uh associate director of

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,519
thermal networks at the building

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:30,080
decarbonization coalition to talk about

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,119
that rapidly evolving policy landscape.

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,200
And there's a little clicker.

7
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,280
>> And there's clicker up there, I think.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,280
>> All right.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,800
>> Okay. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Um,

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,879
so I you see I have geo there in

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,640
parenthesis and that is because most of

12
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,960
the legislation that has the legislation

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,640
that's passed to date uses the term uh

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,960
thermal energy network. So you will be

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,440
hearing me say that, but in general I'm

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,199
talking about the broad category of both

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,199
geothermal energy networks and thermal

18
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,559
energy networks. And I'm just going to

19
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,079
give you a picture of what's happening

20
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,559
nationally.

21
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,840
So here is how a bill becomes law. This

22
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,240
is real. Um it is just never a straight

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,840
line. It's very messy. And the reason

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,680
why it's messy is kind of what delegate

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,520
Shakudin was saying. It's about bringing

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,960
stakeholders together with different

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,119
interests and making sure that all of

28
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,200
their interests are being met. So rarely

29
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,360
does the start end up like the finish.

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,360
But the really good news with uh thermal

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,119
networks is that states are learning

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,280
from each other. So this is coming

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,640
becoming a little less muddy and uh

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,880
legislation is moving really fast.

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,479
Um so again I'm going to start with this

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,560
one on like what's the general journey

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,240
that we're seeing in legislation and

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,360
again I have the word utility up there

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,960
because the only uh anyone can build a

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,200
thermal network right now uh

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,360
municipality lots of colleges and

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,159
universities a hospital anyone except

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,720
for a regulated utility. And so we have

44
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,880
to pass legislation to allow gas and

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,360
electric or water companies to sell

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,799
thermal or to build thermal networks. So

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,360
the way it starts is exactly like uh

48
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,040
delegate Shudian said it's in all the

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,119
states that were working or that are

50
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,680
passing this legislation. It's really a

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,440
group of advocates. In her case, she was

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,280
the legislator who started, but then she

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,640
worked with all the people here. As you

54
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,680
heard this morning from Kelsey, it

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,560
started with mothers out front. Um and

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,280
then the underpinning of this for the

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,120
legislation that has passed so far is

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,599
that all of the states so eight bills

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,120
have passed all of the states have

60
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,760
significant climate commitments of at

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,680
least reducing total emissions by 75% or

62
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,239
more um and greening the grid um so RPS

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,840
commitments and seven out of the eight

64
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,400
that have passed have future of gas

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,160
proceedings meaning the regulators have

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,680
said hey gas companies how are you going

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
to meet these commitments so this is

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,400
what's happened to date, not necessarily

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,879
will happen in the future, but this is

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,599
the kind of bills are very attached to

71
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,840
our missions. Um, once legislation

72
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,760
passes, there's a whole process that

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,920
kicks off with the regulators, which you

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,959
will hear after me from Sher Van

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,120
Nostrin, but it's a it's a kind of a

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,879
negotiation between the utilities and

77
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,040
the regulators looking at the

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,640
legislation that passed, saying, "Okay,

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,159
what needs to happen for us to be able

80
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,680
to move forward?" At the same time,

81
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,120
you're going to have to be working on

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,879
the, you know, the workforce, supply

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,280
chain, making sure there's community

84
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,480
outreach, etc. And then you can get to

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,080
construction. Um, so so far only one

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,319
project, which is here in Massachusetts,

87
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,239
has made it through construction. And

88
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,159
all of the bills that have passed uh

89
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,959
require data collection and pilot

90
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,239
evaluation. So this is this is again,

91
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,599
every state is different, but this is

92
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,080
the broad thing that we're seeing across

93
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,120
the state that gets uh legislation

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,400
passed. And here are the eight bills um

95
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,319
the eight states that have passed.

96
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,120
They're listed there on the right. Uh

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,120
you will notice uh 2021 Massachusetts

98
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,680
passed the first bill that allowed uh

99
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,640
network geothermal. And just this year

100
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,720
2024 four bills passed as well as

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,120
several states did another round of

102
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,200
passing legislation. Uh and then you see

103
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,840
there dark blue considering legislation.

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,319
Actually uh just this month already five

105
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,920
new states have filed legislation. So,

106
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,239
we are expecting this to continue to

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,760
grow.

108
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,519
And this, you don't need to read this.

109
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,359
Uh, it's just to give you a sense of

110
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,880
what's in these bills. You see the

111
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,720
states across the top, and you can sort

112
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,800
of see what the provisions are. And the

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,560
key thing about here is the states are

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,199
learning from each other. And this is on

115
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,880
our website, so you can check it out.

116
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,240
Um, all right. So, now I'm going to

117
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,400
combine it. Like, what does this all

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,160
mean? And it's really about how does the

119
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,400
the technology and the stuff on the

120
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,199
ground relate to the legislation and the

121
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,720
regulation. So here's a great uh diagram

122
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,320
that heat put together. It's a gas

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,160
system. And you can see that very cute

124
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,320
little section of green. That's the

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,520
thermal network. And so this is the

126
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,600
demonstration. All eight bills uh either

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,120
allow or mandate pilot. So everyone is

128
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,840
starting with demonstration. So what's

129
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,040
the kind of uh work that comes with

130
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,600
that? The bills include

131
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,360
um a whole series of things that are

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,759
about these pilots, right? So the

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,800
definitions uh ownership is really

134
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,520
interesting in starting with New York.

135
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,919
The the legislation actually says gas

136
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,479
and electric utilities can own and

137
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,320
operate thermal energy networks. And

138
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,400
then several of the states after that

139
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,759
implemented the same thing. Uh

140
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,960
Massachusetts, we just passed

141
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,600
legislation 2024 that allows the selling

142
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,440
of thermal energy by the gas utilities.

143
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,960
Um some include environmental

144
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,440
protections, labor standards. You just

145
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,160
heard from Ryan in New York, that group

146
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,080
of advocates, one of the core uh members

147
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,919
of that group of advocates were labor

148
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,160
leaders. And so they're very strong

149
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,440
labor standards in the New York bill

150
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,600
that are about the geothermal workforce

151
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,759
in general, but also about the existing

152
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,360
gas for uh workforce and how that how

153
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,800
they're going to be transitioned as part

154
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,120
of this um consumer protection. I should

155
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,919
say also environmental justice in there

156
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,639
that uh many of the bills again starting

157
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,160
with New York require at least one pilot

158
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,360
to be in an environmental justice

159
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,120
community and uh several of them say

160
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,400
that they the customer should not have

161
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,280
to pay more than what they're currently

162
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,840
paying on their bills. All of them

163
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,080
include cost recovery. So the pilots can

164
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,639
go through the rates, but the issue is

165
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,400
what's included. And so the states vary

166
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,919
in that. Here in Massachusetts,

167
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,520
everything could go through the rates.

168
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,520
In California, for example, all of the

169
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,000
behind the meter costs, which are pretty

170
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,080
significant, all the retrofits uh

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,319
cannot. And so they're struggling with

172
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,080
how we're going to pay for that. Um and

173
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,000
then pilot data collection and

174
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,440
reporting. I guess I already said

175
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,360
they're all doing this anyway. So this

176
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,600
is sort of how this works. Next step

177
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,960
um is development. And this is now where

178
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,560
we're starting here in Massachusetts.

179
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,319
It's like you grab what you learned from

180
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,560
that first pilot and now we're

181
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,520
expanding. And how's that going to work?

182
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,039
And so through that, some of these bills

183
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,440
are starting to pass and there's some

184
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,120
conversations. Um interim rate design,

185
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,039
how are we going to design the rates to

186
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,199
deal with this? Uh amending the

187
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,000
obligation to serve. This is a huge one.

188
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,880
Many states file legislation to try to

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,560
change this. and a full uh I I I'm going

190
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,720
to explain what that is, which is if any

191
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,520
one of those little house green houses

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,120
says, "No, I want to stay on gas." It

193
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,520
means that the gas system has to stay,

194
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,639
you can't pull it back. And so amending

195
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,720
it so that the gas um utilities can

196
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,960
expand their service to not just be

197
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,919
about gas, but also to be or to sell

198
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,280
thermal energy allows them to then say,

199
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,800
"Okay, we're going to provide you

200
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,440
heating and cooling, but it's not going

201
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,560
to be with gas." And so so far two

202
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,599
states have touched that. Uh Washington

203
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,360
state for thermal energy networks are

204
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,199
allowed to meet the obligation to serve

205
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,479
with thermal. And California has a

206
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,360
really interesting one where they said

207
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,840
60% if 60% of a street or the segment

208
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
that they're taking the gas pipe out of

209
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,120
says that they want a thermal network

210
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,879
then they're allowed to meet the

211
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,440
obligation to serve that way. Um gas oh

212
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,560
so then uh joint electric planning. This

213
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,280
is uh our commissioner uh chair van will

214
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,639
talk about this but basically the one of

215
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,240
the biggest benefits of putting in these

216
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,160
thermal networks is the impact on the

217
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,400
electric grid and so being able to have

218
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,319
that joint planning and prioritizing of

219
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,960
where these things should be built is

220
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,720
really important and so we're starting

221
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,120
to see that already and not only in

222
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,039
Massachusetts but elsewhere and thinking

223
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,960
of okay which like if you're going to

224
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,560
replace a pipe that's an obvious place

225
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,399
uh if you if you're going to build a

226
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,760
substation an electric substation

227
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,839
because you're running out of capacity.

228
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,880
Maybe that's a great place. So, that's

229
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,640
starting. Um, and then of course the

230
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,159
full system transition, which is what we

231
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,519
all want, is going to require a lot

232
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,920
more. And this uh really hasn't started.

233
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,519
I mean, we've filed some of this this

234
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,839
cycle for two years from now here in

235
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,880
Massachusetts. But creating a thermal

236
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,760
market, allowing folks to buy and sell

237
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,200
energy, uh, integrating utilities, gas,

238
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,839
electric, and potentially even water.

239
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,839
like water has the water utilities also

240
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,160
have a lot of thermal energy. Uh waste

241
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,920
heat recovery, how is what's the what

242
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,480
are the rules going to be around that?

243
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,560
Uh tactical transition plans for whole

244
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,959
cities and regions. And so this idea

245
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,480
that you can map out, you know, how old

246
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,320
your pipe is, you know, what's going to

247
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,920
have to be taken down, what's going to

248
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,760
make the most sense for everything and

249
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,760
how can we transition the whole system

250
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,720
thinking 10 years ahead and not just

251
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,320
five or two. Um and then the final rate

252
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,160
design you know still in consideration

253
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,360
and I I'm involved in a few dockets

254
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,120
across the country in some places the

255
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,000
combination of the electric I mean I'm

256
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,519
sorry of the thermal and geo rate makes

257
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,519
a lot of sense right it's being covered

258
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,880
by all the customers some folks are

259
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,200
fighting that and saying no it should be

260
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,720
by itself and then in New York there's

261
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,120
one utility who's saying it should be

262
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,720
covered by both gas and electric because

263
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,320
the electric customers are the ones that

264
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,240
are most benefiting. Um I I talked about

265
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,760
allowable cost recovery and then big is

266
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,320
the the voided cost uh uh integration

267
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,720
into the thermal networks because what

268
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,320
is happening is that the that benefit on

269
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,920
the electric grid means that we're not

270
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,640
going to have to build out the electric

271
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,600
grid but the costs are on the network

272
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,760
geothermal installer like so so the

273
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,279
benefits and the costs are not aligned

274
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,079
and so we have to figure out how to do

275
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,920
that. Um, so that's sort of how the

276
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,880
policy and this thing is we're hoping

277
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,480
it's going to roll out. Um, and I just

278
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,720
want to say remember only eight states

279
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,560
have passed legislation, but this map

280
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,800
looks a lot better than that, which is

281
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,200
utilities across the country are really

282
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,959
interested in doing this. Um, regardless

283
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,279
of whether legislation has passed or

284
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,680
not, this is the a map of the utility

285
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,839
net geo collaborative and both blues are

286
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,519
actually members of that collaborative.

287
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:52,000
Um and uh they are basically exploring

288
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,600
the exploring what this looks like for

289
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,560
them. And the the maps the light blue is

290
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,279
states where at least uh one utility has

291
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,120
filed a pilot. So far there's been 22

292
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,680
pilots filed with the regulatory

293
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,000
commission. And then I just also want to

294
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,399
end with this map which I hope you'll

295
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,399
all check out because you can click on

296
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,560
what type of owners, what the status is

297
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,120
and the type of thermal networks and

298
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,320
just see that actually we have a lot of

299
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,320
projects in this country and that

300
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,690
there's huge opportunity for learning

301
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:29,919
across projects and that is everything.

302
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,919
[Applause]
