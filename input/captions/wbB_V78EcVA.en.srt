1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,080
hello everybody I want to explain a

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,439
little bit on how we can visualize music

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,600
using music 21 or other tools and how

4
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:23,560
important it is to be able to see what

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,480
is happening in a piece of music rather

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,000
than going through Jupiter notebook the

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,200
users guide to music 21 chapter 22 which

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,440
there's a link past into the page that

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,440
this is on has a good introduction to

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,559
some of the things that you can do with

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,480
graphing and

12
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:44,879
plotting we can go ahead and start by

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,800
importing everything from Usef 21 we

14
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,840
really only need the Corpus and there's

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,680
one piece by the Italian 19th century

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:58,640
opera composer JP Verde from his opera

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,960
roletto called Ladon Mo which we can

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,839
load in using the Corpus parse function

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,600
and store its variable Verity let's just

20
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,840
look at the first 10 measures and we can

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,840
show

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,200
it you probably may have heard this

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,960
before so it's a little piano score

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:25,640
version and so let's just get the vocal

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,280
part and if we go ahead and call on this

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,240
exerpt oh by the way I don't know if we

27
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,720
fully explained you can extract a

28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,240
measure range

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,119
with these two numbers uh this is

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,520
inclusive uh unlike Python and so this

31
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,200
will include measure one and measure 10

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,240
and these are the numbers according to

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,479
how a musician would think of them okay

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,560
we can go and plot them and by default

35
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,280
it creates sign we usually call a piano

36
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,759
roll because it kind of looks like how

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,119
if you're going to punch the rolls um

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,039
outside of things like this um you can

39
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,200
go ahead if you know map plot lib or

40
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,000
another plotting software in cre these

41
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,759
things on your own but there's a couple

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,039
things that music 21 will take care of

43
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:12,920
for you if I zoom in oh there it goes

44
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,920
oops um and some of

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,879
them but there are some things that

46
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:22,519
music 21 will take care of for you for

47
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,840
instance uh the pitch will have octave

48
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,480
marks just on the C's or wherever

49
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,239
something is it will have correct flat

50
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,680
signs or sharp signs and choose the

51
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,800
right accident for what's happening here

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,599
and things will be plotted by measure

53
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:41,720
even if uh the measures are difficult to

54
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,200
deal with for instance uh here's a

55
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,319
here's a little example where we use

56
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,440
some pretty weird

57
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,920
accidentals the only C really is a dble

58
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,959
flat or so on and it will put out you

59
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,440
can barely see it but it will put double

60
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,200
flat there and if your measures are

61
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,080
different lengths it'll do it so it's

62
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,680
probably a decent thing to go go ahead

63
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,720
and call the Misa 21 plot if you want to

64
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,720
visualize

65
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,319
something we can load on another piece

66
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:14,680
uh this is uh Arnold schernberg uh early

67
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,760
late 19th and early 20th Century

68
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,760
composer from Austria who is uh

69
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,280
considered one of the creators of a

70
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,200
total music it will load his piano piece

71
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,920
opus 19 and will load movement too this

72
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,840
is just another way of loading a

73
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,360
specific movement for a piece and we'll

74
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,280
excerpt measures 1 through 4 and show

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,599
them there's a couple little problems

76
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:42,439
here you can kind of see this piece um a

77
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,799
lot of bum bum bum bum bum bumps in it

78
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:47,239
and what we can do is in the plot

79
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,280
command we can give it other things so

80
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,040
we're going to do a scatter plot we're

81
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,480
going to map quarter length to pitch and

82
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,200
we'll give it a title see the G and the

83
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,280
B and if we zoom in

84
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,720
here we can really

85
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,760
see oh yeah um we're doing a scatter

86
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,760
plot and we're making it darker the more

87
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,599
times things appear and we can see the

88
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,360
quarter length log two um so they're

89
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,680
equally spaced between 16th notes eighth

90
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,600
notes quarter and half note and see the

91
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,600
various pitches

92
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:28,120
here the other thing we can do is we can

93
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,960
do a histogram of uh pit of octaves and

94
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,759
we'll hide little ticks for anything

95
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:38,479
that doesn't appear and put the number

96
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:42,600
of pitches here and we can really see

97
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:45,080
these two uh the G and the B showing up

98
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,160
a lot or we can just restrict it to

99
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:50,360
specific pitch classes and see the pitch

100
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,600
classes of g&b without the octaves still

101
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,479
dominate on this

102
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,680
piece uh you don't really need to

103
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:01,880
install Matt plot web anymore um because

104
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,720
it's now included music 21 but you will

105
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,880
want if you're using

106
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,240
um if you're using Jupiter notebooks to

107
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,080
put this magic command at the beginning

108
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,240
and that will uh allow you to view

109
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,240
everything in

110
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,720
line you can go ahead and see what kinds

111
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:23,759
of things are there um horizontal

112
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,639
bars we can plot measure number and

113
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:31,400
quarter length against the pitch and so

114
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:34,280
on um various pitches SC Scatter

115
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:38,280
Plots counts of how often various pitch

116
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,039
and note lengths appear we can uh we'll

117
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,720
say how this happens later but we can

118
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,560
look at uh what the range of the piece

119
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,919
is how big it how far apart it is

120
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,319
various places or what the keys that are

121
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,919
being detected in various parts of the

122
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:57,039
piece using Carol Kel Shucker's key

123
00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:00,080
analysis um we can look at when various

124
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:03,360
parts are playing and I believe this is

125
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,160
how loud they are um some silly 3D

126
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:11,400
graphs which can be kind of helpful

127
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,880
maybe uh but maybe not and it can also

128
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,599
plot against Dynamics and you'll kind of

129
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,880
notice that it says met Forte Forte

130
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:23,759
Forte pianos sportando fortisimo so that

131
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,479
there's built in um places for various

132
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,080
Dynamics we can see what kinds of Atlas

133
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,560
qualities there are and so on so what we

134
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,639
can do is we can look at how various

135
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,639
composers such as Robert Schuman a mid

136
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,919
19th Century composer how he uses his

137
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,280
pitches in a particular um string

138
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,360
quartet versus how chopan uses his in

139
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,599
one

140
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,400
Missoura then always important to go

141
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,280
back sorry it's all distorted for the

142
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,720
video but uh and look at how the piece

143
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,720
actually

144
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,560
works in chapter 44 of the music 21 you

145
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,639
this guide completely optional it'll

146
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:07,720
tell you a little bit more on how you

147
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,639
can customize plots with their title

148
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,960
change the size of the

149
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:17,520
figures change

150
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:20,000
colors and uh go ahead and um make other

151
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,720
plots highlight particular

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,160
data and um

153
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,160
remove data substitute other things in

154
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,160
there

155
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,879
not too much else these are pretty

156
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:38,919
Advanced things going on but um we can

157
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:40,400
look at offset versus cardinality well

158
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:44,000
you know what cardinality is now how

159
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,479
many pitches are sounding at once notice

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,840
this a little nice pickup measures at

161
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,000
the

162
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:55,520
beginning and um maybe you want to plot

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,120
how the frequency in hertz goes against

164
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:03,039
pitches but show um white and black keys

165
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:07,000
or this case red and black keys over

166
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:09,159
tie and you can use this to make um some

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,520
various other graphs that might not come

168
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:14,319
from data these are all kind of

169
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,319
interesting things uh smoothing out how

170
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,479
box motion Works in a particular

171
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:22,919
Crow there's a lot still to be done with

172
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,520
plotting but this is a great way to

173
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:29,240
start I'm also going to put in a link to

174
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,599
Edward Tufts or tufty I'm not exactly

175
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,200
sure visual display of quantitative

176
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:37,360
information which is a book that has

177
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:40,919
absolutely shaped how I think of what

178
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,880
are good ways of creating graphs why we

179
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,959
want to create graphs and how do we make

180
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,600
the data stand out and still be

181
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:52,000
beautiful thanks a lot for listening and

182
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,000
hope to see some beautiful graphs in the

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
future
