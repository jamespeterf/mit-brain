1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,839
And I'm now very much looking forward to

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,880
the closing remarks of this wonderful

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,280
first conference day. And therefore I

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,040
would like to invite another guest to

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,000
join us here on stage. He's the chief

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,160
executive officer at Advantage Austria.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,890
So please join me in welcoming Mikail

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:29,699
Ot.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:29,699
[Music]

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,239
Okay.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,399
Well, ladies and gentlemen, um just a

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,239
few thoughts from my side before um we

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,600
close the conference today. Um and to

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,360
thank you all for coming.

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,879
Um it was for me it was a tremendous day

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,360
and I hope it was also for you. It was

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,680
just amazing day and we get very

18
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:52,480
inspired. Um first of all number one

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,079
thought um well having listened to most

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,399
of the presentation but of most uh

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,480
having also talked to most of you during

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,239
in the breaks I thought well we are not

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,239
in the we we spoke about the future of

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,320
manufacturing but we are not at the edge

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,479
of this transformation. We all in the

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,960
middle of it and we shape it to to bring

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,040
back the initial uh discussions we had.

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,240
We all shape this transformation. And

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,040
here comes the paradox zone. While um

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,000
while the machines and the algorithms um

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,320
are learning very fast are evolving on a

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,119
daily basis and they are adapting uh

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,600
well hourly probably one of the most

34
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,000
important factors in this transformation

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,560
is probably has probably less momentum

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,640
but is probably way more important in

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,799
this transformation is us. It's the

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,159
human factor and it's about people and

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,200
actually Randall this is what you said

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,759
in 2010 or 11 here on this stage it's

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,640
all about people. So for thought number

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,840
one um we are shaping this

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,880
transformation um across disciplines um

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,560
across uh the labs uh probably also

45
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,079
across and hopefully also across borders

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,759
and across generations. Thought number

47
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,200
two and this was interesting because I

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,280
think we didn't come here to admire

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,040
technology. None of us came here to

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,479
admire technology. And it's easy to be

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,800
dazzled by um by quantum technology, by

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,920
AI, by Gen AI solutions, by all this

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,599
amazing um um progress we heard from

54
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:24,440
faculty members today.

55
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:26,800
Um but when you think about it um when

56
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,560
you ask yourself the question and when

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,360
you talk to you in the in the break the

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,760
real questions most of us asked ourel

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,040
how is this

60
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,200
technology how can this technology

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,400
adoption serve the people how can we

62
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,160
find more important how can we find the

63
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,000
framework so our people our societies

64
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,680
our generation can follow the

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,440
technologies and not you know go into uh

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,160
left and right in political systems. We

67
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,239
talked about the geopolitical change. Um

68
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,920
so this is probably uh one of the more

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,000
question how can we sca scale the

70
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,360
technology not only in the labs

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,519
sometimes it's easy in the lab you know

72
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,159
the prototype is always easy but how can

73
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,599
we scale these innovations in the in the

74
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,519
factory floor in the classrooms and in

75
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,080
societies. This is even the more

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:16,239
important question and the answer um was

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,040
probably at least for me the most

78
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,760
powerful shift we explored today wasn't

79
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,239
the technological shift. It was this

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,680
cultural framework we spoke about. It

81
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,760
was how about

82
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,440
um having our the people follow the

83
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,560
technology using the technology and

84
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,239
serving um us. And this brings me to my

85
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,560
third thought, a little bit of

86
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,040
counterbalance maybe to Professor Pa

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,400
because I think it's a it's a posit it's

88
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,640
it's a little bit of a positive vision

89
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,200
for Europe, for Austrian for Austria and

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,640
especially for Austrian companies. Um,

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,200
and I'm thinking about this cultural

92
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,239
change and this cultural transformation

93
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,400
um because I think it would be a chance

94
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,319
for us for our companies not by being

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,920
the

96
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:03,040
loudest but even most trustful in this

97
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,040
transformation. Not by being the most

98
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,439
scalable. Well, we have a lot of medium

99
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,400
medium-sized companies, but with

100
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,159
in-depth expertise again with long-term

101
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,720
relations, with quality products, with

102
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,880
trust and I have to mention it again.

103
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,320
And I think this could be very decisive

104
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,840
factors and this could be our chance.

105
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,680
The chance of Europe, the chance of also

106
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,960
the chance of our companies um to help a

107
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,120
little bit, how would I say uh to help a

108
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,000
little bit in a world searching for

109
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,080
stability and meaning probably in a

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,720
world craving for stability and meaning.

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,240
So to conclude when we all go home, just

112
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,160
uh one last um thought, let's not just

113
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,919
be inspired, let's be activated. Let's

114
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,479
go all home to our factories to our

115
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,240
research institutes to Massachusetts in

116
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,600
our places in our countries around

117
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,639
Austria. We have some guests also from

118
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,639
international companies with one um

119
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,199
message in mind. The

120
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,800
future is not something um we inherited

121
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,080
from our parents, from our mothers and

122
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,919
fathers, from our grandfathers and

123
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,479
grandmothers.

124
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,120
The future is something we built for our

125
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,720
children and for our

126
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:19,280
grandchildren. Piece by piece, thought

127
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,280
by thought, and idea by idea.
