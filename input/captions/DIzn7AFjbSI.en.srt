1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,880
so I will get right to it so Kart is one

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,280
of the most exciting stories in the last

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,440
decade in what happened to the cancer

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,480
therapy what it is is that you utilize

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,160
the patient's own immune cell te- cell

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,720
to be specific you harvest them from the

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,400
patient you genetically engineer them

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,599
and rein and and culture expand them and

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,239
then re inject that cell back into the

10
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:35,200
patient and mirac ously they go after

11
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:39,800
the patient cancer cell and kills them

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,120
now this is a highly expensive therapy

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,120
the single dose of this is roughly

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,320
speaking about half million dollar very

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,640
expensive but if you can cure the late

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,960
stage uncurable metastatic blood cancer

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,680
with this thing it works every single

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,719
penny of it

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:03,199
however uh the problem here is that this

20
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:06,720
is utilizing patient own can own te-

21
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,960
cell so because of that you know your

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,040
own te- cell is different from somebody

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,920
else's t- cell there is a huge variation

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,520
comes from the Doner of the cell as well

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,079
as the manufacturing processes so you

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,360
know to highlight

27
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:26,320
that here we bought a manufactured you

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,119
know car cells from the commercial

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,280
sources and tested how good they are you

30
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,159
know by testing it you know their you

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,399
know measuring their ability to kill the

32
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,640
cancer cell which is called The Killing

33
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,040
essay I'm not going to get into the

34
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,880
details of it what you can clearly see

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,320
is that even though all of these cells

36
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,719
are coming from the same manufacturer

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,119
and manufactur with the same protocol

38
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,759
it's all over the place some of them are

39
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,479
much better at killing cancer cell some

40
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,840
of them are really not it not good at so

41
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,759
this is a problem this is a problem not

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,320
just for the buyer of this expensive

43
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,680
therapy but also a big problem for the

44
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,879
seller and to me it is very similar

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,560
challenges that you know situation where

46
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,959
you walk into the grocery store and

47
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,720
you're not you're buying $5 watermelon

48
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,000
it's not a half million but $5

49
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,280
watermelon but still same problem we

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,519
know we have a product variation some of

51
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,080
them are more delicious than the other I

52
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:29,440
don't want to buy poor watermelon but

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,599
one thing that you're not allowed to do

54
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,160
is e them okay so you need to somehow

55
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:37,640
figure out what is the better product

56
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,280
than the other and what do you do you

57
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,400
just tap on them okay you somehow

58
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,959
without disrupting the

59
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,120
cell uh you know try to figure out the

60
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:51,480
phenotype of the cell or quality of the

61
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,760
cell and one thing you cannot do is that

62
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,280
you know traditionally the biologist try

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,159
to do this by doing what we call as a

64
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,800
omix study but then none of them would

65
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,040
be useful because you're going to end up

66
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,440
breaking up the cell you analyze the

67
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,920
genetic markup and proteomics and

68
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,000
everything but okay you knew that that

69
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,599
cell we just killed was a great t- cell

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,519
but then what's the point if the cells

71
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,879
are gone so this is a very interesting

72
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,000
Challenge and I think this is where you

73
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,879
know some of the new ideas coming from

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,360
the micro fluidics can be utilized and

75
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:29,799
there are a lot of ways to do the

76
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,799
critical quality attribute essay and

77
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,400
utilizing not the biochemical marker but

78
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,439
biophysical marker so let me tell you

79
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,280
how we approach this problem it's

80
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:44,560
essentially the same idea of actually

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,720
tapping the watermelon but because we

82
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,560
are talking about millions of te cell

83
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,599
that we need to qualify we cannot really

84
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,879
use our hand we actually use the

85
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,760
microfluidic devices so this is our way

86
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,920
of tapping the cells and te- cells so

87
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,959
this is a very specific iic microfluidic

88
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,680
devices where we actually bring in and

89
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,079
then you see the left hand side is all

90
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,239
the red blood cells but the on the right

91
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,040
panel we are actually designing the

92
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,120
pathway for these cells to be interact

93
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,000
with the obstacles in a very specific

94
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,799
Manner and this can be done in less than

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,120
10 minutes with a very small volume of

96
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:28,560
raw material and what we are trying to

97
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,840
do here is having these cell to interact

98
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,080
with these specifically designed pillars

99
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,759
and as a result of that interaction some

100
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,880
cells are ending up one location

101
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,080
Downstream then the other so if you have

102
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,680
a very rigid T Cell then you may end up

103
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,840
in certain location Downstream and then

104
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,880
the other so what you end up doing is

105
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,759
that at the downstream of all of these

106
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:56,080
devices we

107
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,600
locate where the cells end up and then

108
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,759
uh we have been using this as a way to

109
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,639
analyze these immune cells for many

110
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,160
different application maybe even immune

111
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,880
profiling and and diabetes and many

112
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,520
other today I'm going to just focus on

113
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:17,479
the cell therapy quality control so the

114
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:21,000
way we do is actually here this device

115
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:23,280
is really we have this uh obstacle array

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,759
or pin bur machine if you think about it

117
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,680
and you bring in the cell and then we

118
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,080
distribute the cell based on their

119
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,120
mechanical property or size were

120
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,800
combined and we started doing this work

121
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,280
in early 2020 we have a lab based system

122
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,199
and it's you know requiring grass

123
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,680
student and postto now after four five

124
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,720
years now we actually drisk this into a

125
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,639
building a fully integrated and and

126
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,319
portable systems in a manner that we can

127
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,199
actually now send this machine to

128
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,680
hospitals and you know nurses can

129
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,120
operate this thing in the hospital

130
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,240
sometimes in ICU in a very restrictive

131
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,840
environment so I think we actually gone

132
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,840
a long distance to make this thing

133
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,000
really

134
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Deployable and the way we understand or

135
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,039
utilize these essays is quite

136
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,639
interesting you know just like we tap

137
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:20,199
the watermelon you know there is

138
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,919
no way but so some people are better at

139
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,280
figuring out which watermelons are

140
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,759
better than the other so essentially

141
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,800
what we are doing is sort of collect all

142
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,479
the data set you know after we pass

143
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,680
these cells through these obstacle

144
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,280
courses and we have a distribution and

145
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,720
we take that distribution for number of

146
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,360
different conditions a faster flow

147
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,880
slower sped we flow slower flow speed

148
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,120
and then we also change the structure so

149
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,560
we get a number of different

150
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,680
distributions and each distribution

151
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,120
reflects the mechanical property of

152
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,039
these cell

153
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:03,759
population so we generate these uh

154
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:05,639
vectors H1 H2 H3 H4 and as a

155
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,800
distribution of the cell at the end of

156
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,800
the essay and then we take this

157
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
distribution and you look at this

158
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,360
distribution and distribution has a lot

159
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,520
of interesting information hidden in

160
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,199
there so just like we typically do in

161
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,039
any type of machine learning

162
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:27,639
architecture we vectorize them we comute

163
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:29,720
them into some Matrix and we can design

164
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,520
many many many metrics you know more

165
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,520
than hundreds of them and you feed that

166
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,520
metric into a typical clustering

167
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,240
algorithm there are lot of different

168
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,240
ways of doing it and then try to

169
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,520
correlate that metric with the important

170
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,440
actionable outcome whether the cells are

171
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,080
dead whether the cells are activated

172
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,039
whether the cells are exhausted so

173
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,680
they're not really killing the cancer

174
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,960
cell anymore there are a lot of

175
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,039
interesting and important functional

176
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,560
outcomes that we want to predict using

177
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,080
this kind of

178
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,960
techniques

179
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,919
so so the very first thing we did is

180
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,120
actually correlating you know our data

181
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:17,440
set with you know most basic phenotype

182
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,639
whether the cells are healthy and or

183
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,879
whether they are activated or ready to

184
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,960
be actually start killing the cancer

185
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:27,520
cell or whe they are just came out of

186
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,759
the Frozen bile and they are not ready

187
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,599
and they are kind of you know kind of

188
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,080
half de and they need some more time to

189
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,680
recover so you see those are really

190
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,680
relevant phenotype that is

191
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,320
really you useful in the context of

192
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,880
delivering this C therapy and you can

193
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,480
see if you look at the histogram it is

194
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,800
very clear that depending on the

195
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,200
phenotype you can actually see vastly

196
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,640
different distribution so you know that

197
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,160
we can correlate these

198
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,600
complicated histograms with the

199
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,800
important phenotype that we have are

200
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,680
caring about so we went

201
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,640
further and really thinking about using

202
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,000
this as a way to monitor the car T cell

203
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,519
production process themselves and

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,640
typically these cells are harvested from

205
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:19,560
the cancer patient and then send out to

206
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,680
some manufacturing site and they undergo

207
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:26,720
14-day culture protocol during that

208
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:30,160
14-day the cell transforms itself into a

209
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,519
fully activated cart and during that

210
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,880
transformation processes they actually

211
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,480
change the morphology they change the

212
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,880
shape they change the distribution a lot

213
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,959
of things changes as you can see in the

214
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,160
images and we can see that without

215
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,519
actually doing the manual Imaging or

216
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,440
facts or all of these standard

217
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,760
biochemical essay a 10-minute pass

218
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,800
through our device will generate this

219
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,079
histogram which can be correlated with

220
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,800
this important transformation that is

221
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:03,680
happening to this very expensive product

222
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,640
so that's the kind of a value

223
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,000
proposition we are

224
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:12,079
proposing now after that we also think

225
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,320
of this as a release essay meaning that

226
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,160
before we sending this out to the

227
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,000
patient and before injecting this ctis

228
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,640
cell into the patient which is a really

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,720
a dire

230
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,560
situation is there is a need to make

231
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,320
sure that this product has been properly

232
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:34,519
manufactured and functional and ready to

233
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:38,120
go so here we are comparing these two

234
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:41,200
kind of a bioreactor systems people use

235
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:44,000
to generate uh kti product and and these

236
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,040
are all coming from the same donor and

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,160
you can see that these two different

238
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,480
Biore reactors systems is generating

239
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:55,040
vastly different product quality and

240
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,399
this was actually very obvious from our

241
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,560
biophysical markers and we certainly do

242
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,200
not understand all the nitty-gritty

243
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,839
molecular mechanism of it but telling

244
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,639
the difference in quality in itself

245
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,959
without knowing the mechanism is already

246
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,560
enough and actionable so that you can

247
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,680
decide what to do okay this is a good

248
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,480
product or not so good product or at

249
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,880
least repeatable produced product so

250
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,720
that's the goal

251
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:27,639
here and again uh we also see that these

252
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:30,079
two bio reactors are producing Better or

253
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:32,680
Worse product and both are functional

254
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,880
but then some bioreactors are generating

255
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,519
more functional product than the other

256
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,480
and we can monitor that quality

257
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,680
valuation coming from manufacturing

258
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,680
process using this

259
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,040
essay and then finally uh remember that

260
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,360
in the first slide I talked about the

261
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,839
killing essay and this is the ultimate

262
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,240
Way of quantifying how good the cells

263
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,839
are you know just take the cell and

264
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,880
challenge them with the actual cancer

265
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,519
cell and how good they are in terms of

266
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,920
killing the cancer cell now this is the

267
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:10,399
really a very laborious requiring armies

268
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,199
of grass student to do it so in the

269
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,279
current cart manufacturing and

270
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:18,600
administration process we cannot do that

271
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,120
you know these killing essay is not done

272
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,360
right now the K cells are blindly

273
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,920
injected you know without doing any kind

274
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,720
of a quality essay but then you know if

275
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,079
you look at the biophysical ESS

276
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,639
say that we

277
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:38,800
generate so those indexes we we generate

278
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:41,920
from these hundreds of uh features is

279
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,760
very strongly correlated with what we

280
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:49,279
can recover from these Robious killing

281
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,480
essay that we do manually so what we are

282
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,680
seeing here is a prospects of doing this

283
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,920
rapid uh quality functional quality

284
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,760
essay without actually going through all

285
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,480
these lab based in know Robious killing

286
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,240
assay so this is a very strong uh value

287
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,720
proposition what that means is that

288
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,399
before injecting these c t half million

289
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,800
dollar sales into the patient we have a

290
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,320
mean in 10 minute to make sure that this

291
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,800
is a good product to go and this is a

292
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,120
very important thing to have even for

293
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,079
the sellers of this product because it's

294
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:28,440
so expensive and so high

295
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:31,240
stake so that's all I have to say today

296
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,600
and I like like to show up the photo of

297
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:38,000
the person who is mostly responsible for

298
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,440
this great work Dr CN Jang is the main

299
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,920
person behind this work he's the

300
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,760
inventor of this technology he's

301
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,519
actually trying to commercialize this

302
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,800
technology for a lot of this application

303
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,079
and there are a lot of other people

304
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,240
helped out to make this thing happen and

305
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,959
the funding came from Singapore

306
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,360
government supporting these smart Center

307
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:58,470
research and I would be happy to answer

308
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,519
any questions

309
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:04,079
[Applause]

310
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,920
thank you very much Jay for this

311
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,079
interesting presentation I I love your

312
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,279
comparison of your essay with melon

313
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:14,800
tapping uh makes it very clear um I

314
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:16,160
noticed um I'm not sure if I saw it

315
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,160
correctly but you're directly working

316
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,519
with hospitals and I was wondering if

317
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,959
you provide VSA directly to the

318
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,079
hospitals or if you involve companies

319
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:29,480
which actually build an instrument

320
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,680
around your essay and then give it to

321
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:36,079
hospitals so right now we are doing uh

322
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:39,519
several clinical trials not really

323
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:43,279
necess you know related to the KT but

324
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,880
then more in the direction of profiling

325
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,480
immune state of the patient and this is

326
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,759
very important for things like sepsis or

327
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,800
even for for the kti patient one of the

328
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,320
big side effect is what we call as a

329
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,040
cyoc kind release syndrome which is sort

330
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,440
of same thing as a sepsis so understand

331
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,800
ending these kind of sudden changes in

332
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,759
immune system is very very critical but

333
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,880
it's not done currently so most of the

334
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,720
hospital engagement we have been doing

335
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:16,160
is actually deploying these kind of

336
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,920
portable you know point of care system

337
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,800
in ICU like environment and still do

338
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,880
this quick and rapid and almost real

339
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,600
time immune profiling to generate some

340
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,720
actionable information and we are

341
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,519
getting a lot of exciting

342
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:37,560
uh data you know maybe we can see that

343
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,920
oncoming CRS onset like you know half

344
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,079
day earlier than any other essay or

345
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,040
maybe you see start seeing a sudden rise

346
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:48,600
in temperature so we we are seeing a lot

347
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,199
of exciting o datas out of this hosp

348
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,440
Hospital deployment

349
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,160
yeah any other questions thank you so

350
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,639
much Professor Han so this is outside my

351
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,600
area my question is naive but in

352
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,079
addition to the physical properties of

353
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,680
the te- cells are there opportunities to

354
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:07,560
look at for example the magnetic

355
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,800
properties of te- cells stimulation of

356
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,560
them using magnetic field Quantum and

357
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,440
try to get more separation there what

358
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,079
are the other important properties with

359
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:21,120
respect that that's a good point I think

360
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:24,920
it's a really uh untapped and underst

361
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,600
studied areas of biology and we always

362
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,440
think of cells and and molecules it's

363
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,839
just a biochemical

364
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,759
angle right but then cells are actual

365
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,360
physical object and their mechanical

366
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:41,040
structure or de ability is actually a

367
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,360
big part of their function so I I do

368
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,199
believe that there are a lot of

369
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,600
opportunities out there to both measure

370
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:53,240
and and per perur these biological

371
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,240
systems physically yeah it's a good

372
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,120
point any other questions

373
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,880
sorry hi thank you very much for

374
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,199
interesting presentation so quick

375
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,199
question for the bio physics signature

376
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,600
for that so you mentioned that most of

377
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,199
your work done is a more c um uh

378
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,240
evaluations do you have any idea like

379
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,199
how can translate the

380
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,799
biophysical um signature towards

381
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,160
different immune cells or different type

382
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,760
of cells that was a kind of really

383
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,959
robust or you need to build a new model

384
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,960
to assess that the other type of cells

385
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:34,360
yes thank you uh so our CTI work has not

386
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,880
yet published it's under review right

387
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:40,039
now but we already published using this

388
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,160
for the whole blood okay and then as you

389
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:46,160
can see this device will immediately get

390
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:49,400
rid of the rbcs and just collect the WBC

391
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,720
component and then subject to this essay

392
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,360
so we have already published on using

393
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,080
this for evaluating an emergency

394
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,360
department patient who works into the

395
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,240
emergency department of the hospital

396
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,360
and many of them are not sick actually

397
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,880
they are maybe traumatized or something

398
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:10,240
and very few subset of them may have a

399
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,120
blood infection and finding that people

400
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,600
which is at the onset of systematic

401
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,960
inflammation is critically important and

402
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,440
I think we already have done a lot of

403
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,440
work and a much more

404
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,400
expanded uh clinical trial is ongoing in

405
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,400
Singapore

406
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:33,559
yeah any more questions s if not we'll

407
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,640
stop here and go into a networking break

408
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:37,480
and then we'll be back at noon for the

409
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,000
second part of the session so thanks

410
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,000
again professor H for a very interesting

411
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
presentation
