1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,559
Today

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,240
today we're going to talk about

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:21,920
stochcastic processes uh the second set

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,840
of lectures and we're going to begin

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,599
with a discussion of brownie in motion.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,640
Uh, brownie in motion is a process that

7
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,200
I'm sure most of you have heard of. And

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,000
it was named after Robert Brown, an

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,399
English botonist. And this is an

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,640
interesting case where a scientist

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,600
observes some dynamics in nature and

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,039
then is concerned about what

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,600
mathematical model uh might describe

14
00:00:51,039 --> 00:01:00,399
that behavior. Turns out that it was I

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,960
guess Albert Einstein who uh formalized

16
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,640
this brownie in motion model

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,960
mathematically

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:13,360
and Norbert Weiner, our MIT uh hero. Uh

19
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,280
those of you familiar with the math

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,439
department know about the Norbert Weiner

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,360
uh room that we have. and he developed

22
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,280
the mathematical foundation for Brownie

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:29,439
in motion. Now let's take a look at a

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,159
simulation of Brownie in motion in two

25
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:36,479
dimensions. So this is the kind of

26
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:41,200
dynamics that Brown was observing. And

27
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:44,479
so in these slides, we're going to start

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,040
the process at the origin of the space

29
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,640
where the red dot is and then move

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,159
around in two dimensions where each step

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:59,439
is a random move in the x direction and

32
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:02,640
a random move in the y direction. And

33
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:07,119
for this simulation uh we use Gaussian

34
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:12,400
uh distributions. But as I page through

35
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:14,959
these graphs, one can see how a particle

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,360
moving according to these dynamics will

37
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,520
start at the origin and evolve to the

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,440
final red dot.

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,560
And if we hold down

40
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:31,120
the graphs and see where it goes, you

41
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:34,959
can see that basically there's

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:39,040
purely random dynamics. but um of a very

43
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:44,400
special kind. And so uh the special kind

44
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:47,680
is that the movements are jagged

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,200
and uh unpredictable in terms of their

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,879
direction.

47
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,000
Something that's really quite

48
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,959
interesting when you just look at this

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,959
and page through the dynamics here sort

50
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:05,440
of animating the process. The movements

51
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:10,239
in fact have no uh trend in them to move

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,159
left or up or down. And so the movements

53
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,760
we see

54
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,879
uh basically are movements that are

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,120
symmetrical in their dynamics.

56
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,760
And so that's a very interesting

57
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,000
property that we would like to uh

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,560
characterize mathematically.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,599
So let's look at how we define Brownian

60
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,959
motion in one dimension.

61
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,799
So in one dimension we are simply

62
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:44,760
looking at

63
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,760
a graph. Let me find the eraser here.

64
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Okay.

65
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:04,480
In one dimension we have time t. And

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,640
we're going to think of a process BT

67
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,040
um which will start at zero and then

68
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:16,320
it's going to evolve

69
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:21,440
over time in such a way that

70
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:24,800
the increments of the process from t to

71
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,560
t plus delta t. So if we have t and t

72
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,080
plus delta t here and we look at b of t

73
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,040
here

74
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,040
and b of t plus deltat t,

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,840
this vertical increment is going to be

76
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,560
normally distributed

77
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,639
for any increment of time delta t. And

78
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,320
the normal distribution for the

79
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:55,840
magnitude of that increment will be a

80
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,520
normal random variable with mean zero

81
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,280
and a variance that is proportional to

82
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,400
the length of the interval. So as we

83
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,560
consider increments delta t that are

84
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,800
larger, we'll have greater variation in

85
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,560
the vertical increment that's normally

86
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,160
distributed. Now in addition to normal

87
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:24,080
increments we have independent

88
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,560
disjoint increments. So if we have

89
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:33,560
different time points

90
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,560
like t1, t2 and then t3, t4

91
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,800
if these increments are separate or

92
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:44,560
disjoint from each other then the change

93
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,840
from t1 to t2 and the change from t3 to

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,840
t4 those will be independent random

95
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,880
variables.

96
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:58,000
Finally, uh, B of T turns out to be a

97
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:02,479
continuous function of time if it

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,639
satisfies these properties. And so this

99
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,319
is a very

100
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,199
simple model in terms of a continuous

101
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:15,680
time stochcastic process.

102
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:21,680
Now uh the properties of Brownian motion

103
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:26,240
and we are that um it's a marov process.

104
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:30,319
So if we're looking at the value

105
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,080
at b of t plus delta t at this time

106
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,440
point

107
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:39,759
um that is equal to the value at any

108
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,440
prior time point well at b of t plus the

109
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,560
increment.

110
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,520
And so given the information set up to

111
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,280
time little t, the conditional

112
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,240
distribution

113
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:56,080
simply um is

114
00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:00,080
equal to that starting point b of t plus

115
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:03,680
the random increment. So displacements

116
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:08,360
uh are independent of the past apart

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,360
from the last value of the past.

118
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:17,680
Okay. mean and variance of B of T. Well,

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,599
because the increments are normally

120
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:26,000
distributed with mean zero, then the

121
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:29,680
expected value of B of T into the future

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,800
will stay at zero, but the variance of B

123
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:38,319
of T will increase with time. And so the

124
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,759
standard deviation of b of t will be

125
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:46,319
proportional or will be sigma times the

126
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,720
square root of t. So if we think of

127
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,680
drawing curves

128
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,039
which correspond to sigma square root of

129
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,879
t this corresponds to one standard

130
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,879
deviation above the zero mean for the

131
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,879
process.

132
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,759
Okay. The covariance function of

133
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,759
Brownian motion. If we want to look at

134
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:15,120
the co-variance between two times s and

135
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,400
t. So suppose here is time s and here is

136
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,800
time t. Then

137
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,800
the process

138
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,520
paths

139
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,840
to time t include the process paths up

140
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,360
to time s but then have this independent

141
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,240
increment beyond time s. And so when we

142
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,000
look at the co-variance

143
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,560
of the process at times s and t, it's

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,120
equal to the expected value of the

145
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,680
product. But we can split B of T into B

146
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,519
of S plus the increment and we simply

147
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,240
get sigma^ 2 S for the co-variance. So

148
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,000
the degree to which the process is

149
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,640
correlated with other values of the

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,880
process it depends on how much overlap

151
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,399
there is in the time intervals uh

152
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:16,320
corresponding to those two values.

153
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:18,640
Now this process that starts at

154
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,800
zero

155
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,279
B of 0

156
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:29,519
or B sub0 or B of 0 equal to zero. We

157
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,839
could start it at any other level and

158
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,240
have a process that has similar

159
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,000
properties but just has a different mean

160
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:41,279
level from time zero. So we can talk

161
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,480
about starting the Brownian motion at

162
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,600
any given point.

163
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,760
And so uh in order to work with these

164
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:55,839
models um we'll find it convenient to

165
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,839
introduce the notation for normal random

166
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:03,279
variables.

167
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:05,760
And so if we have Z be a standard normal

168
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:10,480
that is a normal distribution with mean

169
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:14,800
zero and standard deviation one then the

170
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,600
probability density function is given by

171
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,000
this formula. I'm sure everyone is

172
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,480
comfortable with that. And the

173
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,399
cumulative distribution function is

174
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:30,640
simply the integral of the density from

175
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,920
minus infinity up to C for f of c. And

176
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,200
this notation of smallcase f and

177
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,079
uppercase v are standard for referring

178
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,399
to gaussian or normal densities and

179
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,399
cdfs.

180
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:50,399
Well, if we have a normal with non-mean

181
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:55,120
nonzero mean meu and variance to squar

182
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:59,120
or standard deviation toao, then we have

183
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:04,160
uh the density of this normal

184
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:07,040
y is a simple function of the density of

185
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:10,640
the standard normal. uh we simply

186
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,440
subtract the mean mu and divide by toao

187
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:18,160
inside fee and we have a toao

188
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,920
denominator factor in front and what's

189
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,040
particularly

190
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,800
uh convenient at times is that if we

191
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,120
want to calculate the cdf

192
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,440
of y

193
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:38,079
then this cdf of y is actually the cdf

194
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:41,600
of the of under the standard normal of C

195
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:46,399
minus mu over towo.

196
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:53,279
So um we basically have you know y is

197
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:59,279
equal to mu plus uh sigma or toao

198
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:01,120
z. And so um z is equal to y minus mu

199
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:06,480
over towo. And so we're just

200
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:08,959
substituting in this equation for y in

201
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,120
terms of z.

202
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:16,480
Now uh the probability model of the

203
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,000
whole Brownian motion process

204
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,360
is

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,519
given by or we can represent it by

206
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:29,120
saying the conditional distribution of

207
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:33,120
the time t value given the time s value

208
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:37,760
is normally distributed with mean equal

209
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:42,079
to the time s value x and variance sigma

210
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:46,320
squar times the length of the increment.

211
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:48,880
So its PDF has this form.

212
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:54,079
So the notation

213
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:58,240
here is the density of y at time t given

214
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:01,440
x the value at time s.

215
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:06,399
We have this Gaussian density that's

216
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:11,360
centered at x. And the variance of y

217
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:15,680
depends on the increment from s to t

218
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:20,800
multiplied by the sigma squ.

219
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,639
Now with this probability model

220
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,519
um

221
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,279
it turns out this density function

222
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,360
satisfies the diffusion equation

223
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:36,560
and the diffusion equation is going to

224
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:39,440
arise again and again in this course um

225
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,959
especially when we get into the

226
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,839
valuation of derivatives.

227
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,040
And so

228
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:52,160
for now let's just

229
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:57,279
understand this diffusion equation. It

230
00:13:52,160 --> 00:14:01,519
says that the partial derivative of P

231
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:04,399
with respect to time T is equal to a

232
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:08,880
multiple of the second partial

233
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:13,519
derivative of P with respect to Y.

234
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,839
So this is easy to verify for s= 0 and

235
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:20,120
sigma= 1.

236
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,120
And if we look at this

237
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:31,680
set of graphs, here's the density of

238
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:34,720
x um the given uh or let's see here's

239
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,800
the essentially the density of y

240
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,920
uh represented by x. So the notation

241
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:46,160
symbol here is we're using x now instead

242
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:49,440
of y and we're considering the initial

243
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,120
value of the uh brownian motion being

244
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:57,040
zero. Um

245
00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:01,279
and if we increase time

246
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,199
then this normal density drops in the

247
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,240
middle

248
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:10,800
and it increases

249
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,920
far from the middle. And so the change

250
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:18,399
in the density

251
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:21,040
is negative near the middle

252
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,720
and positive

253
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,199
outside.

254
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,360
And that's because if we look at the

255
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,199
second derivative of this density

256
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,360
function,

257
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,199
it's positive.

258
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,920
Then it's negative. For the second

259
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,880
derivative, the curvature is negative.

260
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,959
And then it switches from being a

261
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,600
negative curvature to a positive

262
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,720
curvature. And those points of

263
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,600
inflection with the normal density are

264
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,199
actually at plus and minus one standard

265
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,320
deviation.

266
00:15:53,199 --> 00:16:00,240
So if we increase the time from uh one

267
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,759
to two

268
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:09,040
to three or two and a half here you can

269
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:11,040
see how it's basically um dropping in

270
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,000
the middle of the distribution and it's

271
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,360
rising on the other side. So, so this

272
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,759
kind of motion or dynamics

273
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:25,120
um satisfies the diffusion equation

274
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,560
and uh so

275
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:33,600
what's I think important is just to have

276
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:36,959
a good sense of what it means when a

277
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:43,920
function such as the density satisfies

278
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:46,800
this uh diffusion equation. Now um

279
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:51,360
let's see this diffusion equation

280
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:54,560
relates to sort of a conservation of

281
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,320
probability for every x.

282
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:01,600
So regardless of what the sort of

283
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,920
starting value is, we have the

284
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:09,600
probability density integrating to one

285
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:11,120
always and the uh it turns out that this

286
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,000
density

287
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:18,799
is a unique solution to this diffusion

288
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,039
equation. So an important issue in the

289
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:25,039
mathematical

290
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:28,079
uh development framework for models is

291
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:31,200
our solutions to our equations. Do they

292
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,000
exist? Are they unique? In fact, for

293
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,679
this diffusion equation, we get uh a

294
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,280
unique solution satisfying uh

295
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,360
properties.

296
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:47,840
Okay. um in other disciplines well in

297
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:51,679
physics there's a heat equation in uh

298
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,919
let's see in uh the dynamics of sort of

299
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,799
populations there's the fauler plank

300
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:01,679
equation and cole mcgor forward equation

301
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:05,360
these these uh arise um outside of uh

302
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,200
mathematical brownie motion as well now

303
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,760
um

304
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,679
the interesting question

305
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,280
perhaps or at least the interesting

306
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:20,240
question to mathematicians is um how do

307
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:23,840
we really define Brownian motion a

308
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:27,280
formally as a stochastic process?

309
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:31,120
And so it turns out that brownie in

310
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,760
motion can be defined as the limiting

311
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:38,000
stochastic process

312
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:42,000
corresponding to a random walk.

313
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,240
So let's consider

314
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,160
random variables x indexed by integers

315
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,320
that are independent and identically

316
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,799
distributed.

317
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:58,720
And let's assume that those X's have

318
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:04,080
mean zero and standard deviation one.

319
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:09,600
Then if we look at the random walk with

320
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:13,600
steps X1 to Xn for the nth uh position

321
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,200
of the random walk. then the limiting

322
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,280
distribution

323
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:23,760
of the normalized random walk is

324
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:28,000
actually a standard normal distribution.

325
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,559
So um f of c is our standard normal

326
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,240
cumulative distribution function. The

327
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,400
standardized

328
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:40,880
random walk uh will the limit as n grows

329
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:44,480
large have a Gaussian distribution with

330
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:49,039
mean zero and standard deviation one.

331
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:53,760
So what we can do is consider

332
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:56,760
normalizing the random walk process

333
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,760
by

334
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,160
having

335
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:08,240
the sort of partial sums of the steps

336
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:11,440
uh divided by root n. But rather than

337
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:16,320
focusing just on those increments, those

338
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:20,960
integer increments, we consider for

339
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:24,120
times say between zero and one. uh we

340
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,120
can consider

341
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:34,880
values for time t between say integer k

342
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,960
/n and integer k / n + 1 /n to define a

343
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:45,039
continuous

344
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:49,039
path of bn of t given s of n and t.

345
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:52,799
And so what we then can do is say let's

346
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:56,480
consider the limit as the number of

347
00:20:52,799 --> 00:21:01,200
increments uh number of steps increases

348
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,679
arbitrarily let's consider the limiting

349
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,360
process and that turns out to be a

350
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:10,880
brownie in motion process.

351
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,799
So with this normalized random uh walk

352
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:18,240
process,

353
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:20,640
it turns out that this limiting

354
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,480
distribution

355
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,840
is or this limiting process is invariant

356
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,320
to the distribution of the x's.

357
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,000
So if we have random walks with

358
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,640
independent

359
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,720
steps that have mean zero, standard

360
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,320
deviation one,

361
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,120
then

362
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,240
regardless of what that distribution is,

363
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,280
the limiting normalized random walk will

364
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,720
be the diffusion process.

365
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:55,039
So let's take a look at two cases for

366
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:59,840
the steps. Bernoli X's and Gaussian X's

367
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:02,320
which of course will be uh Gaussian

368
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,799
and

369
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,039
so here

370
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,320
is a

371
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:15,120
accumulation or a random walk with with

372
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:19,760
10 steps. The top panel corresponds to

373
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:22,559
unit plus one or minus one steps and the

374
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,559
bottom panel corresponds to Gaussian

375
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,559
steps.

376
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,880
And if we increase the number of steps

377
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,039
and normalize them by dividing by root

378
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,720
t,

379
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:41,679
we end up getting these different paths

380
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,200
tracing out. And so what's important in

381
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:48,720
this display is that as we let n get

382
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,520
arbitrarily large, the process will be

383
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,480
equivalent to brownie in motion. So

384
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,120
we're going to go up to 2,000 steps

385
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,360
here.

386
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:05,760
And one can see how this normalized

387
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:10,720
random walk process evolves.

388
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:13,919
And when we get to the end of the

389
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:18,320
simulation here of 2,000 steps, this is

390
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:23,679
what we have. Um, and so the key

391
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:27,840
takeaway is that the limiting process

392
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:31,039
will be a brownie in motion

393
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,960
and it doesn't matter what the step

394
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:37,520
distribution is in the limit.

395
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,880
And so this

396
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:44,000
implies that this model may be useful in

397
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,600
a variety of contexts where underlying

398
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,840
steps of the process increments may have

399
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:55,840
some distribution that's non- Gaussian

400
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:59,520
um and but the distribution of

401
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,720
increments over long periods of time uh

402
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,600
will then follow the the diffusion.

403
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,600
So um

404
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,679
so the key properties of Brownian motion

405
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,559
are independent increments and the

406
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:18,240
variance of those increments are

407
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:20,159
proportional to the time period between

408
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:25,520
the measures.

409
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:28,559
Now there's a reflection principle

410
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,960
in working with Brownie in motion that

411
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,480
is very powerful. Um this is an example

412
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,440
where

413
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:42,720
the mathematical theory is uh

414
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,960
a bit tricky but if you're clever at

415
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:50,000
solving the problem you may find an

416
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,039
elegant simple solution to the problem.

417
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,960
So let's just understand what it means

418
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:59,440
to be reflecting Brownian motion first.

419
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:03,520
So um

420
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,400
we consider brownie in motion to be the

421
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,799
process B

422
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,799
of T.

423
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:21,600
And so this will be one realization of

424
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:24,600
the path perhaps. And then if we

425
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,600
consider

426
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:33,279
the first time the process hits x

427
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:38,720
and define toao

428
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:40,799
um equal to the first time b of t is

429
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,400
equal to x.

430
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,840
Then

431
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:49,360
okay this is the first time

432
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,840
it hits that level x.

433
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,360
If we consider

434
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,880
reflecting this path

435
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,520
about the level at time x going into the

436
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,559
future. So this would be sort of going

437
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:08,960
like this

438
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:11,200
and then up like that. Okay. This is the

439
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,919
mathematical formula for doing a

440
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:19,039
reflection of B about X.

441
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:24,159
And we'll see some examples of this

442
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:28,640
uh in a minute. But what is important

443
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:32,720
in these reflected paths is that the

444
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:36,159
probability model for the original

445
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,880
process and the reflected process those

446
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:43,200
are identical.

447
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,840
So let's take a look at this reflected

448
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,520
brownie in motion simulation. So, what

449
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:54,400
I'm doing here is simulating brownie in

450
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:58,559
motion over 10,000 steps and looking at

451
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:03,120
an original process in red and then

452
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:05,600
reflecting that in green. And because of

453
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,919
overlapping colors, I guess the

454
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:12,320
beginning process at time zero is the

455
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,960
original and the reflected path. So, it

456
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,440
appears as the reflected. So once it

457
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:21,919
hits this level X

458
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:25,360
in red, the green reflects

459
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,200
about X the value and it continues

460
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,840
reflecting

461
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:34,400
uh across the remaining path of the

462
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,600
original series.

463
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,760
Now, here's another realization

464
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,720
of reflected brownie in motion. Has the

465
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,360
same property.

466
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,600
And

467
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,919
here's a third, you know, basically with

468
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,760
different realizations of brownie in

469
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:56,240
motion, we'll get different paths. Uh,

470
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,000
and the reflected paths have these same

471
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,120
properties.

472
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,760
Now um

473
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,520
the interesting

474
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,760
question

475
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,080
is

476
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,720
um well it's actually let me go back to

477
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,880
the notes here

478
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,399
and

479
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,320
the interesting question is to ask what

480
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:25,480
is

481
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,480
the maximum of a brownie in motion

482
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,480
up to time t.

483
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,279
So we can define m of t to be what is

484
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,799
the maximum value that the brownie in

485
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,799
motion has realized between time zero

486
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,000
and t.

487
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:46,880
Well, the probability

488
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,120
of the maximum

489
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:55,279
exceeding X some level

490
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:58,320
will actually be twice the probability

491
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:02,799
that the ending value of the process

492
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:06,320
exceeds X. So let's take a look again at

493
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:09,320
the reflected paths.

494
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Um

495
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:18,000
so if we look at the reflected paths

496
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,840
about X

497
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,760
then

498
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,720
the red and the green paths

499
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,640
have the same probabilities of

500
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,200
occurring.

501
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,679
And

502
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:39,760
the uh if the let's see if the uh if we

503
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:42,960
look at whether the ending value of the

504
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:47,760
original Brownian motion

505
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:52,399
sorry or the ending value of

506
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:55,679
a Brownian motion is exceeds uh a given

507
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:59,600
level then

508
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,720
there will be twice that number twice

509
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,240
twice those realizations for which the

510
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,760
maximum exceeded that level. So for both

511
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,919
of these reflected paths the maximum

512
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,320
um let's see the maximum of the path

513
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,440
exceeded x

514
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,360
and um so

515
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:26,000
looking here

516
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:30,240
um the probability of uh

517
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,720
the maximum exceeding x. Well, we can

518
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,679
just look at

519
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:40,720
the probability of a path exceeding x at

520
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:44,240
the end point and the reflected

521
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,440
intervals will match those one for one.

522
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,520
And so we basically have the formula

523
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,600
that

524
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,679
we have

525
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:59,440
twice the final

526
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,200
value of the process exceeding X is

527
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,880
equal to the probability that the

528
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,640
maximum exceeds X. And we can write out

529
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,600
what that

530
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:13,000
probability is in terms of the standard

531
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,000
normal CDF.

532
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,440
Um now from this

533
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,279
result

534
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:27,200
we can differentiate

535
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:31,679
this probability with respect to x

536
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:36,000
and get the density

537
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:38,399
of the uh maximum

538
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,039
and um

539
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:45,200
so let's see here.

540
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:47,360
So here is a graph of the sort of

541
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,159
cumulative probability

542
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,519
of

543
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:58,159
the maximum exceeding a level x. And

544
00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:00,720
this is uh basically um we're interested

545
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:05,679
in what's the probability of exceeding x

546
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:08,720
before time t. And with lower values of

547
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:12,720
x like one, the probability is quite

548
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:16,559
high. If the uh

549
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:22,200
let's see if x is is very

550
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:22,200
let's see or sorry is that x there

551
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,399
right okay so so so the maximum level at

552
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,960
the maximum is three the probability of

553
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:34,240
exceeding three is much lower the

554
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,960
probability of exceeding two is is in

555
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,559
the midway there

556
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:44,399
um and what's also Also very interesting

557
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:50,559
is that uh we can use these results

558
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:55,200
to calculate the density function for

559
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:58,640
the first hitting time of a given level.

560
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,039
And so importantly we have the

561
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,279
probability of the max up to time t

562
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:10,399
exceeding x is twice the probability

563
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:13,919
that the ending value exceeds x.

564
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:18,559
And we can differentiate this with

565
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:22,880
respect to t and we get this density

566
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:28,559
function for the density of the stopping

567
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:32,960
time for hitting a given level uh x.

568
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,679
So let's see here if we have that. So

569
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,840
here's the hitting time densities.

570
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,840
Um

571
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,440
so with standard Brownian motion if

572
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,360
we're looking at the time to hit the

573
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,799
level one

574
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,679
starting at zero then there's this nice

575
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,480
unimodal distribution for that time

576
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,080
which is relatively short. But if we're

577
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,840
looking at hitting times for higher

578
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:03,840
levels like two or three then that

579
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:07,519
hitting time distribution spreads out.

580
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,440
So now um let's say we can talk about

581
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:14,960
some extensions

582
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:18,560
of brownie in motion. Um one is just

583
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:22,879
reflected brownie motion around zero.

584
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:27,040
So if we have the process

585
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:32,159
bouncing off zero level

586
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:36,720
um we can think of that process being a

587
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:39,839
positive stochastic process and it's

588
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,760
fairly easy to show that the expected

589
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:47,200
value of this reflected brownie in

590
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:50,320
motion is a multiple of roo<unk> t

591
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:53,200
of 2 over pi And the variance is 1 - 2

592
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,320
over pi t.

593
00:34:53,200 --> 00:35:00,800
And we can also consider absorbed

594
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,839
brownie in motion. Um if we consider

595
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:08,560
toao being the first time zero is the

596
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:15,440
level zero uh or a level x is hit then

597
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:18,960
um we can define our process being um

598
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:22,480
equal to the original brownie in motion

599
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:27,040
b of t or being zero for t greater than

600
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:30,480
toao. And so with absorbed brownie in

601
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,000
motion um these kinds of processes are

602
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,520
useful

603
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,560
for example when we have a brownie in

604
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,520
motion like process for a stock price

605
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,359
which um is generally positive so long

606
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,839
as the company is viable but if the

607
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,119
company goes bankrupt then it gets the

608
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:52,480
price gets absorbed at zero.

609
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:57,040
Now um we have

610
00:35:52,480 --> 00:36:01,680
another extension um of Brownian motion

611
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,680
which is called the Brownian bridge.

612
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,640
And so

613
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:10,160
if we consider

614
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:13,040
a Brownie in motion process starting at

615
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:16,640
zero

616
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,440
and it goes up to

617
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,160
let's say time one

618
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:26,920
starting at zero

619
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,920
um we can define

620
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:34,119
we can define the procedure

621
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,119
X

622
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,920
which is equal to B of T

623
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:49,640
uh

624
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:49,640
let's see B of T minus T B of

625
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:59,920
one let's see is that right

626
00:36:52,800 --> 00:37:02,920
minus T * B of 1 so if we consider

627
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,920
Um

628
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:15,760
let's see looking at well let's see this

629
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:20,880
process so x of 1 is equal to b of 1 - 1

630
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:24,240
* b of 1 which is equal to zero. Um if

631
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,400
we basically sort of draw

632
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,400
a line

633
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,400
to

634
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:38,560
if we consider this line as one and this

635
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:43,760
has slope B of one

636
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:47,920
then um if we subtract TB of one we're

637
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,160
looking at sort of pinning down the

638
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:55,720
brownie in motion.

639
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,720
um and looking at the distance from

640
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:04,720
sort of a constant slope t b of 1 and b

641
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:06,960
of t. And this particular uh process

642
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:11,240
actually arises

643
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,240
in a very interesting context

644
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,440
of normalized empirical distribution

645
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:21,920
functions. So

646
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:26,320
what do we want to

647
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,880
uh highlight here? If we have a sequence

648
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:33,119
of random variables

649
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:37,240
that are uniformly distributed

650
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,240
between zero and one

651
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,599
and we calculate their empirical

652
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:48,880
distribution function.

653
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:52,320
So it's the count of the u's less than

654
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,839
or equal to t / n.

655
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,320
Then

656
00:38:53,839 --> 00:39:01,520
this empirical distribution function

657
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,480
will have expectation

658
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,240
equal to

659
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:11,359
t

660
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:13,760
and variance equal to t * 1 - t / n. So

661
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,839
if we think of

662
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,920
these

663
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:21,760
u

664
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:24,400
so we have ui is distributed uniform

665
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,079
from 0 to one

666
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:32,320
we have the scale from 0 to one

667
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,320
and we consider a value ui as a

668
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,560
realization

669
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,680
then the probability that ui is less

670
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,599
than or equal to t

671
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,640
um

672
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,640
is equal to t

673
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,119
and the uh

674
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,240
variance

675
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:08,480
of the indicator of ui being less than

676
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:13,359
or equal to t. This is a Berni outcome

677
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:16,079
which has variance equal to the

678
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:20,560
probability of occurring times the

679
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:26,880
complement of that. So we get this

680
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:29,359
um t * 1 minus t being the variance of

681
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:35,440
the indicator of the ui being less than

682
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:37,920
or equal to t. And then if we

683
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,200
consider the empirical distribution

684
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,880
function which is summing over these

685
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,400
indicators

686
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:53,760
then we get

687
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:58,000
a process which has a limiting value

688
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:01,359
which is uh basically the deviation from

689
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,640
its mean times scaled up by root root n

690
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:07,119
is normal with mean 0 and variance t * 1

691
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:11,200
minus t and this is actually the

692
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:17,160
brownian bridge uh process.

693
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:17,160
Now um with the uh

694
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,920
let's see with these examples where we

695
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,800
use uniform

696
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,720
random variables and properties of

697
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:34,400
functions of those uniforms. Um

698
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,119
it's important to note that for any

699
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,119
continuous distribution

700
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:48,680
say um y

701
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,680
uh distributed with some

702
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,359
this is the cdf

703
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:58,720
of y.

704
00:41:53,359 --> 00:42:03,079
Um if we calculate

705
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,079
f of y

706
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,359
this happens to be a uniform

707
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,359
distribution.

708
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:17,520
So this is the probability integral

709
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:20,000
transform of any random variable. And so

710
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,760
when we have this property for the

711
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:27,680
empirical distribution function of

712
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:31,680
uniforms well of uniforms

713
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:36,720
um if we replace the u's which are

714
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:40,079
uniform 01 by assumption with a

715
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:44,240
distribution function f of y where we

716
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:47,760
have y1 to yn iid

717
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,599
with this uh cdf

718
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,800
f suby.

719
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:54,800
Then um

720
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,440
the u

721
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:05,000
i equal to f of yi

722
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,000
f suby of y these will be iid uniform.

723
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,560
So uh that's that's a really nice

724
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:16,720
result. Um and it leads to issues

725
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:18,319
involved with uh modeling model

726
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,839
selection.

727
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:25,680
Uh if we want to know whether a given an

728
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:28,880
assumed probability model for y's is

729
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,440
true or not, we can do this

730
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,200
transformation and test whether the

731
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,760
transformed series or transformed sample

732
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,640
is consistent with being a uniform or

733
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,880
not.

734
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:47,200
All right.

735
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:49,920
Well, um, with simple brownie in motion,

736
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:53,440
standard brownie in motion, we can

737
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:58,000
consider an extension of that to brownie

738
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:00,160
in motion with drift mu. So, we can

739
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,200
consider a drift parameter and a

740
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,800
volatility parameter.

741
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:10,640
Um and uh

742
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,880
such a process will have independent

743
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,480
increments

744
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:19,440
with variances um of differences

745
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,440
proportional to

746
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,960
the time interval between S and T.

747
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,280
And

748
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,280
we can

749
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,280
um

750
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:41,200
work with the Brownian motion with drift

751
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:42,960
um using a uh one-step analysis

752
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,880
and

753
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,200
in considering

754
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,880
this X

755
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,800
process.

756
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:57,280
So x

757
00:44:50,800 --> 00:45:00,960
is equal to t mu plus sigma b of t. So

758
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,640
this is x of t.

759
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:07,520
Um

760
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:12,079
if we look at the increment ahead deltat

761
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:15,119
t from little t then

762
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:19,760
expanding out the representation of this

763
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:22,480
brownian motion with drift we get that

764
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:28,000
it's equal to the brownian motion at

765
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:31,359
time little t plus mu deltat t plus

766
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:38,000
sigma times the increment of the brownie

767
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:39,599
motion process from t to t plus delta t.

768
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,160
And

769
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:49,680
so increments of x correspond to

770
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:53,040
increments of time plus times the drift

771
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,920
rate mu plus sigma the volatility

772
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:59,280
parameter times the increment of the

773
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:03,839
standard brownie motion.

774
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:09,359
So our process X brownie in motion with

775
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:13,440
drift will have nonzero mean

776
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:17,520
increments and increments variances that

777
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:19,760
are proportional to the change in time.

778
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,560
And this

779
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,240
increment will have an exact normal

780
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,640
distribution

781
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,280
uh with these properties.

782
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:33,920
And what's

783
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:38,640
particularly uh important is that as we

784
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:42,480
let um deltat t the length of our

785
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:48,640
increments get infinite

786
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:51,920
then the expected squared increment of x

787
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:55,440
ends up being equal to well it's exactly

788
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,160
equal to the variance of that increment

789
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,839
plus the square of the mean.

790
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:06,319
But this square of the mean

791
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:08,480
uh is a term that is small order of

792
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:13,839
deltat t.

793
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:16,319
So our expected squared increments will

794
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:19,200
be uh

795
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:23,200
to order deltat t equal to sigma squar

796
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:27,119
deltat t and then a small order of delta

797
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,720
t uh term after that. Also if we

798
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:33,040
consider

799
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,880
powers of delta x so our increments to a

800
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:39,520
power

801
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,520
then when our power c is greater than

802
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:45,119
two it's equal to two here when it's

803
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:48,560
greater than two then this will also be

804
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:52,800
of small order delta t. Now the reason

805
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:55,760
why uh we're interested in

806
00:47:52,800 --> 00:48:00,079
these properties is because

807
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:08,319
um we're going to be working ultimately

808
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:13,760
with um say a value of some derivative

809
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:19,200
that depends upon x of t.

810
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:21,119
So there's basically a uh derivative

811
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,640
value

812
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,880
which

813
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,119
depends upon

814
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,119
the uh

815
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,119
underlying

816
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:38,319
underlying uh I'll just say the

817
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:42,480
underlying asset price.

818
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:46,000
And so the dynamics of this of the

819
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,680
derivative prices

820
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:54,200
can

821
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:54,200
be written as a tailaylor series.

822
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,359
And so we'll want to be able to deal

823
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:03,359
with increments of x

824
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:08,240
and

825
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:11,599
powers of increments of x as our

826
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:14,319
valuation function uh may be expressed

827
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,880
if it has a tailaylor series

828
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:20,400
representation.

829
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,720
Okay. Um

830
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,680
all right. So so let's consider a

831
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,520
brownie the problem of uh brownie in

832
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:31,920
motion

833
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:35,200
uh underlying a gamblers's ruin problem.

834
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,760
So let's let x of t be brownie in motion

835
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:41,839
with drift

836
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:46,079
mu and variance sigma squared.

837
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:49,280
And we'll consider a level

838
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:53,960
an initial level equal to x that's

839
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,960
between two levels a and b.

840
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,920
And we want to

841
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:08,559
consider

842
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:10,079
the uh stopping time being hitting A or

843
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:14,079
B

844
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:17,040
and ask what's the probability that we

845
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:19,359
hit B first.

846
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,960
So

847
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:27,079
over time t we have

848
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,079
basically uh

849
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:35,359
levels a and b

850
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:39,680
and an initial level x at time zero

851
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:42,800
and we're interested in

852
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:47,920
hitting a or b.

853
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:51,599
So toao is equal to the hit time

854
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,079
of A or B.

855
00:50:51,599 --> 00:51:02,359
And we're interested in what's the

856
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:02,359
probability of hitting B first before A.

857
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:10,079
And um

858
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:12,800
this generalizes our uh problem in the

859
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:16,880
first lecture on stochastic process

860
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:19,920
where we had a random walk with unit

861
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:24,319
steps with drift

862
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:27,040
and um or so there was a bias of maybe a

863
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:29,040
plus one versus a minus one occurring

864
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,800
and we wanted to solve for what's the

865
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:35,119
likelihood of hitting a level B before

866
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,440
level A.

867
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:41,359
So with this

868
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:45,440
um we use an infiniteesmal one-step

869
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:49,599
analysis and this solution approach is

870
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:55,680
illustrative of how many uh problems are

871
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:59,040
solved with uh stochcastic processes.

872
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:03,440
We can define U

873
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:08,960
of X to be the probability function

874
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:12,160
which is the probability that the

875
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:15,599
stopped process equals B given that it

876
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:19,720
starts at X.

877
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,720
And so if we consider

878
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:27,200
u of x

879
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:30,400
and write it as the expected value of u

880
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:35,359
of x plus delta x.

881
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:36,880
Then if our deltat t time increment

882
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:42,400
is

883
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:43,920
very very short then this

884
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,040
expectation

885
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:52,319
will equal u of x.

886
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:58,160
So the likelihood of hitting B first

887
00:52:52,319 --> 00:53:02,160
will be the expectation of U of X a very

888
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:04,720
short increment into the future. And so

889
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:10,960
if we take the expectation with respect

890
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:15,359
to the delta X variable, well delta X is

891
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,880
X of T plus delta T minus X of T.

892
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,960
Then

893
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:22,079
if we

894
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:24,400
assume that our function u this

895
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,000
probability

896
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,599
is

897
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:34,000
twice differentiable then the tailaylor

898
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:39,359
series about the center x will equal u

899
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:42,240
of x plus delta x * the first derivative

900
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:47,440
plus a half delta x^2* the second

901
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:50,480
derivative plus small order terms of

902
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:54,800
delta x squared.

903
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:57,040
And so if we take an expectation of that

904
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,119
first

905
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,880
tailaylor series

906
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:06,960
on both sides, well the u of x is a

907
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,960
constant and then we have u prime of x a

908
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,839
constant times the expected value of

909
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,960
delta x and then plus a half the

910
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:17,280
expected value of delta x^2 time u

911
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:20,240
prime.

912
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:23,359
And we have mu deltat t is the

913
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:27,920
expectation of delta x. Sigma squar

914
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:31,599
deltat t plus little o of delta t is the

915
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:34,160
uh expectation of delta x^2.

916
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,319
So we have this

917
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:39,200
expansion

918
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:43,520
from the tailaylor series.

919
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:47,119
And from what we said before,

920
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:50,559
this expected value

921
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:53,920
of u evaluated at x plus delta x should

922
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:59,920
simply equal u of x.

923
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:01,440
And if that's true, then we get this

924
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:06,640
equation

925
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:11,200
for U prime and UP prime.

926
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:16,400
And if we take that

927
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:20,800
equation in U prime and UP prime, we get

928
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:23,200
and we divide by deltat T. We then get 0

929
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:27,040
is equal to mu

930
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:30,720
u u prime of x

931
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:34,599
plus a half sigma^ 2

932
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,599
up prime of x

933
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:43,359
and to be really precise you know a

934
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:46,720
little low uh factor to make it an an

935
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:51,359
equation. Now this

936
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:53,920
equation here is a second order

937
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:59,200
differential equation.

938
00:55:53,920 --> 00:56:02,240
And so what are solutions to

939
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:05,960
this second order

940
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,960
differential equation?

941
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,400
This is

942
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:20,760
sort of an interesting challenge. Um,

943
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,760
let me just get some more chalk here.

944
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,680
It's maybe been a number of years since

945
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:29,599
people have taken uh differential

946
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:33,119
equations, right? Um

947
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:38,400
but let's uh

948
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:43,640
let's consider um let's see u prime over

949
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,640
u prime is equal to

950
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:54,319
let's see have I done this right

951
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:57,839
u prime / u prime is equal to - 2 mu /

952
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,839
sigma^ 2

953
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:07,079
And so this is the derivative

954
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,640
is equal to the derivative of the log of

955
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,720
u prime.

956
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:22,319
Um

957
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:26,160
and so if we integrate this

958
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:31,280
um we basically get log of u prime

959
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:33,280
is equal to sort of - 2 mu / sigma^ 2

960
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,359
x

961
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,680
plus

962
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:38,680
a constant.

963
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:44,359
And this is true if mu is not equal to

964
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:44,359
zero.

965
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:52,240
And so we basically get that u prime is

966
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:55,799
equal to e minus 2 mu x over sigma^ 2

967
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,799
times a constant.

968
00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:02,319
Um

969
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:05,920
and what if we integrate

970
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:08,799
both sides of this? We then get u.

971
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:12,280
So what function has a derivative equal

972
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,280
to an exponential?

973
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,920
just the exponential. Yeah. So, so we

974
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:25,599
get u is just going to equal a constant

975
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:27,119
time eus 2 m u over sigma^ 2 x.

976
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:30,079
Um

977
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,799
and if mu is

978
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:35,520
equal to zero

979
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:39,359
then uh

980
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:44,040
we have the log of u prime

981
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:44,040
is equal to zero.

982
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,640
or the derivative.

983
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:55,200
Yeah, we or we have yeah we we basically

984
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,359
have the derivative of the log of u

985
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:04,960
prime is equal to zero.

986
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:06,640
So um we end up getting uh

987
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,480
let's see basically a linear function

988
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,839
for the solution. So let let me go to

989
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:14,400
the notes here. Well, we basically get u

990
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:19,200
um is equal to ax plus b if mu is equal

991
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:23,680
to zero and it's equal to this a

992
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:26,799
constant a * e - 2 mux over sigma^ 2.

993
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:30,000
All right. Well, this general solution

994
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:33,280
has to satisfy the initial conditions.

995
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,200
U of a is going to equal zero and u of b

996
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:43,440
is going to equal one. So if we start at

997
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:46,480
a where the uh basically we we stop at a

998
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:51,359
if we start at a so u of 0 is going to

999
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:55,440
equal zero and if we start at b um it's

1000
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:59,440
equal to one we end up getting this

1001
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:03,280
formula for what u is

1002
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:09,200
and so what's interesting to

1003
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:14,000
ask is how Does this probability vary

1004
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:18,000
with different drifts and volatilities?

1005
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,880
Okay, so here's the uh

1006
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,280
graph of these probabilities of hitting

1007
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,359
B before A

1008
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:31,040
when

1009
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:35,680
X well when A is zero.

1010
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:37,839
So if we have zero here and b is equal

1011
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:40,240
to three

1012
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:41,920
um

1013
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:47,359
then

1014
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:50,480
here's the uh initial value x between

1015
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:52,559
zero and three

1016
01:00:50,480 --> 01:01:00,400
and we have the probabilities of hitting

1017
01:00:52,559 --> 01:01:04,319
b before a. Okay. And if our mu is very

1018
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:06,079
high, so the trend is up in the brownian

1019
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:09,920
motion.

1020
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:13,200
So basically if if mu is greater than

1021
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,280
zero, then we basically have sort of an

1022
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:18,559
upward trending

1023
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,599
path on average and we get high

1024
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:27,200
probabilities of hitting B first.

1025
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:29,599
And as we decrease the drift from three

1026
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:34,559
down to

1027
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:38,000
0.5, we get this brown curve. And the

1028
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:41,599
limiting case where mu is equal to zero.

1029
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,520
So there's no drift at all

1030
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:49,040
corresponds to um

1031
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:53,760
the probability given by this line.

1032
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:56,799
And so given the starting value X, the

1033
01:01:53,760 --> 01:02:00,880
closer you are to B, the more likely you

1034
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:03,040
will be to hit B first and vice versa

1035
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,960
with with A.

1036
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:08,559
So

1037
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:11,599
these probabilities um vary with the

1038
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:13,119
different model parameters. Here is the

1039
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,720
corresponding graph when there's a

1040
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,640
negative

1041
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:21,280
drift.

1042
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:24,000
So the likelihood of

1043
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,680
sort of hitting B

1044
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,200
first

1045
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:31,119
um

1046
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:34,720
is sort of proportional when the drift

1047
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:41,280
term is zero uh basically to how close

1048
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:44,799
you are to be. But um as we increase the

1049
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,160
magnitude of the negative drift we

1050
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:49,520
basically get lower and lower

1051
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:51,359
probabilities coming out. So that's that

1052
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:55,760
solution.

1053
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:58,000
Okay. So uh see the next comment about

1054
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:01,839
brownie in motion is a very important

1055
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:04,640
property that the brownie in motion

1056
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:06,319
process is not differentiable.

1057
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:09,119
So when you look at a brownie emotion

1058
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:13,440
path, it looks very jagged. And in fact,

1059
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:16,400
that jaggedness is characteristic of

1060
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,079
there not being a smooth derivative or

1061
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,880
or it's not being smooth enough to

1062
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:24,000
compute a derivative. And so if we look

1063
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:27,359
at the increment of the Brownian motion

1064
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:31,680
from t to t plus delta t and have that

1065
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:34,720
being normal with mean zero and variance

1066
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:36,640
delta t the length of that increment. If

1067
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:39,920
we

1068
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:42,480
normalize the increment by deltat t. So

1069
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,920
we're basically trying to look at the

1070
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:49,839
approximate or the slope between t and t

1071
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:54,240
plus delta t. then that has a normal

1072
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:58,640
distribution with mean zero but variance

1073
01:03:54,240 --> 01:04:00,400
1 over delta t. So this normalized

1074
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:03,599
increment

1075
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,359
is going to not be well defined in in

1076
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:10,000
the limit. It's basically going to be

1077
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:11,680
equivalent to or the limiting value

1078
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,960
basically doesn't exist. It's basically

1079
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:18,880
becomes an explosive distribution.

1080
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:22,799
So, so that's a very important property

1081
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:25,200
of Brownian motion.

1082
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:28,960
Something that is a a sort of a positive

1083
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:32,960
property of Brownian motion is the issue

1084
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:37,359
of quadratic variation.

1085
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:42,160
And so to define quadratic variation

1086
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:43,839
um we consider looking at partitions

1087
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:47,400
of

1088
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:47,400
the time.

1089
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:55,880
So we have pi which is what a partition

1090
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:05,240
of the interval from 0 to t say

1091
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,240
where zero to capital t.

1092
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:12,240
So we have a time scale finishing at t

1093
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:16,240
starting at zero

1094
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:20,720
and we can just draw arbitrary points tj

1095
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:23,280
j equaling one up to n say

1096
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:27,119
um

1097
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:29,520
or one to n minus one

1098
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:35,839
that are inside

1099
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:35,839
this uh interval and they're ordered

1100
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:42,480
If we consider

1101
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:45,359
um

1102
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,359
the partition corresponding to these

1103
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:50,400
time points,

1104
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:53,880
we can define sort of this a magnitude

1105
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,880
of the partition

1106
01:05:54,480 --> 01:06:02,640
equal to the maximum of uh TJ

1107
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:07,720
minus TJ minus one

1108
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:07,720
over Okay. Um

1109
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:14,880
and then we can talk about the quadratic

1110
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:18,400
variation of the process

1111
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:21,760
which is to look at increments

1112
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:26,400
of B over these

1113
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:30,000
intervals from between TJ minus one and

1114
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:33,359
TJ. Square those

1115
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,079
and sum the squared of those values.

1116
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:38,960
Um this

1117
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:41,280
is a sort of an appropriate term for

1118
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,039
quadratic variation.

1119
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:50,640
Um

1120
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:56,319
and if we uh consider the uh

1121
01:06:50,640 --> 01:07:00,880
limit as the partition

1122
01:06:56,319 --> 01:07:04,400
width gets narrower and narrower then

1123
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:08,240
we'll define this limiting value to be

1124
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:10,319
the quadratic variation of the Brownian

1125
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:12,720
motion process.

1126
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:15,760
So we can define the quadratic variation

1127
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:18,559
corresponding to a given partition and

1128
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,640
then the quadratic variation overall if

1129
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:25,039
we take the limit over partitions that

1130
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:29,039
are getting uh infinitismally small.

1131
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:30,640
And the claim is that this quadratic

1132
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:33,119
variation

1133
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:36,799
is going to equal

1134
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:40,480
capital t the length of the period with

1135
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:45,559
probability one.

1136
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,559
So what does that mean? That means that

1137
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:53,200
for every realization

1138
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:57,119
of the process

1139
01:07:53,200 --> 01:08:00,240
or almost every realization,

1140
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:03,440
this quadratic variation

1141
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:05,839
is going to equal a constant.

1142
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:08,720
So here

1143
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:12,720
I'm looking at

1144
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:16,560
examples of random walks

1145
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:19,440
that are uh

1146
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:21,120
normalized to be sort of uh between time

1147
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:24,000
zero and one. So these are the

1148
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:26,480
normalized random walks which are

1149
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,679
effectively brownian or whose limits are

1150
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:33,279
brownie in motion. And in the top panel

1151
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:36,719
I'm drawing the path of the uh random

1152
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:38,719
walk with Gaussian steps. And in the

1153
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:42,440
bottom I'm drawing the cumulative

1154
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,440
quadratic variation.

1155
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:49,679
So this is up to 20 30 40 steps. Now as

1156
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,759
we increase to

1157
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:53,359
100 steps

1158
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:55,839
um

1159
01:08:53,359 --> 01:09:00,799
this cumulative quadratic variation is

1160
01:08:55,839 --> 01:09:03,839
getting pretty close to the uh

1161
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:07,199
time t of over which we're accumulating

1162
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:09,279
the quadratic variation. And as we

1163
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:11,839
increase

1164
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:14,159
the number of steps

1165
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:16,319
from 200

1166
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:21,679
to

1167
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:24,319
many more, a thousand and then 2,000.

1168
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:26,880
You can see that basically the quadratic

1169
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,400
variation of the process

1170
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:31,600
is

1171
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:33,120
accumulates basically to the time

1172
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,799
period over which that's being

1173
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:39,679
accumulated.

1174
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:42,799
So this property is a really nice

1175
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:45,600
property. What it highlights is that

1176
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:48,080
there there are some

1177
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,000
significant regularities to Brownian

1178
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:54,560
motion

1179
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:57,600
and the regularity here is that the

1180
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:59,360
variation of the increments

1181
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:02,960
um

1182
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:04,480
normalizes basically to the length of

1183
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,280
the period over which they're

1184
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:11,199
accumulated. So the quadratic variation

1185
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:14,560
is proportional to the time period. Now

1186
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:18,560
this idea or this property of Brownian

1187
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:22,080
motion is one that can be sort of

1188
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:24,719
explored with time series that we might

1189
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:26,400
think are well modeled by Brownian

1190
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:30,960
motion.

1191
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:34,719
So if we were to take um

1192
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:40,560
if we were to look at um

1193
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:44,000
a time series of the log of PT

1194
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:46,159
divided by P 0

1195
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,120
for PT

1196
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:52,640
equal to 01

1197
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:55,280
up to capital N.

1198
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:59,120
the uh

1199
01:10:55,280 --> 01:11:02,239
basically this for prices of assets in

1200
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:07,760
equity markets. This corresponds to the

1201
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:09,920
log return from time zero to t.

1202
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:14,719
And

1203
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:18,719
that log return from zero to t might

1204
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:21,040
follow a brownie in motion process

1205
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:24,800
um with drift

1206
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:28,239
positive return. And so you know we

1207
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:32,800
basically can have this process

1208
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:38,640
evolving. If we were to calculate

1209
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:43,480
the quadratic variation of this process,

1210
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:43,480
then if it followed

1211
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:50,719
if it followed a Brownian motion

1212
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:54,560
process, it would tend to grow

1213
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:59,840
according to a straight line with slope

1214
01:11:54,560 --> 01:12:02,159
equal to uh sigma squared.

1215
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,719
And

1216
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:08,400
in empirical modeling, if we look at

1217
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:10,800
this quadratic variation of an asset

1218
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:14,080
and see that

1219
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:16,400
it's not a straight line,

1220
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:18,320
there may be periods where the slope is

1221
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:22,320
low and periods where the slope is

1222
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:25,120
higher and it curves around.

1223
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:26,960
a way of trying to model the dynamic

1224
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:30,159
volatility

1225
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:34,080
could be um

1226
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:38,159
suggested by studying these plots and

1227
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:43,120
and using them. So it it's a very

1228
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:46,640
interesting uh property. Now um

1229
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:49,840
let's see I want to uh

1230
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:53,440
let's see there's one last note

1231
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:58,920
in the uh slide in the notes but before

1232
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:58,920
doing that I wanted to um

1233
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:07,760
highlight

1234
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:09,280
a connection of Brownian motion

1235
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:15,120
to

1236
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:20,320
uh the lelass distribution. And so if we

1237
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:22,239
if we have um let's see if we have B of

1238
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:27,159
T

1239
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:27,159
um which is Brownian motion

1240
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,920
and we observe

1241
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:40,880
uh it at uh

1242
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:45,159
let's see if we if we look at um

1243
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:45,159
basically X of

1244
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:55,600
Okay, if we observe it at

1245
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:59,120
at times t = 012

1246
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:01,280
sort of discrete times.

1247
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:07,600
Um

1248
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:11,920
then um the delta b of t are distributed

1249
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:14,880
as normal with mean

1250
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:19,199
I guess it's mu t

1251
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:22,159
and variance sigma squar time

1252
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:25,880
1 which is delta t

1253
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:25,880
and these are iid

1254
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:31,360
if so we have basically

1255
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:35,360
time points

1256
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:38,560
0 1 2 and so forth.

1257
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:41,520
If instead of observing the process at

1258
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:43,199
equal increments of time,

1259
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,440
let's

1260
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:48,400
consider the possibility that the time

1261
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:53,679
increments are random.

1262
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:55,760
So we have um let's consider

1263
01:14:53,679 --> 01:15:00,400
b of t

1264
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:03,280
for t equal to um

1265
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:05,600
t1 t2

1266
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:08,880
up to tn

1267
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:11,840
where the deltat t's

1268
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:16,080
the increments of time are distributed

1269
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:19,600
as an exponential random variable with

1270
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:23,760
some mean lambda Okay.

1271
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:26,000
So, we're not observing the process at

1272
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:28,880
regular intervals. We're observing it at

1273
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:33,440
at random intervals.

1274
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:36,960
It turns out then that the

1275
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:40,159
Brownian motion process

1276
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:44,400
has increments

1277
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:49,520
that are lelass distributed.

1278
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:51,760
So the delta b of t

1279
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:55,400
then will in fact have what's called a

1280
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,400
lelass distribution.

1281
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:03,520
And so instead of having a bell-shaped

1282
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:07,280
curve, which is a Gaussian distribution,

1283
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:11,360
it'll be sort of a bilateral

1284
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:14,159
exponential distribution about the mean.

1285
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:18,480
And it turns out that

1286
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:22,159
with standard and pores 500 returns,

1287
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:25,840
this lelass model seems to fit the data

1288
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:28,400
much better which leads to the

1289
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:31,360
consideration of what are called uh

1290
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:34,800
subordinated stochastic processes where

1291
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:37,840
the time scale is different than our

1292
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:40,480
sort of clock time.

1293
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:44,159
All right. Well, let's see. The final uh

1294
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:48,640
slide here for today addresses what are

1295
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:52,159
called adapted processes. And so

1296
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:56,159
in financial modeling,

1297
01:16:52,159 --> 01:17:01,600
um we can think of there being a

1298
01:16:56,159 --> 01:17:05,199
stochastic process X of T characterizing

1299
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:06,800
relevant dynamics in the system.

1300
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:09,360
And

1301
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:11,679
we can think of X representing the

1302
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:15,760
prices of a single asset or a collection

1303
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:20,239
of assets as it varies over time. Then

1304
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:22,480
as we let time increase,

1305
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:26,239
there are

1306
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:28,080
events that relate to what has happened

1307
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:32,480
so far.

1308
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:37,120
And we can think of these

1309
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:41,360
f script f subt to be the information

1310
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:45,480
on realizations up to time little t.

1311
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:45,480
And if we consider

1312
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:50,719
script f subt prime with t greater t

1313
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,199
prime greater than t then that's

1314
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:56,159
corresponds to information about all

1315
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:59,199
realizations from t up until t prime. So

1316
01:17:56,159 --> 01:18:01,679
it's giving us more information about uh

1317
01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:03,280
what's happened with the process.

1318
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:08,880
Well,

1319
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:13,280
if we want to look at the stochcastic

1320
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:17,840
modeling of a process

1321
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:20,320
Y that depends on trading on assets with

1322
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:27,520
dynamics X.

1323
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:30,719
Then we want our process Y to be adapted

1324
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:36,320
to X which essentially means we can't

1325
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:39,440
see the future in trading. And so our Y

1326
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:44,239
of T which is perhaps the value of

1327
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:48,320
trading up until time t um is a function

1328
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:50,400
only of the values of the process prior

1329
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:55,360
to time t.

1330
01:18:50,400 --> 01:19:00,400
And so we consider transformations of

1331
01:18:55,360 --> 01:19:03,280
our original process to the process of

1332
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:07,440
say trading gains and losses according

1333
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:11,920
to some trading strategy and these will

1334
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:13,440
be well defined if the process is

1335
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,719
adapted.

1336
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:20,800
So um with that

1337
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:24,080
the topics connect with what we had in

1338
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:26,960
our previous lecture which was we can

1339
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:29,440
have martinales

1340
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:32,320
defined on x

1341
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:35,120
and then we can define martingales

1342
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:38,800
relating to y

1343
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:44,400
if when we combine sort of adapted

1344
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:47,199
fun adaptive uh functions to X. And so

1345
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:50,560
the martingale theory sort of extends to

1346
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:53,199
modeling trading strategies effectively.

1347
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:55,600
And what's interesting with those

1348
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:59,600
techniques is that you end up

1349
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:02,159
transforming the process

1350
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:04,000
to have a constant mean. You know,

1351
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:09,760
martingales are processes with a

1352
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:13,280
constant mean. And uh so those arguments

1353
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:16,159
um are applied again and again uh in

1354
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:17,760
solving for their properties. And these

1355
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:21,280
uh

1356
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:25,920
option pricing you know can be expressed

1357
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:28,000
um in this in this uh context as well.

1358
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:31,480
All right, we'll finish there for today

1359
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,480
and uh
