00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,760
thank you everyone for joining my name

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,759
is Ana Maria and I would like to welcome

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,760
everyone to our renear speaker series

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,759
hosted by Latin xpro um I'm especially

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,200
excited to be hosting today as we are

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,640
going to start our Hispanic Heritage

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,320
Month and part of this initiative is

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,439
part of our our mission to build a pring

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,480
Community among Latinos and allies in

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,800
science while also empowering the

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,720
members of our community uh we hope that

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,000
through this program we highlight the

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,439
incredible work that our researchers are

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,399
doing both here at the broad and Beyond

15
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,520
as well as um hopefully fostering

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,680
collaborations with between the speakers

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,280
and people that are joining the talk and

18
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,079
also provide um opportunity for

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,520
networking uh we hope that by showcasing

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,920
these accomplishments of these

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,199
individuals we can provide um a platform

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,800
for people to learn about the research

23
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:55,280
that Latinos are doing and also try to

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,280
show and inspiring rols for under

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,000
repesentative groups in science our goal

26
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,879
here is to cultivate ful connections and

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,920
promote groundbreaking research as well

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,400
as celebrate the richness and diversity

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,320
of our community um so thank you again

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,799
for joining us or this do um and I hope

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,960
um you keep joining and also please

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,920
share um the speaker series with

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,640
everyone we from your network we Host

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,439
this every month um so now I leave it to

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,600
my colleague Ricardo who will be

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,560
introducing our speaker for today Ren

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,880
thank you for

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,159
joining H thank you very much Anna so

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,840
it's my pleasure to introduce Dr Ruben

40
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,360
Cordo

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,280
um he's a post Aral scientist with

42
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,159
fisheries and oceans Canada and he

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,000
explores aquatic ecosystems from Arctic

44
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,040
freshwater habitats to Coastal Marine

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,399
environments he'll discuss how factors

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,159
like glaz field history predation

47
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,680
aquaculture impacts species and

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,000
distribution and Community interactions

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,960
across these diverse ecosystems this

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,200
talk offers a glimpse into the complex

51
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,880
Dynamic shaping Aquatic Life from

52
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,759
historical climate events to modern day

53
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,840
environmental changes don't miss this

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,840
opportunity and take it away

55
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,960
all right thank you very much uh let me

56
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,960
see how this

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,200
works okay so first of all um I want to

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,760
thank Ricardo and Anam Maria for this

59
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,040
amazing invitation and thank you all for

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,800
attending this presentation name

61
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,319
exploring aquatic e ecology H in size

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,319
from fresh water to marine

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,920
ecosystems all right uh so in this

64
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,720
presentation I will start briefly with

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,000
my background and then I will describe

66
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,879
my work starting with the uh the work

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,120
that I develop in my masters followed by

68
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,720
my PhD work and then finishing with my

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,400
current project as a postdoctoral

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,040
research at fisheries and oceans

71
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,879
Canada

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,319
okay okay so I'm from a city in Bogota

73
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:55,280
called Colombia called K uh which is

74
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,239
located at the border with Venezuela um

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,800
and after

76
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,319
sorry having some issues okay then after

77
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,519
high school I moved to botan uh to study

78
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,840
biology at the univers the University

79
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,040
alandz where I joined the lab of

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,200
Professor Emilio Ri so in this lab I did

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,640
my undergrad and Masters working at the

82
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,159
total Lake which is a high mountain lake

83
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,799
located at more than 3,000 meters of

84
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,959
elevation here I analyze uh for my

85
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,319
undergrad the levels of electrification

86
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,239
by measuring phosphorus and nitrogen

87
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:32,200
concentrations and for my masters uh I

88
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,080
analyze the levels of heavy metals in

89
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:38,000
fish tissue because this area is the

90
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,319
largest producers of rainbow trouble for

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,239
human consumption So eventually I moved

92
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,080
to Canada where I studied a second

93
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,080
Masters at the University of Toronto and

94
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,239
H the first analysis that I will present

95
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,280
which is called H geographical history

96
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,319
of aquatic insects in Northern Canada so

97
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,840
this work was made under the supervision

98
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,439
of Professor Douglas

99
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,799
Cory so the Arctic is one of the most

100
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,120
fragile ecosystems in the planet and is

101
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,879
under great threat since effects of the

102
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,799
climate change are stronger in this

103
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,840
region organisms in these ecosystem are

104
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,680
highly adapted to EnV extreme

105
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,359
environmental conditions however they

106
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,040
can be affected by fast changes of those

107
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,680
conditions and studies on species from

108
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,560
northern Canada are necessary to assess

109
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,960
assess and compare how much impact

110
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,520
climate change is having in this

111
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,280
environment so this motivated us yeah so

112
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,240
this motivated uh the northern

113
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,199
biodiversity program which was an

114
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,479
initiative between researchers from Mill

115
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,800
University and the University of Toronto

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,440
to document changes in the Northern

117
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,840
arthropo

118
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,720
Communities so first let's review the

119
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,199
climatic history in North America and

120
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,520
the impact of the glacial periods during

121
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,639
the last 1.6 million years which is

122
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,720
known the as the place toin huge glacial

123
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,840
advances and retreated several times

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,039
over North America so here we can

125
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,400
observe the global temperature fluctu

126
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,600
fluctuation during the last 500,000

127
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,440
years and the multiple glacial and

128
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,479
interglacial periods the GLA the last

129
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,759
glaciation period uh which is called the

130
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,840
Wisconsin started about

131
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,560
75,000 years and the last glacial

132
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:21,000
maximum which cover most of uh more than

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:25,160
half of North America Ur about 22,000

134
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,880
years so this animation uh this is an an

135
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,600
animation that shows how the ice R in

136
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,720
North America since the last GLA maximum

137
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,360
and we see that initially uh the

138
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,199
beringia was exposed and Ice free acting

139
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,039
as refusion from where organisms from

140
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,000
bacteria to animals started to

141
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,720
recolonize the new ice free

142
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,960
land so we can observe that at the end

143
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,880
Binga the Binga land disappear and

144
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,880
that's what separated North America from

145
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,639
Asia all right so my study was focused

146
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,199
on aquatic insects from the orders EOP

147
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,199
copter andopa for several reasons for

148
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,800
example they are the base of the food

149
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,120
Change in these aquatic environment

150
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
environments they are also WID spreads

151
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,319
across Northern Canada including the

152
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,199
Arctic archipelago they are easy to

153
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,120
collect and preserve and they are

154
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,319
sensitive to environmental changes which

155
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,479
makes them good

156
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,280
indicators so the objective of this

157
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,000
study was to evaluate the influence of

158
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,960
the last glaciation on intraspecific

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,080
structure on within this species so we

160
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,120
wanted to determine if there is evidence

161
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,120
that widely distributed species of

162
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,720
aquatic insects survived during the last

163
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,440
glaciation in two or more refugia for

164
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,599
example beringia or the Southeastern

165
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,639
refugia the hypothesis was that

166
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:46,720
populations of widely distributed

167
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,759
species that exhibit both genetic and

168
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,240
geographical structure originated from

169
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,639
two or more glacial

170
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:58,440
refugia so to collect the specimens uh

171
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,440
we went to these areas in in in Northern

172
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,319
Canada uh us standardized Protocols of

173
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,360
sampling on each side and or thing

174
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,599
collected in four sites per echor region

175
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,479
that they were the Boreal the subarctic

176
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,759
Antarctic to cover East and West

177
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,160
Canada for the specimen identification I

178
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,280
use a co1 barcode approach which is

179
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,199
which is a very simple but efficient

180
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,800
method to obtain a reliable genetic

181
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,840
identification of

182
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,400
species all the sequences were

183
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,280
contrasted in the Gin bank and Bol and

184
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,120
that database to obtain their

185
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,240
identification and then used to

186
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,240
construct the philogenetic Trees of each

187
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,400
groups but how we can differentiate

188
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,199
species with genetic and Geographic

189
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,159
struct okay so in this example we can

190
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,479
see that this mayfly species shows

191
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,639
multiple individuals with a clear

192
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,360
genetic structure but not a geographical

193
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,520
structure while for disorder species we

194
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,919
observe both the genetic and

195
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,879
geographical structure and the

196
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,599
populations from Eastern Canada is

197
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,800
different from the population from

198
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,039
western

199
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,199
Canada okay so for the results I

200
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:13,919
generated I I obtain Bas on philogenetic

201
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:17,240
treats for each order inop Tropa and

202
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:20,520
plopa and I could identify 18 species

203
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:24,120
spread across East and West

204
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,800
Canada so from those uh uh species

205
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,720
widespread seven species show both the

206
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,919
generic and geographical structure as uh

207
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,200
this um figure is

208
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,959
showing and in addition um we calculated

209
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,279
the Divergence

210
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:43,919
time and for six species uh we observed

211
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,519
a similar range of Divergence signs uh

212
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,200
suggesting a common event that matched

213
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:50,839
with the duration of the last glal

214
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,200
period while for only one species that

215
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:57,000
Divergent that Divergence time was

216
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,760
earlier and apart from that the genetic

217
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,920
distance between the East and West

218
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,720
population of these species suggested

219
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,040
instead that they were two different

220
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:10,560
species and um that the classification

221
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,920
generate this spean event so the main

222
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,640
conclusions for this project were that

223
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,079
um I obtained evidence of the species

224
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,320
with genetic and geographical

225
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,399
structure um the Divergence time allowed

226
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,120
to detect the effect of the L glaciation

227
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,560
on aquatic insect

228
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,920
populations uh we found evidence of a

229
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,640
species occurring in different fuia

230
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,640
during the last glacial

231
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,839
period and finally I found also evidence

232
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:42,160
of ESP speciation H due to glacial

233
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,240
isolation so for this work I want to um

234
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,880
thank my supervisor D Curry all the

235
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,720
people in my committee uh the northern

236
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,640
biodiversity program and the people in

237
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,560
my

238
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,560
lab okay so now I will talk about my PhD

239
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,079
project at the University of Toronto but

240
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,360
this time with Professor Don Jackson uh

241
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:03,200
this project was called parents of a

242
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,640
species cooccurrence a species pairwise

243
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,200
approach so the great ecologist Robert

244
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,800
MacArthur stated that eological patterns

245
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,079
are only interesting if they are

246
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,920
repeated they might be repeated in space

247
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,240
or in time and they might be repeated

248
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,959
from species to species so as

249
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
introduction one central question in

250
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,440
ecology is how natural communities are

251
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,440
structured and among the different

252
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,320
approaches used to address this question

253
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,079
the species currence analysis have been

254
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,680
a prevalent subject that goes back to

255
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:34,720
the 1940s with classical studies that

256
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:37,200
analyze currence parents across multiple

257
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,760
communities however it was the Assembly

258
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,720
of a species Community by diamond in

259
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,600
1975 the publication that spark an still

260
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,519
ongoing de debate about whether natural

261
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,000
communities are structured by determined

262
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,000
rules in this publication Diamond

263
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,880
concluded that competition was the main

264
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,720
mechanism structuring be communities

265
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,800
which was in agreement with influential

266
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,800
contemporaries studies that also propos

267
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,880
competition as the most important

268
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,399
mechanisms structured in those

269
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,279
communities Diamond also mentioned that

270
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,320
competition generates the Forbidden

271
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,440
combination which means species that

272
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,880
exhibit a pattern of segregation or

273
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,760
negative cooccurrence one example of

274
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,800
this forbiding combination was observed

275
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,480
between two species of Coco doves which

276
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,079
never cooccur in the same island as as

277
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,120
is observed in this map so Diamond

278
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,680
attributed this segregated par to the

279
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,480
strong competition between those species

280
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,560
for similar

281
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,440
resources however Diamond's ideas were

282
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,760
challenged by Conor and simlo in 1979

283
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,760
who argued that the effect of

284
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,519
competition was typically assumed

285
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,639
instead of being properly tested and

286
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,680
that the community should be analyzed

287
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,519
entirely instead of selecting only the

288
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,240
species pairs that exhibit these

289
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:54,160
forbidden combinations and for this they

290
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,399
proposed the null model as equivalent of

291
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,279
the N hypothesis to test competition as

292
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,040
main factor in natural environment

293
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:03,760
so the species currence analysis has

294
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,920
been an active field since and

295
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,880
subsequent studies of species currence

296
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,839
have produced important advances in this

297
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,760
area like development of Robos metric or

298
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,680
reliable randomization methods that

299
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,320
allow to find evidence of nonrandom

300
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,560
structor in natural communities however

301
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,440
most of those stories have used the same

302
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,639
approach that consisted in analyze the

303
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,399
identity of the entire Community

304
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,160
ignoring individual species SPS

305
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,240
Association that can provide important

306
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,120
ecological information so we went from

307
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,800
one side to the

308
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,360
other so for example let's suppose that

309
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,560
one pair of species species one and two

310
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,440
exhibit at large segregation value while

311
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:46,040
another pair of species three and four

312
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:49,279
have a large a large aggregation value

313
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,480
but when these values are added up they

314
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,160
can cancel each other out producing a

315
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,959
new cooccurrence uh value that is non

316
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,959
different not different from random

317
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:00,040
hiding the actual eological relevance of

318
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,959
those species pairs

319
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,120
however if we analyze individual species

320
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,160
SPS we can determine which part are

321
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,360
aggregated segregated or randomly

322
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Associated which increases the Insight

323
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,600
of the community structure and open

324
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,519
questions about ecologically relevant

325
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,760
species so general question of my my

326
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,399
thesis was how does our understanding of

327
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,120
community structor improve from the

328
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,560
classical approach the whole Community

329
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,959
to the individual species per wise

330
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,120
approach the objective was to test

331
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,600
ecological hypothesis related to

332
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,600
patterns of association between species

333
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,600
the signal of biotic interactions and

334
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,800
the influence of biotic and atic factors

335
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,600
using a species wise

336
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,920
approach so I divided my thesis in three

337
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,360
data chapters that I intend to go H

338
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,079
quick uh so in chapter one I assess the

339
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,360
community structure

340
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:53,600
consistency of Association parents and

341
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,800
Community assembly Theory using a

342
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,440
species wise approach in chapter two I

343
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,079
aim to determine the influence of

344
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,279
habitat side on the on these species

345
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,519
Association patterns and in chapter

346
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,639
three I wanted to determine the

347
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,480
influence of biotic factors like trait

348
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,040
on the species Association

349
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,040
parents so in the first chapter I

350
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,279
intended to determine whether and how

351
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,759
species currence pattern are structured

352
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,560
analyzing Fish Lake communities this

353
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:23,079
imply to determine their direction as

354
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,920
well as their magnitude and

355
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,399
consistency in addition I tested whether

356
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,160
ecologically Related Group of species

357
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,639
like compar species that share habitat

358
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,959
requirements or Predator PR exhibit

359
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,040
currence pars expected by Community

360
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:40,360
assembly

361
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,920
Theory so for this chapter I use the

362
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,959
database of the Aquatic habitat

363
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,399
inventory which is a program of the

364
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,480
Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources so

365
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,040
these database contain records of

366
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,800
incidents of 99 fish species distributed

367
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,320
in almost 10,000 legs

368
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:01,040
grouping 144 tary water Chase as is

369
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,360
shown in this map of

370
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,279
so in this study each water shed

371
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,160
represented one community that was

372
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,720
analyzed individually using a species

373
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,480
per wise not modal approach to obtain

374
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,120
the Cs scores which indicate the

375
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,360
segregation level between each spes

376
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,480
pairs with the obtain scores I obtain

377
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,600
also the standard effect sizes which

378
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,600
represented the cooccurrence value sorry

379
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,160
um and then for each species pair I

380
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,680
compar the standard effect sizes or the

381
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,720
currence levels across all the water

382
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,279
Shades they they occur to determine how

383
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,560
consistent was H or was the the pattern

384
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:40,600
that they show and in addition I

385
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,480
evaluated assembly hypothesis within

386
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,880
ecologically related groups of species

387
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,480
competitors prator prey and Spees with

388
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,319
similar habitat requirements okay so for

389
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,839
the first part the whole Community I

390
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:56,120
analyzed a total of 76 fish species and

391
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,519
I obtained the association value for 78%

392
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,279
of the possible species paars in this

393
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:04,040
figure the values of a standard

394
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,759
effect size on the right side indicates

395
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:09,120
a consistent segregated pattern or Spees

396
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:11,480
that that Cur less than expected by

397
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,040
Chance the values on the left side

398
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,160
indicate a consistent aggregated pn or

399
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,600
species that Cur more than expected by

400
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,480
chain and for species pairs with

401
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,399
confidence intervals Crossing zero the

402
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,519
par was considered not different from

403
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,160
random so overall I detected consistent

404
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,560
Association parents in 48% of the total

405
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,600
observed species pairs of which 27% were

406
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,240
consistently segregated and 21% were

407
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,880
consistently aggregated so in the second

408
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,079
part the hypothesis of community

409
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,920
assembly predicts Association pards

410
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:47,079
expected for group of species

411
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,920
biologically related so among the

412
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:51,720
processes expected to lead to

413
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,160
segregation pars I focus on competition

414
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,160
and predation for example it is

415
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,880
suspected that closely related species

416
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,079
that compete stronger for similar

417
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,360
resources exceeding a consistent pattern

418
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,600
of segregation however if the

419
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,480
association pattern is not consistent or

420
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,400
is consistently aggregated Instead This

421
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,319
Could indicate that competition is not

422
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,919
strong or other processes are more

423
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,240
relevant the same consistent segregated

424
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:20,439
pattern is also expected for predator PR

425
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,880
species when predation is strong however

426
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,480
other factors might also contribute uh

427
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,839
to segregation pars like habital

428
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,559
filtering or different Geographic

429
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,840
Orin and among the fact lead into

430
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:33,720
aggregation Parn I focus on the share

431
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,640
habitat

432
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,840
requirements so I analyze the

433
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,280
association pars within the centrar

434
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,039
family which is composed by bases and

435
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,160
Sunfish Sun fishes sorry H the members

436
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,280
of these families are predators and Ur

437
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,400
in similar habitats which according to

438
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,320
assembly Theory should generate a

439
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,520
pattern of segregation due to strong

440
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,200
competition for similar resources but

441
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,720
instead the results of the analysis

442
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,559
between the small modb and other species

443
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,120
of this family show consistent

444
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:03,600
aggregation parents and the same parent

445
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,799
was observed between the other members

446
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,760
of this family which suggest that

447
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:10,880
competition is not strong enough to

448
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,240
generate segregation at this

449
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,159
scale now for the species with similar

450
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,320
habitat preferences I analyze the

451
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:21,679
association pars of fish that require

452
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:24,280
cold water and the results show the

453
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,280
expected um consistent pars of

454
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:29,559
aggregation indicating the strong effect

455
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,480
of this mechanism on this group

456
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:34,240
last I analyzed the cooccurrence pars

457
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,080
between pre species like Minos and top

458
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,799
predators of these systems like buses

459
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,799
and Northern Pike and I detected a

460
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:46,039
consistent segregated pattern between

461
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:48,000
each prey and pror so this analysis H in

462
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,679
addition allowed me to determine what

463
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,799
prey was more segregated by the

464
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,440
Predators and we can observe that the

465
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:56,159
stronger effect was observed on the

466
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,120
northern red valy days and besides I

467
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:59,280
could detect also which of the top

468
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,080
predators gen

469
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,960
the strong segregation effect on the

470
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,799
praise which was the northern

471
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,000
pike so the conclusion for chapter one

472
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,320
were that the species per wise approach

473
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,280
provides an assessment of the overall

474
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,039
community and allows testing a specific

475
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,679
patterns on their ecological relevance

476
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:19,880
this is because by pulling all the

477
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,600
currence values as in the classical

478
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,280
whole Community approach H result in a

479
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,679
strong negative and a strong positive

480
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,200
relationship canceling each other out

481
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:29,760
with the wrong conclusion that the

482
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,440
community is a structor not different

483
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,559
from

484
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,520
random uh also species currence analysis

485
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,919
can produce robust information about

486
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,200
observe patterns that are repeated

487
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,400
across multiple independent units in in

488
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,640
our case where they waterers sheds in

489
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,799
large scale Geographic

490
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,080
areas and finally at the scale

491
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,960
considerer in this study I found

492
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,520
evidence supporting predation and

493
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,120
habitat preference as a stronger

494
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,120
mechanisms in structuring fish

495
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,120
communities than

496
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,640
competition okay

497
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:06,360
so moving to chapter two here I wanted

498
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,600
to determine the influence of habitat

499
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,480
size on the coor SPs so among the

500
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,200
environmental factors area and

501
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,960
specifically the species area

502
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,440
relationship has been considered one of

503
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,200
the few laws in ecology and it has been

504
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,480
one of the longest analyzed and most

505
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,640
frequently demonstrated in nature so

506
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,840
here we see a classic example of this

507
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,120
Parn detected by MacArthur and Wilson on

508
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,360
Caribbean island where the richness of

509
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,320
amphibians sound reptiles increases with

510
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,960
Island

511
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,280
area studies evaluating the influence of

512
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,200
area on a specific rich on a species

513
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,000
richness has also been applied to Lakes

514
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,280
this is because Lakes are considered

515
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,960
analogous ecosystem to Ireland due to

516
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,600
First the clear area delimitation as is

517
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,880
observed in islands in the bismar

518
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,799
archipelago or lakes in

519
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,280
Ontario and second elevation in island

520
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,159
in Islands uh is related to Habitat

521
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,080
diversity which allows for example in

522
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:00,960
Plants the establishment of different

523
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,280
communities along an altitudinal

524
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,799
gradient this factor is analogous to

525
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,200
depth in Lakes which generates habitats

526
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:09,919
with different characteristics that

527
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,720
allow different type of communities so

528
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,600
area and depth influence the

529
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:19,480
distribution and richness of species and

530
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:21,679
has been um um tested several times

531
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,559
however it is still not clear how these

532
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,679
factors can influence the Cur par in

533
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,000
fish

534
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,440
communities so the general goal of this

535
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,640
chapter was to determine whether and

536
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,000
how a bior factors related to Habitat

537
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,200
sitze like Lake area or dep influence

538
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,360
the species currence

539
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,400
pars so to determine the effect of uh

540
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,640
habitat sites on species currence I

541
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,440
group adjacent ter water sheds with

542
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,520
similar species composition in two

543
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,480
different regions in Ontario this allow

544
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,080
me to increase the number of flakes to

545
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,880
gain more statistical power because we

546
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,520
analyze more than 1100 Lakes per region

547
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,520
is still controlling for biogeographic

548
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,120
influences so um I will skip the methods

549
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,840
here and we can talk later about them

550
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,320
but basically I use our randomization

551
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,559
test to determine significance between H

552
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,440
Lake area and depth categories and

553
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,880
individual species per currence

554
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,960
values so in the second part I wanted to

555
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,559
evaluate the effect of area and DEP in

556
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,720
group of species that potentially

557
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:25,840
interact like prator preise or species

558
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,960
with similar habitat requirements like

559
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,760
cold water

560
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,640
fish and for this I use a met analytical

561
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,159
approach to determine the whole effect

562
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,840
between one single species with the

563
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:37,200
other species in the

564
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:39,520
group so in the results across all

565
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,520
species SPS I found that both factors

566
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,279
area and death in both regions Central

567
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,000
and Western exhibited highly significant

568
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,440
differences between the observed and

569
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,840
expected distribution of sensor slope

570
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,559
indicating a strong influence of habitat

571
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,400
size on the currence par now for the

572
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:57,640
group of prator prey I analyze the

573
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,760
currence values between each prator and

574
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,600
each prey and I detected significant

575
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,520
differences between the categories the

576
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,039
categories which indicate the strong

577
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,679
influence of Lake

578
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:11,480
Area um in this group so in this Forest

579
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,679
flood we can observe that the strong

580
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,880
negative currence effect in the smaller

581
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,080
Lakes okay legs like legs with less than

582
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,480
25

583
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,919
hectares is significantly decreases in

584
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,919
larger legs indicating that species

585
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:30,960
segregated in a smaller legs can Co can

586
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,720
coexist in larger

587
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,360
legs now for the group of cold species I

588
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,960
found no significant differences in

589
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,760
currence values across the death

590
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,960
categories however uh we can observe a

591
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,279
tendency for these species to be more

592
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,840
aggregated in deeper Lakes so in

593
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,400
addition we observe the lack of

594
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,080
Association parents in the smaller

595
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,559
category which indicates the strong

596
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,320
environmental filtering for these

597
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:56,240
species in shallower and warmer laks so

598
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,080
this result suggests that when Lakes

599
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,919
reach a minimum required dep these

600
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,039
species T to cooccur

601
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:05,559
positively so the main conclusions for

602
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,600
chapter two were that habitat size does

603
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:09,320
exert a significant influence on the

604
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,039
species Co

605
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,960
corespondence um in the group of PR or

606
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:15,919
pre species segregation effect was

607
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,120
reduced when area

608
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,200
increase and it is important to

609
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,440
recognize how habitat characteristics

610
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,880
reveal ecologically relevant information

611
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,399
that might be concealed when these

612
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:29,000
variables are not

613
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:31,320
considered now chapter three about the

614
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,520
influence of species traits on

615
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,399
cooccurrence parts so biotic

616
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,559
interactions have been recognized as

617
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:39,520
important factor structuring communities

618
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:42,279
and the magnitude of those interactions

619
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,640
can be related to the degree of similar

620
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:48,559
uh of similarity of species in their

621
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,399
traes the trade based approach have been

622
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,399
employed to predict community structure

623
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:54,440
by assessing whether the parents observe

624
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:57,120
can be expained by the proposed

625
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,440
mechanisms for example species with

626
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,520
similar traits are Ed to compete

627
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,240
stronger due to more resource overlap

628
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,360
than species with less similar

629
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,360
trait so among the species traits body

630
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,799
size have been recognized as major

631
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,000
influence on the strength of species

632
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:15,720
interaction particularly in aquatic

633
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,799
ecosystems as the structure of this

634
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:22,080
community can be determined by the pr

635
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:24,799
size range that a predator is capable of

636
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,919
consuming another important trait is the

637
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,080
temperature preference which has been

638
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:31,080
observed to influence the community

639
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,760
structure by selecting or restricting

640
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,039
species from various locations for

641
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,000
example plant communities adapted to low

642
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:42,320
Mountain Versus communities adapted to

643
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,080
high mountains or cold versus warm um

644
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,399
water fish

645
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,960
assemblages trophic level is another

646
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:50,559
important trade that has been used to

647
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,520
define the position of species in the

648
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,799
food chain and it can be used as well to

649
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,840
identify potential competitors or

650
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:01,840
species involved sorry in Predator

651
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,760
interactions so in this chapter I

652
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,840
intended to determine whether the

653
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,279
mentioned traits can explain the

654
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,360
co-parents obtain for all the species

655
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:13,399
Pairs and whether the signal of biotic

656
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,399
interaction can be

657
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,559
detected okay so I intended in this

658
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,159
chapter to test four hypothesis don't

659
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:26,880
worry I'm going to go uh quick about

660
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,880
this so the first hypothesis is that

661
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,440
across all the community or in general

662
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,360
the trade values are significantly

663
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,039
related to the concurrence pars across

664
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,039
all the species

665
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:40,159
pairs hypothesis two is for body size

666
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,960
and I expected a negative and

667
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,440
significant relationship between body

668
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,919
size dissimilarity and currence pars if

669
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,760
the signal of competition is strong this

670
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,720
is because species with similar body

671
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,240
size tend to compete stronger and

672
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,200
segregate each other but the segregation

673
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,080
level can be reduced when the

674
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,080
differences in body size increase

675
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:03,000
or alternatively a positive and

676
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,880
significant relationship if the signal

677
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,799
of predation is strong and this is

678
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,320
because species with similar different

679
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,960
body size tend to have a prator PR

680
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:15,799
relationship and segregate each

681
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,440
other uh hypothesis 3 is about

682
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:20,320
temperature preference and for this

683
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,960
trait I expected that species pair pairs

684
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,960
having more dissimilar temperature

685
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,200
preferences exhibit more segregated

686
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,200
parns due to environmental filtering

687
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,919
while aggregation is expected for

688
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,159
species with similar temperature

689
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,679
preferences and for hypothesis four

690
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:37,640
about tropic level very similar to body

691
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,320
size I expected a negative and

692
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,640
significant relationship between trophic

693
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,840
level dissimilarity and coorp parents if

694
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,600
the feral of competition is strong

695
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,559
because species with similar trophic

696
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,200
levels tend to compete stronger and

697
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:50,200
segregate each

698
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:56,279
other and uh the segregation level uh

699
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,559
can be reduced uh when differences in

700
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,880
trophic level increase or alternative L

701
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,120
A positive and significant relationship

702
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,120
if the signal of predation is strong

703
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,559
because species with different tropic

704
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,159
levels tend to have PR PR relationships

705
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:11,760
and segregate each

706
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:13,480
other all right again so to summarize

707
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,760
the methods I perform a series of

708
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,640
multiple regressions and permutation

709
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,559
tests between the concurrence values and

710
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,720
the trait to determine the significant

711
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:25,120
effects we can talk about this later if

712
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:28,159
you uh have some questions so the result

713
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,039
for hypothesis one um including all the

714
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,799
trait and the randomization test for all

715
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,880
the species pairs show significant

716
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,720
relationship between the currence value

717
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,080
with temperature preference and tropic

718
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,080
level but not with body

719
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,120
size for hypothesis 2 the result for

720
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,880
body size dissimilarity at currence

721
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,880
values shows a negative quadratic Trend

722
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,159
although this relationship was not

723
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,080
significantly H was not significant

724
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:57,159
according to the permutation test

725
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,039
indicating that body size dissimilarity

726
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:01,159
do not predict Val of cooccurrence

727
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,279
between

728
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:06,399
Spees for hypothesis 3 we observe a

729
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:07,919
positive and significant linear Trend

730
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,840
between temperature preference and

731
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,720
currence values indicating the strong

732
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,399
influence of environmental filtering

733
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,399
that means that species with larger

734
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:17,960
differences in temperature preference

735
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:20,600
tend to be

736
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,440
segregated and finally for hypothesis 4

737
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,880
I obtain a positive and significant

738
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,960
relationship for both the linear and the

739
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,240
quadratic term of trophic level and the

740
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,919
currence values which suggests that

741
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,440
species with larger differences in

742
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:38,000
trophic level tend to cooccur negatively

743
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,679
however um here the signal of predation

744
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,760
uh is observed while the signal for

745
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:46,080
competition was not clear corroborate

746
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,440
corroborating previous uh

747
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,200
results right so the main conclusion of

748
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:54,159
chapter three um I detected significant

749
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,840
Association pars between the predictor

750
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,039
and the response variables which

751
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,880
indicates an overall influence of the

752
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:03,279
the traits on the currence

753
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,080
pattern temperature preference was

754
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,960
highly associated with the currence

755
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,399
values which indicate a strong influence

756
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,600
influence of environmental filtering in

757
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:15,080
in the structure of these

758
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,120
communities trophic level was

759
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,159
significantly uh or significantly

760
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,760
influences the currence values and

761
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:24,080
species with different trophic levels

762
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,399
tend to segregate each other the signal

763
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,840
of predation was detected here but not

764
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:32,480
the signal of competition

765
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:35,120
and finally contrary to expected uh by

766
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,799
Theory body size was not significantly

767
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,559
related to the currence par and so the

768
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,760
this trait cannot predict interaction

769
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:44,519
between

770
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,159
species so in this part I want to

771
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,399
acknowledge I want to thank my

772
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,320
supervisor Don Jackson and the members

773
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,760
of my committee and all the people from

774
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,600
Jackson lab and yeah like all the people

775
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,720
that made possible this

776
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,919
journey and last I present the current

777
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,399
project that I'm working on as a

778
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,080
postdoctoral researcher at the DFO

779
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,360
Department of fisheries and oceans

780
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,639
Canada about the effect of shellfish

781
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,799
agriculture industry on SO planton size

782
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:13,480
distribution in several Coastal ements

783
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,000
in Canada here Ruben would you like to

784
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,440
take a question about the last section

785
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,360
or would you like to keep them for the

786
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,960
yes if um I don't

787
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,559
know uh so we have a question from irn

788
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,840
jungar uh if competition wasn't a big

789
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,919
factor why did competing species

790
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,720
consistently aggregate rather than just

791
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,240
being

792
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,720
random I mean we need we need to

793
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,000
understand that I am analyzing at the

794
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,600
level of the lake right within the legs

795
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,120
there are many habitats that they can

796
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,120
they can uh where competition can be

797
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,240
important we we need like a more

798
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,039
experimental and this experiments have

799
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:53,200
been performed for like a years showing

800
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,600
that competition is very important but

801
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,720
at this level competition doesn't show

802
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,600
didn't show like a clear signal while

803
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,480
predation did so that's that's the main

804
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,720
difference it's not that competition is

805
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,679
not acting it's not acting at the the

806
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:12,200
level that I um

807
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:12,200
analyze does it make

808
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,000
sense yeah I believe so I didn't have a

809
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:24,039
followup or I didn't see a follow-up

810
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,080
question okay we can we can talk about a

811
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:27,200
little bit later but yeah sure that's

812
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,559
that's the main reason it's just the

813
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:34,320
skill that that I was

814
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:37,279
analyzing so um again so the shellfish

815
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,039
aquaculture in Canada um is an industry

816
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,559
that has experienced substantial growth

817
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,559
in the since the 1970s and today is a

818
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,039
Threading industry producing millions of

819
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,679
metric tons of food meeting not only

820
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,279
domestic but International demand and

821
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,080
expanding across coastal zones

822
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:57,200
highlighting is its economic importance

823
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,679
however as this industry spans the focus

824
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,559
of ecological he studies has

825
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,000
increasingly shifted toward

826
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:05,200
understanding of the interaction of this

827
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,080
activity with surrounding habitats

828
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,279
specifically analyzing the effect of

829
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,120
higher on higher trophic levels and

830
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,120
local clonic

831
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,559
communities so shellfish uh feed mainly

832
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,120
on plantonic organisms and the high

833
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:23,279
density of shellfish produced by the

834
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,960
aquaculture activity generates different

835
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:28,679
effects on the local activ local habitat

836
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,440
and organisms one major effect is the

837
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,720
greasing pressure generated by the

838
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,279
shellfish on higher trophic levels for

839
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,600
example experimental studies found a

840
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,480
significant effect of the shelfish

841
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,360
density on the development of lobster

842
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,200
laral stages and because the strong

843
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,919
competition excerted by shellfish on the

844
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,360
microp planton resource lur lar exposed

845
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:53,880
to higher shellfish density exhibited

846
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,880
lower development and

847
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,159
survival but how is the plantonic

848
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,919
community structur so basically the plon

849
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,480
is composed by two main groups the

850
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,080
phytop planton and the S planton phytop

851
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,039
planton is composed by the primary

852
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,280
producers the organisms transforming and

853
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:11,079
storing the solar energy accounting for

854
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,119
most of the smaller size fractions like

855
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:16,240
the Pico and nanop planton and a studies

856
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:18,480
that analyze impact of shellfish grazing

857
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,520
pressure on this group observe that the

858
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,040
smaller phop planton fractions that

859
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,919
cannot be filtered by shellfish exhibit

860
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,320
an increment in abundance compared to

861
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:28,599
the larger H fractions more intensely

862
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,240
Gra

863
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,119
the other group is the so planton and

864
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,040
these organisms are the main component

865
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:35,679
of the larger size fraction of planton

866
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,679
like the mesos planton which is the

867
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,240
focus group of this study so let's

868
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,000
briefly review the importance of this

869
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,839
group the mesop planton fraction has two

870
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,679
main key characteristics that makes it

871
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:49,440
an interesting study system first it

872
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,440
plays a fundamental role in Marine

873
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,240
ecosystem by acting as a critical trophy

874
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,320
lean facilitating the energy transfer

875
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,520
from the primary producers or phop

876
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:03,599
planton to higher levels that includes

877
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:07,240
um or Bol and other Fisheries Target the

878
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,560
species and second so plant exhibit a

879
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:12,079
high degree of environmental sensitivity

880
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,839
due to their physiological adaptations

881
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,560
and life history strategies making them

882
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,480
highly responsive to variation of

883
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,240
environment conditions like temperature

884
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,880
salinity and nutrient concentrations so

885
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,040
given these attributes many

886
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,880
researchers have advocated for the

887
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,839
establishment of enhanced monitoring

888
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,800
programs to facilitate the early

889
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,400
detection of ecological impacts

890
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,440
especially in our current scenario of

891
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,160
climate

892
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,440
change but although several large scale

893
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,320
programs have been established to

894
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,320
monitor long-term changes in Marine

895
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,359
health there is still a scarcity of

896
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,000
monitoring program specifically designed

897
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:48,720
to track the continuous effect of

898
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,480
aquaculture on plantonic communities so

899
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,680
this motivated the initiative of the

900
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,400
aquaculture monitoring program by the

901
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,000
DFO which aims to track H and analyze

902
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,800
changes in the structure of plan plon

903
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,440
communities to develop strategies and

904
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,880
conservation

905
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,720
policies so we have seen that the mesop

906
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,119
planton plays a key ecolog ecological

907
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,880
role as linked between primary producers

908
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,200
and higher trophic levels and is highly

909
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,960
responsive to environmental changes as

910
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,560
well we know that shellfish aquaculture

911
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,960
has a range of effects on these

912
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,440
plantonic communities and although these

913
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,040
effects have been evidenced by

914
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,400
theoretical and experimental analysis

915
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,560
still significant gaps remain

916
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,200
specifically concerned in the long-term

917
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,680
consequences of this interaction in

918
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,359
natural environments both within and

919
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,280
Beyond Bay scale

920
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,240
context so then the goal of the

921
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,000
aquaculture monitoring program is focus

922
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,319
on the long-term sustainability of the

923
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,599
shellfish aquaculture industry the

924
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:48,359
general objective uh of the is to track

925
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:50,200
changes in the coastal ecosystem by

926
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:52,119
absorbing alteration in the structure of

927
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,880
supp planton communities in presence of

928
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:56,319
shellfish Agriculture and provide

929
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:00,119
managers with robust and reliable data

930
00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:02,400
to make more effective conservation

931
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,000
policies specifically we focus on

932
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,640
determining the level of variation in

933
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,160
the mesos planton size structor

934
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,040
generated by three factors the station

935
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,440
or location within the bay which is

936
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,520
related to the morphological

937
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,480
characteristics of each Bay tie level

938
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,040
which is related to the replacement of

939
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,599
Grace individuals by by water exchange

940
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,920
and the day of sampling which is

941
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:26,440
associated with a stasic events like

942
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,040
rain or wind in addition uh we also aim

943
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,000
to determine the seasonal variation

944
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,200
pattern in the mop planton side fraction

945
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,040
by comparing monthly samples associated

946
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:38,240
with the local water temperature

947
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,800
gate so to address this objective the

948
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,200
team collected planton samples in

949
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,680
different Bays with presence of

950
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,200
shellfish aquaculture across several

951
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,079
regions um including Newland the

952
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:53,240
maritimes Gulf of of Stan Lawrence and

953
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,040
the Pacific as is observing the map at

954
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,839
each Bay the goal was to sample in three

955
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,319
different locations or stations for

956
00:37:56,839 --> 00:38:01,359
three consecu days and each day there

957
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:03,240
was one sampling during high tide and

958
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:04,680
another sampling during low tide so

959
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,760
these samplings were collected during

960
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,040
the Summers of 2020 and 2021 and in

961
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,200
addition H monthly samples were obtained

962
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:17,040
at TH arm Bay in Newland from June 20 uh

963
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,480
2021 to July

964
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,560
2022 after the samples were obtained and

965
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,119
preserved uh we used the microflow C

966
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,520
methodology which generates a measure

967
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,079
microscopic individual images to obtain

968
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,280
18 parameters

969
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,599
related to body size for each collected

970
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,680
individual so we selected the biovolume

971
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:36,760
prolate esid we're going to call it

972
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,839
biovolume because this parameter

973
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,920
accounts for the organism's shapes and

974
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:43,000
and surface area in relation to its

975
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,480
volume and for comparative Purpose with

976
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,359
reason

977
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,319
studies so the team aimed to collect and

978
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,280
analyze planton individual which sizes

979
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:53,400
about 30 micrometers but for this

980
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,000
analysis I include only the individuals

981
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,640
of the largest fraction size between

982
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,359
250 and 2

983
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,520
mm

984
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:06,200
okay so in the results uh we obtain more

985
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,280
than 500,000 individuals bi volume

986
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,560
values across the stud base and we

987
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,000
generated this viol flot to visually

988
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,920
detect differences in the bio bi volume

989
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,760
distribution of mesop planton across the

990
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,760
different base this figure um shows uh

991
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,119
the different size distribution across

992
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,359
the analyz base indicating that Bas are

993
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:29,119
not homogeneous in their so planton size

994
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:30,800
structure so to quantify the by volume

995
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,880
variation we obtain the cumulative

996
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,000
frequency distribution of each samples

997
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,920
and they were compared perir wise to

998
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,839
calculate the maximum variation between

999
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,400
those samples associated with the

1000
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,240
analyze factors for example this figure

1001
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,079
shows two cumulative frequencies from

1002
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,400
two

1003
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:50,160
samplings H comparing the effects of

1004
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:53,079
Tide so one sampling was made in high

1005
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,599
tide and the other one made in low tide

1006
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:57,839
and we compare that and exhibit low

1007
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,240
variation and we quantify that Vari by

1008
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:04,839
calculating the maximum distance using

1009
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:07,359
AOG test which in this case shows about

1010
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:10,119
7% of variation between these samples

1011
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,400
indicating a low effect of type while

1012
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,640
for these two samples in the right we

1013
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,280
see a greater maximum distance of 35%

1014
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,000
between those samples indicating a

1015
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,599
greater effect of these factors then the

1016
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,680
maximum distance from all the

1017
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,960
comparisons related to each factor TI

1018
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,440
day and station were pulled to obtain

1019
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,000
the Vari generated by each factor at

1020
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,760
each

1021
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,880
Bay so here we can see the result for

1022
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,880
the station effect and in general we

1023
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,400
observe a low bio volume variation

1024
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,119
across the base with exception of some

1025
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,240
pets where the variation between the

1026
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,280
stations show shows a median of 23%

1027
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,680
indicating a potential effect of this

1028
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,520
factor in this

1029
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:55,599
Bay similar results were observe for the

1030
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:58,240
tide effect with low values of variation

1031
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,960
detected for most Bay as well we can see

1032
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,040
here the higher variation in s Peters

1033
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,000
Bay with around 16% but still indicating

1034
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,960
a weak effect of this factor in the B

1035
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,079
volume

1036
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,240
variation and the factor day shows

1037
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:13,280
similar results than the previous Factor

1038
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,599
but the variation level Associated to

1039
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,920
this Factor was much larger for some

1040
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,880
Peters than the other base with around

1041
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,119
35% of variation When comparing samples

1042
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,920
from different

1043
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,880
days finally we pull together all the

1044
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,000
variation from the three Factor and we

1045
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:33,359
observe the overall small V volume

1046
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,680
variation across the compare base as

1047
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,040
well with some Peters showing the

1048
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,960
largest overall variation a potential

1049
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,079
explanation to this variation in some

1050
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,800
Peters might be related to the higher

1051
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,520
proportion of area used for shelish

1052
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,040
aquaculture in this Bay which is around

1053
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,400
40% of leas coverage compared to the

1054
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,240
other Bays however we are still H

1055
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,720
testing this

1056
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,800
hypothesis so now we focus on some

1057
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,040
Peters which is the B with higher

1058
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,920
variation and we determine the amount of

1059
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,079
variation H between the the categories

1060
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,760
of each factor and this figure shows

1061
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:10,560
that the factor day for example the

1062
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,960
higher variation was observed between

1063
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,680
day one with days two and three and for

1064
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,040
the for the factor station uh the

1065
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,200
largest variation the largest

1066
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,640
differences were observed between the

1067
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,880
outer station with the mid and the inner

1068
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,920
stations and the level of variation due

1069
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,000
to TI effect was lower than the other

1070
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,400
Factor

1071
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,319
so we also generated this nmds which is

1072
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,960
a nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling uh

1073
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:42,640
it's an ordination plot and this plot

1074
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,680
allows us to see um a separated group of

1075
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,720
samples from the other Station group by

1076
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:51,160
the red Dash um ellipse apart from the

1077
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,960
other stations and also we observe and

1078
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:58,079
the green ellipse the samples from day

1079
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,079
one group apart from the other uh days

1080
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:03,200
now we wanted to test the significant uh

1081
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:06,520
Factor effects and for this we perform

1082
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,800
linear mix effect models comparing three

1083
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,359
quantiles of each sample distribution

1084
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,839
with station and Tide as the fix effect

1085
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:16,559
and they consider as the random effects

1086
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:18,319
so the results show significant

1087
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,200
differences for the station across the

1088
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,720
three quantities between the outer and

1089
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,880
the middle stations and between the

1090
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,599
outer and inner station we observe

1091
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,400
significant differences at the larger

1092
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:32,119
biolume conle

1093
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,000
for the random effect day the model um

1094
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:35,680
results show highly significant

1095
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,559
differences across the three quanti

1096
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,400
indicating a strong effect of this

1097
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:42,200
Factor representing stochastic events

1098
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,000
the factor tide and its interaction with

1099
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,480
the station show no

1100
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,680
significance so finally to determine the

1101
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,400
seasonal effect we analyze H monthly

1102
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,599
samples collected between June 2021 and

1103
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,240
in July

1104
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:57,720
2022 and we obtain the bio volume

1105
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,640
fraction distribution for 13 months and

1106
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,240
as expected we observe significant

1107
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,400
differences in the fraction distribution

1108
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,359
across across different months so in

1109
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,200
general we can see AB sortal par where

1110
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:10,960
the largest V volume media values were

1111
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,680
associated to the colder

1112
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,040
months um the temperature Trend can be

1113
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,400
tracked with the red uh dash line and

1114
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,359
the temperature values in the right ya

1115
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:25,599
AIS and finally our regression analysis

1116
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:27,920
between the medium biolume and the mean

1117
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,960
temperature show a negative significant

1118
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,079
relationship supporting this

1119
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,240
part so the main

1120
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,040
conclusions um of this work are that in

1121
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,839
general we observe a low variation in

1122
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,760
the v volume fractions distribution

1123
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:43,480
between samples related to the factors

1124
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,839
analyzed with a higher or like an

1125
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,680
exception observed in some

1126
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:51,640
pets contrary to expected the factor day

1127
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,920
of sampling which we thought that it was

1128
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:56,000
not like important related to EST

1129
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,720
stochastic events show more variation

1130
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,319
than the type level or the

1131
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,319
station the higher variation observed in

1132
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:05,760
some Peters might be potentially related

1133
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:07,440
to the more intense shelfish aquaculture

1134
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,000
develop in this

1135
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,760
vein the seasonal pattern showed that

1136
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,520
colder months exhibit greater abundance

1137
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,599
of larger mesop planton individuals and

1138
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,760
as a general conclusion long-term

1139
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,559
monitoring programs are fundamental to

1140
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,800
track changes in the size fraction

1141
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:27,000
structor of plantonic communities which

1142
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,920
is the foot of the shellfish industry to

1143
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,520
ensure the sustainability of this

1144
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:34,599
growing and necessary activity so with

1145
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,839
this I want to thank the P of this

1146
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:39,960
project uh also the members of the F lab

1147
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:43,160
here at the housei University to all the

1148
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,599
members and collaborators of the team

1149
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,680
again thank you uh to Anam Maria and

1150
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,720
Ricardo for this opportunity and thank

1151
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,520
you all for your attention and I'll be

1152
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,520
happy to take any

1153
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,760
questions awesome so thank you very much

1154
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,240
Ruben so first thing is that we have a

1155
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,240
short survey so if you can please fill

1156
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,040
out the survey because your feedback is

1157
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,400
very valuable and we're gonna open the

1158
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,880
Flor question so Irwin also had another

1159
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,160
question but why aggregate rather than

1160
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,040
being random or negative and that was

1161
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,960
from the end of the first section I

1162
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:21,520
don't know Russell can we get Irwin on a

1163
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:24,119
mic maybe he wants to have more of a

1164
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,400
discussion up to Irwin but if you can

1165
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:27,440
start by answering the question and IR

1166
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,319
Irwin can let us

1167
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,319
oh there he is

1168
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,839
yeah uh hello can you hear me yes yeah

1169
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:39,240
I'm referring to a slide that was right

1170
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:41,839
at the end of the first section where

1171
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:45,280
you showed the competing species uh

1172
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:48,839
tending to aggregate this ones I can't

1173
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:53,720
see your slides sorry oh sorry

1174
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:56,200
yeah right so if the species were were

1175
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:59,200
okay competing the original hypothesis

1176
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:01,800
was that they would segregate and I

1177
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,200
understand you said that at this at the

1178
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,319
level you're looking that was not strong

1179
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,319
enough to

1180
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:09,880
detect but if that's so I guess I would

1181
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,240
expect that what you'd see is sort of

1182
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,200
random whereas what you're seeing is

1183
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:18,359
consistent aggregation rather than

1184
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,680
neither so why are they consistently

1185
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:23,040
aggregating well they they are still

1186
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:26,480
like a all these species they share uh

1187
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,960
similar habitat requirements so um in

1188
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:32,200
the paper where we connected these ideas

1189
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,800
to like saying that this is this uh

1190
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:37,559
factor is was stronger than competition

1191
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,720
organizing the the structure of these

1192
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:44,119
communities at this level right okay so

1193
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,160
again so again so if we if we go deep

1194
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:48,839
inside the lake we are going to see that

1195
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,240
areas uh where like a I don't know the

1196
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:55,000
small M BS is is the largest of these

1197
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:57,079
interets were like a present like in

1198
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,160
like around that area in the lake L

1199
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:01,599
within the lake uh there is not going to

1200
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:04,640
be any other in tret especially the

1201
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,359
small ones but we are like just checking

1202
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,559
the present substance across in the

1203
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:11,559
entire

1204
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:16,920
Lake that's that's that's the the main

1205
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:18,760
reason why um competition was not

1206
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,920
observed the

1207
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:23,760
signal okay thank

1208
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,240
you yeah so please feel free to post

1209
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,920
questions so I had a question actually

1210
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,960
so in your first section you said

1211
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:32,920
there's like a 8% difference between the

1212
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,440
species is that like what is um like how

1213
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:38,119
do you measure is there a cut off for

1214
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:42,119
species Divergence or um according to

1215
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:44,680
the co1 papers since the beginning they

1216
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:47,240
they the their agreement was like around

1217
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:51,880
2% and that's based using like a

1218
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:54,119
molecular and also morphological data so

1219
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,920
when when when a species is about four

1220
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:59,599
or 5% is considered to different species

1221
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,440
populations show that amount of genetic

1222
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:05,559
Divergence they are considered to live

1223
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:08,520
species so in our case we observe like

1224
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:11,920
all the species were below that uh

1225
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:15,559
threshold uh

1226
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,160
here here for example this species is

1227
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:21,599
less than

1228
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:25,280
two or like around two this is way less

1229
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:28,000
than one but here we can observe the

1230
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:31,000
that the genetic distance is 3 + 4

1231
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:35,640
that's almost 8% so so yeah that that

1232
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:38,400
started to to uh indicate possibly it's

1233
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:40,480
two different species and the speciation

1234
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:46,160
event was because they were separated in

1235
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:50,839
the beringia and the southern planes

1236
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:52,559
F so it's um have you seen indication of

1237
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:54,359
not just like geographical distribution

1238
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,760
that changes speciation but maybe like

1239
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:58,640
they go to different like niches

1240
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,640
ecological niches

1241
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,040
that was I mean like I'm pretty sure

1242
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:07,559
that there should be like a evidence for

1243
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:10,920
that but that I I didn't I didn't delve

1244
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:14,640
into into that part we're just focusing

1245
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:17,079
on this big scill and and have you seen

1246
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,559
a lot of molecular changes without many

1247
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:22,240
like um morphological changes or is it

1248
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:25,599
both have to be in coincidence to Define

1249
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:28,200
a species I mean like this this species

1250
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:32,319
is still consider one species in North

1251
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,960
America so I don't I don't know if like

1252
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:38,359
if there is like a

1253
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:40,200
taxonomies this group I invited to to

1254
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:44,640
dig into this part because it's very

1255
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:47,799
interesting how um these PES they look

1256
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:50,799
similar they they they are occurring

1257
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:57,640
similar habitat so is is the differences

1258
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:59,400
are not uh I'm not very clear so yeah

1259
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,200
yeah so uh I just going to ask one more

1260
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:04,040
time if anyone else has questions please

1261
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,559
feel free to ask um otherwise we're

1262
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:08,839
coming up against the

1263
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,680
hour so once again I'd like to thank

1264
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:12,680
Ruben for doing this talk for us we had

1265
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,720
a lot of interest from a lot of

1266
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,480
different types of people at the bro

1267
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,559
which is really cool so we had uh you

1268
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,040
know some people who were super

1269
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:24,200
interested in evolution so that was

1270
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:28,480
great so thanks again and beend

1271
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,480
it thank you everyone
