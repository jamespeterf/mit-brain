2
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,199
how you doing today sir can I see you

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,199
like a registration please what was I

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,720
doing yeah speeding how'd you know I was

5
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:21,519
speeding you're looking a little tired

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,599
how long you been driving today maybe 2

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:28,480
hours where'd you come from New Jersey

8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:32,320
how far away is New Jersey uh 170 miles

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,040
so 170 miles divided by 2 is 85 mph sir

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,559
isn't that a little fast okay you knew

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,000
my average speed was 85 but how do you

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,039
know there was an instant when I was

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,280
traveling at

14
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,760
85 sure simple math the mean value

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,680
theorem states that at one moment your

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,760
instantaneous speed is going to match

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,199
your average

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,199
speed you got

19
00:00:53,079 --> 00:01:00,840
me for more MIT moments from MIT open
