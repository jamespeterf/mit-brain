1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Our next speaker and then we'll go right

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:10,160
into that discussion is Dr. Phil Button.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,400
Now Phil is uh Fiona's co-conspirator if

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,559
you will in the innovation ecosystems

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,119
work. He is a senior lecturer at the

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,680
Sloan School of Management. But that

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,400
title does not do Phil justice. Phil is

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,279
an intellectual leader in corporate

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,760
innovation and an evangelist for

10
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,160
advancing the art and science of

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,559
corporate innovation both within MIT and

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,640
elsewhere. So I'm really looking forward

13
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,120
to what Phil has to say on this subject

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,000
and then to the interplay between Phil

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,640
and Fiona. So Dr. Phil, please take it

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,280
away.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,520
>> Well, thank you very much uh Dr. Ron. I

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,680
forgot you got your doctorate uh at the

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,760
end of the Cold War. And thank you, Ron,

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,520
and to our friends at ILP and corporate

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,399
relations here at MIT for pulling us

22
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,160
together for this uh fireside chat. And

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,399
thank you for all you participants who

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,480
are either uh joining us live. And

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,120
please do put things in the Q&A. I will

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,760
be sifting through those as part of the

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,280
upcoming fireside chat, but also welcome

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,000
to those of you out there who are

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,720
watching this uh recorded, possibly at

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,840
double speed. Um there are useful

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,920
insights in what Fiona has just shared

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,640
from the cutting edge worlds that she

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,040
inhabits of tech innovation. She

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,920
mentioned fusion but also the national

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,680
security area and she mentioned uh

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,159
conflict in Europe. I'll pick up a

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,720
little bit on that given her role um and

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,280
how these strands come together. But as

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,439
Ron kindly said, I'm very interested in

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,320
how leaders of large organizations,

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,640
primarily corporates, but also uh in the

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,880
public sector as well, think about how

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,520
to work in this world. And as Ron has

44
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,399
said, you know, for the last 35 odd

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,880
years, people especially in the west and

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,680
perhaps especially in America, were able

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,840
to separate out the geopolitics from the

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,759
economics. Anything could happen

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,719
anywhere as in Tom Freriedman's book,

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,560
The World is Flat. um other parts of the

51
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,640
world did not forget the interconnection

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,399
of politics and economics and

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,959
geopolitical power. But now in 2025 and

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,080
mid August, it's on everybody's agenda.

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,360
And I think it's great that we're

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,319
getting together in the middle of the

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,879
summer to feed into people's thinking as

58
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,120
the new term, the new financial quarter

59
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,200
comes along because you do need to be

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,200
planning on the geopolitical dimension

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,239
because it will affect your plans

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,440
whether you are in corporate strategy,

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,120
innovation, R&D. So I I thank Ron for

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,959
bringing us together. And let me just

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,120
check. Dame Fiona, are you ready for

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,519
some fireside chatting?

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,280
>> I am. I'd be very happy to answer

68
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,920
whatever questions that you or others

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,440
have.

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,879
>> Well, there's quite a few questions

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,720
coming in, but let me just pick up on

72
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,480
your wonderful presentation. Thank you

73
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,400
so much for pulling those various

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,879
strands together. Now, in the

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,720
introduction, it is clear that you are a

76
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,959
tenure professor here at MIT. You have

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,879
an engineering PhD. You've been

78
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,720
associate dean for innovation and

79
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,040
professor of entrepreneurship. But

80
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,280
you're now thinking about the

81
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,680
international security and geopolitical

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,680
dimensions. You mentioned Europe and you

83
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,040
mentioned NATO. So I wonder if you could

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,280
say a little bit about NIF which you are

85
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,440
now chairing so that people have a bit

86
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,440
of a context of what the NATO innovation

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,200
fund is doing and how it brings several

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,640
of these strand strands together.

89
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,640
>> Yes, thank you Phil. I'm very happy to

90
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,920
do that. So as Phil mentioned N is the

91
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,840
NATO innovation fund. Uh it's a it's one

92
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,239
of the first or the first multi-

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,159
sovereign venture capital uh funds. It

94
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,080
was established by NATO. Uh 24 of NATO

95
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,720
members have contributed as limited

96
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,040
partners. Uh and they've contributed to

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,560
a billion euro fund. And the fund

98
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,480
through independent investment

99
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,560
decision-making is investing in startups

100
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,480
largely sort of tapping into deep tech

101
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,400
dual use sorts of technologies that are

102
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,519
going to solve defense security and

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,720
resilience uh challenges that are faced

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,120
by the um billion people who live across

105
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,439
the NATO alliance. Now, part of the

106
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,840
fund's job is obviously to sort of

107
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,480
evangelize and and identify and invest

108
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,160
in commercial deals in in some of the

109
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,400
best companies that we can find across

110
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,040
those 24 nations, all of those in

111
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,720
Europe. Uh but we have two other jobs as

112
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,639
well. The first is to make sure that

113
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,040
those ideas are really adopted. And so

114
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,880
we have a very powerful uh sort of

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,720
mission platform group that is trying to

116
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,320
make sure that we help those companies

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,320
get into the doors of ministries of

118
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,680
defense and others so that all the

119
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,199
countries that have made this very

120
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,759
significant commitment to 5% GDP spend

121
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,600
um not only have the large prime

122
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,040
contractors to work with but also have

123
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,800
opportunities to work with these agile

124
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,160
uh you know ambitious scaleup ventures.

125
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,759
The other thing we're trying to do is

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,680
make sure that we in doing that we

127
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,080
really support innovation ecosystems

128
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,440
that are producing these companies not

129
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,720
just in uh the US but also in the United

130
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,400
Kingdom. So we've made some really

131
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,800
significant investments in London and

132
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,199
Oxford in Germany around Munich

133
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,960
companies like Issa Aerospace but also

134
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,360
across other parts of Europe to really

135
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,800
make sure we do that capacity building.

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,639
And the last thing I'd say because I

137
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,120
think this is incredibly relevant here

138
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,039
is that we want to make sure that our

139
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639
companies are protected. We worry very

140
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,440
deeply actually that particularly for

141
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,520
early stage innovation innovators.

142
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,680
Capital is not always as available as we

143
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,280
want it to be. Not everybody can kind of

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,120
walk into the door of a Silicon Valley

145
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,639
investor and kind of get the capital

146
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,400
that they need particularly when they're

147
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,160
doing something difficult. they're at

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,840
the frontier of innovation and

149
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,960
especially if the government is their is

150
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,280
their customer because we know

151
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,960
governments don't always work very fast

152
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,280
and when they are in this position of

153
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,919
financial vulnerability that's often the

154
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,560
moment when adversarial capital comes in

155
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,479
and so we spend a lot of time focusing

156
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,240
on protecting those companies making

157
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,240
sure that they are protected from some

158
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,120
of the adversarial intent of investors

159
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,960
and others um and so it's a it's

160
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,639
important part of the journey NATO has

161
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,680
absolutely sort of recognized that

162
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,199
innovation is is key and I think our

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,360
work and your work around innovation

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,840
ecosystems has informed that right from

165
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,600
the early days and the most interesting

166
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,759
piece of this is the move of the whole

167
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,800
innovation function in NATO into defense

168
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,639
investment because what it says is that

169
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,639
innovation is at the core of how we need

170
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,960
to be spending money and I think that's

171
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,960
an important signal that tells us that

172
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,880
governments and somewhere like NATO is

173
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,160
caught up with the private sector who

174
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,360
know that we need to invest in

175
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,720
innovation not just a nice to

176
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,960
Well, excellent. Well, thank you for

177
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,400
bringing all of your uh experience in

178
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,000
the world of this particular university

179
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,520
of MIT and putting it to play in in

180
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,160
NATO. So, NATO is facing off against

181
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,560
Russia. You mentioned US and and China.

182
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,960
That probably accounts for sort of 20%

183
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,560
of the population in the world. And so,

184
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,000
just having asked people while you were

185
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,440
doing your talk about where they were in

186
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,960
the world, it seems very globally

187
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,680
distributed.

188
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,759
um expanding out to the wider world. Do

189
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,319
you see these emerging innovation

190
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,720
ecosystems as just something in in the

191
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,560
west and Russia and China or do you see

192
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,880
the logics of these the logic of these

193
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,319
innovation ecosystems uh not only in

194
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,199
military and defense but in other areas

195
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,199
perhaps applying around the world?

196
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,960
>> Yes, absolutely. I mean I certainly and

197
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,880
as I've said in in the context of the

198
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,120
NATO Innovation Fund, we've been looking

199
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,039
at innovation ecosystems and and the

200
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
extraordinary entrepreneurial teams that

201
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,680
are emerging from those ecosystems

202
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,039
across Europe. Uh in the Nordics, we see

203
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,280
some very exciting and interesting

204
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,479
things happening. But as you and I both

205
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,400
know from the work that we've done

206
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,479
together with with RE, our regional

207
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,319
entrepreneurship acceleration program,

208
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,479
there are some quite powerful innovation

209
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,440
ecosystems in South America. Um

210
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,840
definitely in in Chile. uh our work with

211
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,360
Rio and particularly around sort of

212
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,319
clean tech and emerging technologies and

213
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,560
absolutely in um the Middle East in the

214
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,560
Gulf. very interesting work happening I

215
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,120
think in in Saudi and Riyad really sort

216
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,720
of building up that innovation ecosystem

217
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,160
uh and beginning to have that be very

218
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,599
much more focused on science and

219
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,479
technology as well as sort of more

220
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,039
digital activities and not to mention of

221
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,120
course you know the very very large and

222
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,599
important markets and market

223
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,400
opportunities um and innovation that

224
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,000
we're beginning to see in places like

225
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,000
Lagos Acra you know or in Egypt in Cairo

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
and elsewhere so absolutely I think this

227
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,240
is a global phenomenon. Um, it doesn't

228
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,240
always have the same flavor to it. And I

229
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,479
would say that the best ecosystems, as

230
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,719
you and I know, are the ones that are

231
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,240
often quite focused on a very particular

232
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,919
comparative advantage, things that

233
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
they're really good at. You know, think

234
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,839
of Nova Scotia, right, in their with

235
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,760
their ocean cluster, that sort of type

236
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,160
of expertise. And we're definitely

237
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,600
seeing that worldwide.

238
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,000
>> Interesting. Thank you for that. I put

239
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,240
the link to to Reap in there. So these

240
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,680
innovation ecosystems despite what Tom

241
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,920
Freriedman was trying to sell us 20

242
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,680
years ago are not evenly distributed.

243
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,160
They are happening in particular places

244
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,519
and we look separately at why those are.

245
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,440
I'm thinking about some of the corporate

246
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,080
leaders we've got here who are in global

247
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,279
industries and I just wonder uh as we've

248
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,959
been sort of talking about this over the

249
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,839
summer how you see the connection for

250
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,360
these very focused place-based place

251
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,680
specific innovation ecosystems to global

252
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,000
industrial sectors what governments call

253
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,560
the industrial base economists would

254
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
call industrial clusters. um why should

255
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,839
those who are operating in global

256
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,920
industries across supply chains and

257
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,800
value chains, why does this sort of very

258
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,360
geospecific innovation ecosystem logic

259
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,040
matter to them?

260
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,959
>> So look, I wonder let me let me use the

261
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,399
life science industry as a as a good

262
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,080
example of this, right? So the life

263
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,360
science sector is extraordinarily

264
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,760
global, absolutely important, right? our

265
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,120
health and well-being depends upon our

266
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,120
ability to to develop and and produce,

267
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,240
right, the new kinds of medicines that

268
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,920
are that are hugely important. Um, and

269
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,320
so you might argue that this was a quite

270
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,959
global industry and and has been for

271
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,600
many many years across sort of Europe,

272
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,240
in the United States, uh, production of

273
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,959
generic medicines in India and really a

274
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,200
growing life science sector in China.

275
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,040
But we also know that over the last 25

276
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,040
years, almost every single large

277
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,760
pharmaceutical company has come and set

278
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,720
up some sort of significant presence in

279
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,200
Boston because the innovation ecosystem

280
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,920
in the life sciences in Boston has been

281
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,920
a a global powerhouse. And so that is

282
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,360
the ecosystem logic at play that says

283
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,839
every single one of those companies

284
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,440
wants some sort of presence to tap into

285
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,240
the frontiers of knowledge whether

286
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,920
that's coming out of Harvard or MIT or

287
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,160
the medical school the hospitals

288
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,480
extraordinary startups that we see and

289
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,160
the very specialized risk capital and so

290
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,920
that's the sort of world kind of coming

291
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,640
to Boston

292
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,399
um on the other hand we know that those

293
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,000
companies very wisely have been very

294
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,000
globally distributed in where they

295
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,079
produce and increasingly have um

296
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,320
produced in China companies like Wooi

297
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,399
have been really important in making it

298
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,399
much more um economically efficient to

299
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,279
produce some of the biio medicines at

300
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,800
scale and yet there again the the sort

301
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,279
of the geography is going to kind of

302
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,120
come into play because you ask the

303
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,800
question well the government will has

304
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,800
had a recent executive order for the

305
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,920
United States to say actually we don't

306
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,839
want you to have that level of

307
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,720
vulnerability and so this sort of

308
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,279
globalized industrial uh sort of logic

309
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,800
is suddenly coming into question we're

310
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,160
having to start to really think about

311
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,279
how we do reshoring of production um

312
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,279
back to the US but also with allies and

313
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,880
of course if you're not in the US and if

314
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,279
your company is based for example in

315
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,720
Europe how you exactly think about those

316
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,880
relationships so it's not just

317
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,399
relationships and how you deal with

318
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,320
adversaries but how we deal with

319
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,320
partners how we partner what do we want

320
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,000
to be good at as a sovereign nation

321
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,920
versus what do we want to be good at as

322
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,560
a group of friends and allies I think is

323
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,320
a really important set of questions

324
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,480
>> excellent that ties in very nicely with

325
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,800
your point about the the geopolitical

326
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,160
calculus. A lot of corporate leaders for

327
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,639
the last couple of decades have just

328
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,399
been able to decide let's do things

329
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,639
where it's cheap or where they've got

330
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,200
access to certain things. And we'll come

331
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,040
on to minerals and rare earth in a bit.

332
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,519
Um but increasingly they need to factor

333
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,839
that into their geopolitical thinking.

334
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,839
Um given that we are both at MIT which

335
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,760
is a remarkable institute of technology

336
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,920
I want to talk a bit about some of the

337
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,680
emerging technologies that you see out

338
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,519
there and I know there's a question

339
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,279
about AI which is very much already with

340
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,720
us but I just wondered if you could with

341
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,639
your technology perspectives give us

342
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,560
perhaps a sense of what other people

343
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,200
should be thinking about as emerging

344
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,440
technologies what are the emerging areas

345
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,320
that perhaps could start to to change

346
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,240
things. I think 5 years ago uh we at MIT

347
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,560
might have talked about the coming AI

348
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,399
wave coming out of the labs and now by

349
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,399
2025 it's very much with us. It's

350
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,000
affecting business as usual. But just a

351
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,079
bit of a glimpse what do you see as a

352
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,680
professor here at MIT are the kinds of

353
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,920
thing things people should be thinking

354
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,399
about.

355
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,320
>> I think you're absolutely right that um

356
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,079
you know we might we might not see AI

357
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,600
and as the cutting edge in quite the

358
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,600
same way that we did five years ago.

359
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,519
although as as you I mean you make this

360
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,680
point I think better than I do that this

361
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:17,920
is not new and at MIT we've we've worked

362
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,680
on this for for decades um but certainly

363
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,680
there's a very interesting I think an

364
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,399
ongoing question about control of

365
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,320
innovation in AI control of some of the

366
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,639
foundational models whether each country

367
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,200
wants their own model um and the

368
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,279
dependency that that brings on massive

369
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,600
data centers and on energy and so very

370
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,800
quickly even when you're thinking about

371
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,120
something that perhaps is a little bit

372
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,720
more well-developed like AI, you get

373
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,800
straight into sort of data centers and

374
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,800
you get into energy security and that

375
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,720
puts us right back at the frontier of

376
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,959
asking the question whether it's to do

377
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,720
with fusion. I'm also particularly

378
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,880
interested in the next generation of

379
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,320
battery technology. I think there's a

380
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,959
really important set of questions to

381
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,800
understand as to whether or not

382
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,560
given that we have effectively lost the

383
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,880
race I think in lithium ion batteries

384
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,959
although they were um invented uh in the

385
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,160
in the US and sort of perfected in the

386
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,079
US and Japan and elsewhere um what what

387
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,160
about the next generation and so working

388
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,160
with our MIT colleague Yetman Chang

389
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,720
who's one of the leading experts in in

390
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,399
battery technology to really understand

391
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,240
that materials frontier um absolutely in

392
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,560
in sort of quantum computing

393
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,959
And you know there's definitely the race

394
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,399
is is sort of on um particularly in

395
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,480
China. I don't think we know exactly

396
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,440
what's going on there but we do know

397
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,040
that um researchers have spent time in

398
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,880
the US and particularly in Europe and

399
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,199
then taken much of that expertise back

400
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,199
to China and are now uh developing

401
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,600
extraordinary expertise. People might

402
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,519
say why do we care? Well um if we had

403
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,199
really effective quantum computers then

404
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,720
we could also decrypt all sorts of

405
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,120
interesting things. And so that goes

406
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,160
hand inhand I think with the frontier of

407
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,000
um postquantum encryption. So those are

408
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,000
some of the things I think we're we need

409
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,320
to be paying attention to. So uh and MIT

410
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,399
I think is working really hard on on

411
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,279
many of those things. But we absolutely

412
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,600
I think are seeing a world where

413
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,600
20 years ago on campus I'd say it was

414
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,120
all about software and the extraordinary

415
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,199
transformation of computer science.

416
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,880
Today, I think we're coming back to what

417
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,320
we would call deep tech, to things that

418
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,920
are often connected to the physical

419
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,480
world, the material science, the

420
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,880
chemistry, you know, the physics of it.

421
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,800
It's not just ones and zeros, it's atoms

422
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,920
as well. And as a former chemist and

423
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,600
engineer, that makes me extremely happy.

424
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,839
>> Excellent. Well, thank you for that uh

425
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,720
overview. in terms of emerging areas. I

426
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,000
love the fact that you're talking about

427
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,120
a variety of areas, batteries, quantum,

428
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,959
how AI is is used. Um, and also the

429
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,720
material world with with the deep tech.

430
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,000
I ask you a bit about uh critical

431
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,399
minerals. It turns out that while we

432
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,279
pretended not to care for 20 years where

433
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,600
semiconductors were made uh and where

434
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,600
the minerals were dug up and where they

435
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,920
were processed, it turns out we're

436
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,000
starting to care again. And so maybe

437
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,480
just to tie the sort of the geopolitics

438
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,160
of the minerals together with this deep

439
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,040
tech innovation that's coming out of the

440
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,839
the ecosystems. Do you see geopolitics

441
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,839
affecting where these these rare earths

442
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:20,480
are and where they're being processed?

443
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,800
>> So I mean absolutely. I mean geopolitics

444
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,240
can't quite affect where they are. Um

445
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,079
you know the earth's crust has sort of

446
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,920
been given to us as as it is. Um and yet

447
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,600
it it absolutely matters where they are

448
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,360
of course and and so we shouldn't be

449
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,199
surprised that we've seen recent maps of

450
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,759
Greenland I think in the news again

451
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,279
today or this last week maps of where

452
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,920
some of the critical minerals are in

453
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,639
Ukraine. Um they are a very very

454
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,199
important resource and access to those

455
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,360
resources absolutely matters um

456
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,680
particularly because they are powerful

457
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,839
inputs into a whole series of

458
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,480
extraordinary technologies. I've already

459
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,320
mentioned the role uh that some of the

460
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,000
high temperature superconducting tape

461
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,759
plays in fusion and there are some

462
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,559
really important rare earth inputs into

463
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,640
that tape. Rare earths are are important

464
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,160
in the semiconductor industry. Uh

465
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,559
they're extremely important in certain

466
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,079
kinds of battery technology um and so

467
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,400
on. And so you could sort of think about

468
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,240
mapping some of the absolutely frontier

469
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,760
industries to their dependencies on you

470
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,400
know things that we dig out the ground

471
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,839
in everywhere from sort of well we could

472
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,280
dig them out of the ground in Greenland

473
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,440
but we largely don't um to Ukraine to

474
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,960
Australia and also to China. What's

475
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,480
interesting about rare earths is in fact

476
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,320
the real bottleneck is not where they

477
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,559
are actually, it's about where they're

478
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,240
processed. And for many decades, we've

479
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,320
decided that the processing technology

480
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,200
was not particularly interesting and it

481
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,640
was very dirty. Um, you know, you take a

482
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,240
lot of rock, you grind it up, and you

483
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,240
sort of basically put a lot of acid over

484
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,360
it. And that is a is a pretty nasty

485
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,559
process. And it made sense then for

486
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,080
countries said, "Look, we don't want to

487
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,200
do that." And China said, "We don't

488
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,160
mind." And so China invested

489
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,720
significantly in processing both in

490
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,440
China and in Indonesia and elsewhere um

491
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,799
in parts of Africa which means that

492
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,039
regardless of whether we have control

493
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,640
over where these rare earths are, we

494
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,400
actually have to really think carefully

495
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,320
about whether we can use our innovation,

496
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,960
our private sector ingenuity to come up

497
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,720
with cleaner ways of extracting and

498
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,360
really be willing to actually do that

499
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,960
and make those investments

500
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,720
and make those investments in a way that

501
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,400
is connected into the whole value chain

502
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,559
of the end industries and so I think

503
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,559
it's a it's a really fascinating

504
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,320
industry to understand this our

505
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,280
colleague Elsa Oletti is obviously a

506
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,880
significant expert in this um but the

507
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,240
the sort of corporate perspective I know

508
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,000
Phil is one that you've been thinking

509
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,520
about so I mean what have you been

510
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,520
seeing in in this and how has that

511
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,039
debate changed from your point of view

512
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,840
if I'm allowed to turn the tables and

513
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,640
I'll

514
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,720
>> go you're the professor um well

515
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,799
fortunately Ron has made me smarter

516
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,679
about the minerals and the rare earth

517
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,520
elements

518
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,679
Um, I had not traditionally thought

519
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,440
about them. Um, and yet it really

520
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,919
matters for me as a former diplomat, you

521
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,520
know, where they are in the world. And,

522
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,000
uh, this is being recorded on the

523
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,919
Thursday ahead of the Trump Putin

524
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
discussions tomorrow. So, those watching

525
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,919
this later will know how that sequence

526
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
turns out. It turns out people care

527
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,360
where the minerals are. And you're

528
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,720
right, they they are where they are.

529
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,400
It's a question of how they can get them

530
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,480
out of the ground. But also, you know,

531
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,640
our very important mining industry

532
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,760
doesn't always find it easy to extract

533
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,600
them in some of the jurisdictions that

534
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,880
uh loves having the technologies but

535
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,679
doesn't necessarily want to have the

536
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,600
mine there. And so I think the

537
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,679
corporates need to play in that

538
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,080
multistakeholder space as the world

539
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,960
changes to make the case why they need

540
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,760
to be able to extract the minerals but

541
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,160
also process them uh without supply

542
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,160
chains having to cut across certain

543
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,000
international borders that uh could

544
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,799
become problematic in the near future.

545
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,799
And I I mentioned reap for the eagleeyed

546
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,160
ones. You will see that we've had in the

547
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:00,400
before times we had teams from uh China

548
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,160
and Russia. And so we have a bit of an

549
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,840
understanding what's going on there. And

550
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,240
yet with the new geopolitical

551
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,000
fragmentation, corporate leaders and

552
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,600
strategists will need to think about

553
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,400
where are they sourcing things whether

554
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:16,080
it's minerals or semiconductors and just

555
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,840
have that geopolitical uh calculus.

556
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,280
Can I just add? So I think one of the

557
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,120
things that makes this quite hard is

558
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,600
that at the moment um

559
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,600
a number of governments, US government,

560
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,640
UK, European governments, I think

561
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,960
increasingly recognize the vulnerability

562
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:36,640
of production of supply chains of some

563
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,120
of these critical inputs, but and they

564
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,559
talk quite a lot about it. And so as a

565
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,880
corporate leader, you know, I want to

566
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,720
factor that into my calculus as as we've

567
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,640
been talking about. But at the moment

568
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,240
they often don't price it. And so

569
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,240
they're not willing necessarily to pay

570
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,480
extra for something that has been

571
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,320
sourced, you know, from a friendly

572
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,799
nation or from somewhere that is a much

573
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,919
more reliable source that is less likely

574
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,360
to be subject to embargo and so on. Um

575
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,559
we're beginning to see a little bit of a

576
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,559
shift. And so we saw this with um the US

577
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,840
basically making a particular commitment

578
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,679
to um a US mining company and having a

579
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,200
sort of a floor price on their offset.

580
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,600
And so we are beginning to see that.

581
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,799
We're beginning to see resilience,

582
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,200
sovereignty, control being priced by

583
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,039
governments. And I think that will,

584
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,880
interestingly, that will make it much

585
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,760
easier for for corporate leaders because

586
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,799
at the moment, I think we want to do the

587
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,840
right thing. We want to give good

588
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,159
advice. We want to have the right

589
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,760
boardroom discussions, but it's quite

590
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,520
hard to tell whether or not these are

591
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,120
nice to have on the part of governments

592
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,919
or things that they will ultimately

593
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,559
either regulate or price. And so I think

594
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,200
there's a very interesting set of sort

595
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,720
of discussions but it does mean that uh

596
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,000
keeping an eye on that is going to be

597
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,000
important.

598
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,520
>> No, it really is. And I I see a question

599
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,840
I'm going to move on to the space

600
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,440
industry in a moment and but just to

601
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,000
pick up on that I think this is why

602
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,400
those who are involved in business doing

603
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,480
MBAs being corporate leaders need to

604
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,480
think about this because in this global

605
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,320
competition the relationship between

606
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,440
states and markets is different in

607
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,760
different countries, different

608
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,080
jurisdictions. some can manipulate

609
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,600
markets for geopolitical effect. I think

610
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,520
one of our strengths in what used to be

611
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,000
called the west is that we have fairly

612
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,799
free and open markets. So thinking about

613
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,960
how can we help uh economic actors,

614
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,039
corporate leaders to play through that

615
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,919
what is the role of the price discovery,

616
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,280
price mechanisms uh and I I hope that'll

617
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,360
be something that we can continue to

618
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,600
come back to. But somebody asked about

619
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,919
space and so you can either take the

620
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,240
space race to Mars, you can take the low

621
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,080
earth orbits but I know from both your

622
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,919
studies, your NATO work and a variety of

623
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,760
boards that you sit on. How would you

624
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,080
talk about space in this geopolitical

625
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,280
area?

626
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,880
>> I mean look I think there are a number

627
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,559
of obviously there are sort of different

628
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,240
layers and one can think about the space

629
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,240
economy I think as one that is is

630
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,400
obviously profoundly important. I mean

631
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,840
if we start with just space launch I

632
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,280
think that is perhaps one of the most

633
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,679
essential pieces of having a space

634
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,120
economy. We've got to get stuff up into

635
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:07,600
space and you know increasingly we have

636
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,280
been and and many of our companies our

637
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,760
countries have been very reliant on

638
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,320
SpaceX. Now that's a fascinating example

639
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,559
of a shift from having these large

640
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,080
audacious innovation projects happening

641
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,320
um being done by governments by

642
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,000
organization like NASA and now being in

643
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,480
the hands of the private sector and and

644
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,320
using all that private sector ingenuity

645
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,760
and that I think has been a very very

646
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,080
important lesson and I think has sort of

647
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,559
forged the path for us relying on

648
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,559
entrepreneurial ventures to be some of

649
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,080
the leading innovators. But of course,

650
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,919
if I'm sitting outside of the United

651
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,320
States, I might ask myself, do I want to

652
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,360
be that reliant on a specific country

653
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,799
and a very specific company? Um, and so

654
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,720
what we're beginning to see, and we see

655
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:52,320
this through the NATO Innovation Fund,

656
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,960
is real efforts to um develop new space

657
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,960
launched capabilities um in other

658
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,039
countries. We've seen we've made an

659
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,760
investment in ISSa Aerospace, which is a

660
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,960
German um space launch company. And

661
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,280
interestingly, they are doing their

662
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,440
physical launches in the Andoya Space

663
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,520
Center, which is up on the west coast of

664
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,840
Norway, right up in in sort of the high

665
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,080
north above the Arctic Circle. I had the

666
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,159
privilege of going to visit um not very

667
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,000
long ago, and you recognize a big

668
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,480
investment by the Norwegian government

669
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,480
in having that space launch capability.

670
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,880
Think of that as a very powerful asset

671
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,960
for the nation that they can use as part

672
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,720
of collaboration with other like-minded

673
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,039
nations. And so we definitely see I

674
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,480
think a growing market but also a

675
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,039
recognition that we don't want sort of

676
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,559
monopoly of one country or one company

677
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,919
over that. So that would just be sort of

678
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,919
launch. I think when it comes to

679
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,919
satellites you see the same thing. I

680
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,640
think people not necessarily wanting

681
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,400
sole reliance on one particular company

682
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,159
whether it's Starlink or anybody else

683
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,080
just because that gives a very hefty

684
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,000
amount of control and latitude of action

685
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,320
to that one company. So I think we're

686
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,159
beginning to see um sort of more

687
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,760
different opportunities from different

688
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,000
countries. Again, I think that's going

689
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,840
to change the structure of industry.

690
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,600
>> When it comes to Mars or the moon, you

691
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,279
know, look, I I do think that there's

692
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,799
discussions about we get back to

693
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,799
critical minerals. There's discussions

694
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,440
of are we going to mine the deep seabed?

695
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,360
Are we going to mine on on the moon?

696
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,960
There's some really serious discussion

697
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,480
at the moment. I think China and Russia

698
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,600
have made a commitment to put a nuclear

699
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,720
reactor on the moon by um I think 2030

700
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,159
or 2032. Will the US do likewise? And so

701
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,159
I do think that that is going to be a

702
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,919
new terrain for geopolitics.

703
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,520
>> Look, it's one that I find quite

704
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,720
troubling. I I um I don't know whether

705
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,640
this is just me or whether it's just

706
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,000
because I'm a girl. I I sort of think we

707
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,480
should sometimes leave our planets

708
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,240
alone. I'm not very fond of the idea of

709
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,720
terraforming Mars, but that just makes

710
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,279
me um you know, old-fashioned, I think,

711
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,279
probably. Well, no. I think it's uh I

712
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,799
think it's important to be cautious uh

713
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,159
about these things and and have

714
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,480
discussions even at a time of

715
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,559
geopolitical fragmentation. I think it's

716
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,720
important to have uh international

717
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:59,200
discussions and and communication was

718
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,400
one of the the topics um out there and

719
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,360
it ties into a little bit um with the

720
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,120
the US not being so open to some of the

721
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,200
international talent that has

722
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,760
traditionally come here to to the United

723
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,600
States. Do you see opportunities out

724
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,360
there for other parts of the world to

725
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,600
think through, you know, you mentioned

726
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,320
the German company in Norway? Are there

727
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,240
parts of the wider world, formerly the

728
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,840
the the

729
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,000
developing world, some call it the

730
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,520
global south. Are there ways with the

731
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,200
way that innovation and technology is

732
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,720
playing out for others to try and

733
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,039
specialize with their innovation and

734
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,799
their industries?

735
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,720
So I absolutely think that there are

736
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,159
huge opportunities for different

737
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,600
countries, different regions to

738
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,039
specialize. Um and you know we see this

739
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,880
quantum computing is actually a really

740
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,400
interesting area where we've seen

741
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,120
something that is not just that's not

742
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,640
just a US being in the lead nor China.

743
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,880
We see extraordinary leadership on the

744
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,640
part of the UK um but increasingly in

745
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,880
Denmark for example very large

746
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,880
commitments uh by the governments in

747
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,120
some of these countries. when it comes

748
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,799
to things like space technology, we've

749
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,320
seen the UAE, you know, being really

750
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,640
quite forwardleaning when it comes to

751
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,240
sort of space space launch and and um

752
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,640
space technology, which I think is a

753
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,640
very interesting piece for me. What that

754
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,640
means is it's not just a a willingness

755
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,480
to attract global talent and to perhaps

756
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,480
use the fact that the the sort of the

757
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,720
magnetic attraction of America's very

758
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,120
very leading academic institutions, you

759
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,960
know, MIT included, is more complex

760
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,480
today. And so that does mean that

761
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,960
perhaps there are opportunities for

762
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,679
other places, but really building up

763
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,360
that ability to educate at the highest

764
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,200
level, do research at the frontier of

765
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,120
knowledge is a long-term commitment. And

766
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,960
so as countries think about that and

767
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,679
make sure their universities are fit for

768
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,440
purpose and focused more specialized

769
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,080
than I think would be traditionally the

770
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,000
advice that they would um sort of be

771
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,480
given or have for themselves. The the

772
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,159
mental model um is a long-term

773
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,080
commitment. It's not something that we

774
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,240
can they can do for sort of two years

775
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,240
and say well oh we've changed our mind.

776
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,080
Um the places that have absolutely built

777
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,600
these sort of the new worldclass

778
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,159
institutions and think you know

779
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,000
Singapore or elsewhere have been doing

780
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,679
that for decades and have made that

781
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,600
long-term commitment not just to

782
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,919
education but also the the research

783
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,360
training. But I'm incredibly hopeful and

784
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,840
again we've seen this with some of our

785
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,520
regions in reap particularly in the Gulf

786
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,919
and elsewhere where there is funding

787
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,399
available to make to make that

788
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,559
commitment. And so perhaps the next

789
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,960
generation of talent will move more

790
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,360
seamlessly backwards and forwards come

791
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,880
to the US. I'm I'm hopeful because we

792
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,480
benefit so much from having global

793
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,240
talent on our campus. I mean, what a

794
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,159
pleasure to walk into a classroom and

795
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,919
hear so many different accents. You

796
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,159
know, I think as professors, we're not

797
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,240
unusual in not sounding as if we were

798
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,760
born in the United States. And so this

799
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,559
is something that our faculty has always

800
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,559
been so global. Um, and I'm hopeful that

801
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,120
that will continue to be true, but we

802
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,880
have to be extremely careful because we

803
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,279
are developing things that are of

804
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,640
significant national and international

805
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,960
importance. And I think we have to

806
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,960
protect those ideas.

807
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,679
>> Well, that's great. I'm going to shift

808
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,880
on to the energy transition uh after a

809
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,880
quick comment on the international

810
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,919
talent because I think corporate leaders

811
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,880
have a role to play with this as well.

812
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,480
uh you know, wherever they're

813
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,760
headquartered, they can definitely lean

814
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,480
into opportunities to improve the local

815
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,919
uh skills and talent, which can give

816
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,760
them competitive advantage in the

817
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,159
markets they're in. But as we see here

818
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,559
in Boston, quite a few corporates also

819
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,679
spend their people here. Uh it's worth

820
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:32,000
dropping into innovation ecosystems to

821
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,919
get a glance at the future. uh some of

822
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,679
the great ILP events bring out some of

823
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,559
the best MIT professors to talk about

824
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:42,159
you know cutting edge quantum fusion

825
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:44,240
cyber security postquantum decryption um

826
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,240
or webinars if you can't get here but I

827
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,440
think there are various ecosystems

828
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,200
around the world and it's worth

829
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,679
corporates thinking about putting some

830
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:56,000
people in them to get glances at the the

831
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,919
future one of which is on um the energy

832
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,399
transition which some look at through a

833
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,240
decarbonization perspective others

834
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,559
through how do we make our way from

835
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,159
traditional hydrocarbons to other

836
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,799
approaches and just this week we've had

837
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,679
an amazing Saudi delegation startups in

838
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:13,600
the environment space from that ministry

839
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,840
a country that is definitely leaning

840
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,760
into to that transition I was wondering

841
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,679
if you could say how does the energy

842
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,919
transition look from a geopolitical

843
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,679
perspective is that changing things and

844
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,919
are there a role for not only the big

845
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,679
corporates the sort of oil majors but

846
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,399
also for startups as we think about

847
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,559
future energies

848
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,159
>> so I I think the energy transition

849
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,679
certainly has you know a very

850
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,120
significant sort of geopolitical

851
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,919
dimension and again I think that

852
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,760
geopolitical calculus is increasingly

853
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,279
important both for the startups and the

854
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,440
large corporations and I hope the

855
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,679
partnership between the two I mean just

856
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,840
to sort of put it in the most I think

857
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,600
the starkkest terms is that part of that

858
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,640
transition the transition to electric

859
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,200
vehicles has been built on the back of

860
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,279
you know massive availability and huge

861
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,799
sort of reduction you know in the cost

862
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,399
curve of batteries and that has come

863
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,799
from the economies of scale and scope

864
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:10,159
that have been had by PE companies like

865
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:13,039
BYD and CL in China. And so on the one

866
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,520
hand we have the extraordinary ability

867
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,120
to make much lower cost uh lithiumion

868
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,279
battery technology but on the other hand

869
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,399
that provides both huge economic

870
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,240
benefits to China um through a very very

871
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,880
long-term investments in those companies

872
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,480
and uh significant strategic dependency.

873
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,799
And so I think as we think about the

874
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,360
next generation of energy transition

875
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,880
technologies um whether that be actually

876
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,039
the energy transition that we're going

877
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,919
to need to power what we might do in the

878
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,720
space economy uh for electric aviation

879
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,640
for example or say gridscale storage

880
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,480
there's some areas where we think there

881
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,799
might be real opportunities for for

882
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,000
example US or European or other

883
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,360
ingenuity and innovation ecosystems. I

884
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,200
think the thing we have to try to make

885
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,720
sure of this time is to have an

886
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,000
industrial policy to have that sort of

887
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,600
economic statecraft that allows for us

888
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,919
to hold and own more of that

889
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,679
industrialization. And that I think is

890
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,760
going to be the the debate if you like

891
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,600
or the back and forth between the

892
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,919
startups and the large corporations in

893
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,120
the energy transition is how those large

894
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,360
corporates will use their balance

895
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,200
sheets, how Wall Street will think about

896
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,360
them. And so we haven't said very much

897
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,159
about the capital markets but of course

898
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,159
for any one of these decisions that sort

899
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,679
of any boardroom decision which is a

900
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,039
decision being made in the shadow of a

901
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,960
belief about what your investors are

902
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,480
going to think about it. So really

903
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,200
understanding where the capital markets

904
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,919
are with respect to how much they value

905
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,000
um you know sort of investments in

906
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,399
resilience how much value is given to

907
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,399
sort of having less geopolitical

908
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,519
vulnerability in your supply chain. I

909
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,760
think it's going to be the capital

910
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,159
market response that's going to be quite

911
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,080
important to this energy transition both

912
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,480
in the private capital when it comes to

913
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,919
investors and in the public capital with

914
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,240
the with the capital markets for the

915
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,799
large corporates. But I think we're

916
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,120
going to see both hugely important next

917
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:04,080
generation technologies and we continue

918
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,159
to and the energy transition I think is

919
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,159
exactly the place where the ecosystems

920
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,399
embedded in this sort of industrialized

921
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,919
sort of global clusters these

922
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,120
geopolitical questions are going to come

923
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,960
to a head um and I think there's so much

924
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,559
work to be done so I'm really

925
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,399
>> I'm always very delighted when we have

926
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:22,080
teams in our reap program for whom this

927
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,559
is their focal activity and they're

928
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,919
asking the question can we be an expert

929
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,039
in this particular particular piece of

930
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,600
it, you know, are we going to be

931
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,120
extraordinarily good at sort of solar or

932
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,240
something else? I think very very

933
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,919
important.

934
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,200
>> No, I I think that's great. I love tying

935
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,760
that into your point about, you know, I

936
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,120
think there are going to be

937
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,200
opportunities around the world coming

938
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,720
out of innovation ecosystems, coming out

939
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,279
of parts of the world where our

940
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,960
listeners today are are from. Um, as we

941
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,640
move into the final uh minute or so

942
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,159
before I hand back to Ron, he very

943
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,120
kindly mentioned you'd written a book.

944
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,039
Could you say something about that?

945
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,600
>> Um, I think actually you wrote a book

946
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,519
and I helped. Um it was you know really

947
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,480
a pleasure I think to take the work that

948
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,720
we have been teaching um in our classes

949
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,519
about innovation ecosystems to our MBA

950
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,200
students our mid-career executives um

951
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,599
take some of the material that we've

952
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,760
been working uh with leaders in regions

953
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,839
around the world those five uh

954
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,919
stakeholders uh working with corporate

955
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,359
leaders in particular government leaders

956
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,839
and really sort of putting all that

957
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,520
together and saying no if you want to

958
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,320
accelerate innovation in your large

959
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,240
organization how can you How should you

960
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,480
work with innovation ecosystems around

961
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,000
the world? You know, what do you want to

962
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,399
do that for? What's the strategic

963
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,919
imperative? Who do you want to talk to?

964
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,639
And how are you going to do that? And

965
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:38,320
it's been a real pleasure to um you

966
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,760
know, put all those ideas together and

967
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,079
actually have that discipline of writing

968
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,320
it all down sort of in a book so that

969
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,119
those ideas can can kind of be put

970
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,359
together all in one place. And so, um I

971
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,040
hope that people find it helpful. It

972
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,280
absolutely is aimed at the corporate and

973
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,919
government leader. And so it's brilliant

974
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,440
to share that with this audience and um

975
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,680
we should say thank you to you for it

976
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,000
was your idea to put it all together.

977
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,359
>> Well, it was a team effort and I see

978
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
links to that and our corporate

979
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,119
innovation work uh are there. Fiona, as

980
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,280
we wrap up and um prepare to return to

981
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,200
Ron, thank you so much for taking time.

982
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,560
We have worked so closely on corporate

983
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,800
innovation and now we got this new

984
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,880
geopolitical dimension. I know uh

985
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,920
there's going to be an ILP event in

986
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,359
October um which we can pick up with

987
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,280
these conversations in that globally

988
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,240
relevant city, but let me give you the

989
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,839
last word and then Ron can take over.

990
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,440
Well, I just want to say thank you and

991
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:34,480
I'm incredibly appreciative of having

992
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,800
the chance to uh talk about this um sort

993
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,640
of the role of of geopolitics and this

994
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,720
idea that we need to have a geopolitical

995
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,040
calculus in our boardrooms and our

996
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,480
investment um committees, you know, in

997
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,720
all the places that we're making these

998
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,440
essential economic decisions. We need

999
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,720
that uh geopolitical calculus as a lens

1000
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,920
over um our innovation activities. Thank

1001
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,920
you very much.
