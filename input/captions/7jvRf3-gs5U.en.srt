00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,920
hi there I hope you were able to take a

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,760
couple minutes to think about how you

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,119
might represent pitch I'm back better

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,760
camera hopefully a little bit better so

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,560
what are the consequences of the pitch

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,279
representation that we might

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,519
choose that's what we're going to be

8
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:36,280
looking at now let's say that we decide

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,600
to work with the numeric representation

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,039
P equal

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,559
440 how would we represent then a type

12
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,559
of continuous pitch like

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,840
aando since we only have one number or

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,760
even just thinking about the performance

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,359
perspective how do we represent how do

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,840
we go from a number like 440 into

17
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,160
something that a performer would be able

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,320
to see on a staff and play with and are

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,200
we just going to have a whole series of

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,080
numbers so maybe the string based thing

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,280
will be a little bit better but then how

22
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,920
do we manipulate it what does p+2 mean

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,960
are we just going to have a whole bunch

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,439
of python errors that we can never add

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,680
things together that

26
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:26,759
way so what we're going to be thinking

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,200
about in the first group discussion is

28
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,079
what are the

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,920
consequences of the particular

30
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:37,119
representations that we

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,920
choose other words what kinds of

32
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,960
applications can be done with a

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,560
particular representation that can't be

34
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,079
done with another

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:51,920
representation another way of putting it

36
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:55,920
is which stakeholders are included or in

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,920
excluded depending on our

38
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,560
representation so the next thing I'd

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,320
like you to do is to

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,759
think of three different ways that you

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,360
might represent pitch on a computer and

42
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,640
then think about for each of those what

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,879
does this way do well and what does this

44
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:18,040
way do badly at and then think about the

45
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:20,519
stakeholders a stakeholder might be a

46
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,480
musician or it might be a programmer or

47
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,120
it might be

48
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,280
a a a record producer or it might be

49
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,200
somebody who is more specific like uh a

50
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,480
rock music verus a clal musician or

51
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,879
something of that s and who are the

52
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,480
stakeholders who are excluded or

53
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,480
included by what you've done
