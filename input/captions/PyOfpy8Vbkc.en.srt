1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,800
All right, let's start

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,880
from first category. Uh, advanced

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,880
diagnostics. Professor Angela Basha. She

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,960
is James Mason Craft Professor and

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,359
Professor at Department of Biological

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,359
Engineering, Material Science and Coke

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,600
Institute for Integrative Cancer

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,119
Research and the head of department of

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,279
biological engineering at MIT. She is a

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,160
expert in the field of biioaterial,

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,559
biomolecular material, organic inorganic

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,640
interface and solid state chemistry. Uh

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,239
she will speak about interesting you

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,360
know his research history today. I think

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,680
she was awarded 2024 national medal of

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,920
science and technology. Professor Angel

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,239
Bashar lead research focused on

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,079
understanding and harnessing nature's

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,440
own process in order to design

20
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,840
technologically important material and

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,439
device for energy and environment and

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,479
medicine. So she will present near

23
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:11,280
infrared imaging sensing probes for

24
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:14,000
imaging small size tumors. She also

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,799
found a startup for noninvasive optical

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,720
imaging system as well. So I will hand

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,119
over to Angela. So, please welcome.

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,759
Good morning. Um, it's nice to be here.

29
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,159
Um, I'm always excited to be here, um,

30
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,479
for lots of different reasons. Um, but

31
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,079
it's really great to interact with, um,

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,840
with people and companies that are

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,920
trying to make an impact in the world

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,920
and make an impact on people's lives.

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,880
And, um, I'm in the department of

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,560
biological engineering here at MIT and,

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,560
uh, the materials science and

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,640
engineering and the Koch Institute. But,

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,159
I'm really an inventor. Um, I've wanted

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
to be an inventor since I was four years

41
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,200
old. Um, and my my group that's what we

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,960
do. We uh we're inventors and we we like

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,880
to invent um problems and and um around

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,560
bottlenecks that we can think can make

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,719
an impact uh in the world and we work

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,719
with a lot of of partners on this. And

47
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,240
so um unfortunately right after this I

48
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,920
have to teach at 10 o'clock on the other

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,679
side of campus. So I'm going to be

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,440
running but I can come back if you want

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,160
to talk. It's the last class. I can't

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,760
bail on the students. Um but um we can

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,440
talk in in more more detail. Um and I

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,239
have way too ambitious of a slide

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,040
presentation today. Um but so I've been

56
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,760
fascinated um almost my entire life on

57
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,520
how organisms make materials. Here's an

58
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,040
example of an abalone shell, which is a

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,280
biomposite material. It's 98% by mass

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,239
calcium carbonate, but 2% by mass

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,560
proteins. Yet it's 3,000 times tougher

62
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,640
than its geologic counterpart. So I'm

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,360
going to pass this around. This is how

64
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,519
biology makes calcium carbonate. It made

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,120
it in the ocean. Ocean temperatures,

66
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,040
ocean pressures, doesn't use toxic

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,640
materials, doesn't add toxic materials

68
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,959
back into the environment. I'm going to

69
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,120
pass it this

70
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,720
way. Um, over here are geological

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,920
counterparts of calcium carbonate. You

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,480
might have seen this before. This is

73
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,640
calite, the the thermodynamically most

74
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,400
favored structure of calcium carbonate.

75
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,319
Don't drop it because it's like $150 and

76
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
it's very for me it's very valuable. But

77
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,840
if you look at it in the right, you can

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,360
see that it's actually optically active.

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,519
It's pretty cool. And this is the

80
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,239
metastable crystal structure of calcium

81
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,080
carbonate. And um the organisms in the

82
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,720
ocean pick both of those structures

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,480
simultaneously to work with um and they

84
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,720
control it. How many people are solid

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,040
state chemistry? Okay. Yes. Solid state

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,599
chemistry. Um so you know from if you

87
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,640
think about the

88
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,080
um phase diagram, you're usually

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,080
thinking, oh yes, temperature or

90
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
pressure. But organisms have another

91
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,280
very special thing which many people are

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,959
in the life sciences and biological

93
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,280
sciences so they know this but they can

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,519
use proteins to control crystalraphic

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,360
orientation. They can use proteins to to

96
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,760
make things nanocale. They can use

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,920
proteins to control optical electronic

98
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,280
prop well yes electronic properties. We

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,040
can use them to control electronic

100
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,280
properties. And so it's just amazing. So

101
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,879
these organisms evolved over billions of

102
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,400
years in the ocean to take calcium

103
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,560
carbonate out of the environment and

104
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
build exquisite structures. Okay. Are we

105
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,239
limited to that? No. So, I passed out a

106
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,840
periodic table for you today. Um, it's a

107
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,680
periodic table that I made after I got

108
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,640
to MIT. I wasn't here that long. It

109
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,080
says, "Welcome to MIT nun element, and

110
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,479
that's because when I got here, I felt

111
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,639
like I finally fit in." Um, and so it's

112
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,720
the periodic table on one side, and it's

113
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,320
the amino acids and their pKa's on the

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,520
other side because I'm fascinated

115
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,320
between this this interface between

116
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,560
biology and and um the periodic table.

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,479
How can you use those together to to

118
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,840
make materials? And so I'm here to talk

119
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,600
about ovarian cancer, but I'm going to

120
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,040
talk a little bit about things before

121
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,360
that. So um I wanted to mention uh two

122
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,880
of my uh collaborators, Professor Paula

123
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Hammond in chemical engineering

124
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,160
institute professor and um professor

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,680
Sangita Batia. the the um the three of

126
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,160
us are are just dedicated to changing

127
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,919
the outcome of uh women living with

128
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,919
ovarian cancer, hopefully prevent

129
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,840
ovarian cancer, intercept ovarian

130
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,840
cancer. Um and um uh and I'll talk about

131
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,680
that uh that today. We're all holding

132
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,919
signs to say I look like an engineer.

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,080
We're part of a campaign to re um we

134
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,000
were part of a campaign to re um imagine

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,680
what engineers look like. I mentioned

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,560
before that organisms in the ocean have

137
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
been doing a fantastic job of making

138
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,800
nanomaterials for about three billion

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,960
years. Um, and they do this by uh

140
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,280
evolution, by controlling proteins. What

141
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,800
my lab did that was was different was we

142
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,000
said, "Okay, life has done a pretty good

143
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,280
job, but we think it could have done

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,280
better. What if it had the whole

145
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,680
periodic table to work with? What if it

146
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,759
wasn't limited to the ions that were

147
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,680
dissolved in the ocean?" And so we

148
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,680
developed some te technology and that's

149
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,960
part of what I I won the the national

150
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,440
medal for was can you force organisms to

151
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,360
work with the whole periodic table. Um

152
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,199
and uh you're saying no I don't think

153
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,479
you can and I agree with you you

154
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,240
probably can't force them to work with

155
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,360
every element on the periodic table but

156
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,880
can you get them to work with most

157
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,479
elements on the periodic table?

158
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,240
Absolutely. Can you get them to

159
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,600
genetically code it? And we've worked on

160
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,479
about 150 materials now that we can grow

161
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,880
um using biological mechanisms. We use

162
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,639
bacteria phages. We use proteins. We use

163
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,639
antibodies. We use yeast cells. Um I'll

164
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,000
pass around two different um batteries

165
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,199
that we made in my lab. These are

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,280
batteries that are genetically

167
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,199
engineered. Um we engineered organisms

168
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,880
to make the anode and the cathode wire

169
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,800
itself to the current collector. This

170
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,360
one went to the White House several

171
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,199
years ago for a press release. That I'll

172
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,039
pass that one this way. I I can't

173
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,280
remember. That's probably a lithium iron

174
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,639
phosphate battery. This is a a battery

175
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,160
that the technology wasn't that

176
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,080
difficult. We translated it to my

177
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,600
undergraduate teaching lab um sophomore

178
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,880
level and these are batteries that they

179
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,560
made. You're saying, "Wait a minute,

180
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,039
that looks just like my battery that you

181
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,440
know is in my um remote control or

182
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,960
something." Um yeah, it's the the bi the

183
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,639
battery, the anode, the cathode

184
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,080
materials are made biologically, but

185
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,840
then we package them as a regular

186
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,000
battery technology. So yeah, you can

187
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,440
actually work on batteries, solar cells,

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,280
fuel cells, and we've done that kind of

189
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,759
thing in the lab. So you can genetically

190
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,440
engineer simple organisms to do things

191
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,440
like make a make a battery. And you're

192
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,680
like, why would you do that? Well, one,

193
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,840
because it's cool. Um the the other

194
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,680
reason is that biology when it made that

195
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,360
shell, it does it at uh ocean

196
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,960
temperatures, ocean pressures, doesn't

197
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,319
use toxic materials, doesn't add toxic

198
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,280
materials back in the environment, just

199
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,520
like my cell phone, right? No. So, the

200
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,680
idea is can you use this these kinds of

201
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,759
processing to control things? And the

202
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,599
other key is evolution. So, through

203
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,000
evolution, even if you make come kind of

204
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,440
a not so great battery, you can evolve

205
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,639
it over time to try to make it better

206
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,160
and better. We've done that with with

207
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,240
many materials and I I'm not sure if I

208
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,160
already said we've worked with over 150

209
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,039
materials. So in my lab we work at the

210
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,000
interface between nanotechnology and

211
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,319
biomeaterials and I always say I've

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,960
never been accused of focusing um

213
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,199
because we work on energy healthcare and

214
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,680
the environment um and the connection

215
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,800
there to us is nanomaterials

216
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,479
um making uh nice nanomaterials um that

217
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,879
can um can be used for many different um

218
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,879
applications. And we've spun out um five

219
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,639
companies in my lab in different areas

220
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,960
anywhere from uh electronics to uh to

221
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:09,280
energy. Um uh Sision Vision I'll show

222
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,759
you a little data with now. It's u a

223
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,080
company doing um non-invasive imaging of

224
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,639
of lymph nodes. It's now in 15 uh

225
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,759
hospitals around the um around the world

226
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,720
actually. Um and uh other other

227
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,240
technologies as as well. Um this this

228
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,840
these are just inventions that we've

229
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,080
done very very recently that I don't

230
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,599
have time to talk about. Um but um we've

231
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,919
um well I can talk a little bit about

232
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,680
it. Okay. So um these are materials here

233
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,120
that we engineered. U we thought these

234
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,560
are going to be great battery materials.

235
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,720
These are really high surface area

236
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:47,440
carbons on the order of 15 or 16 um um

237
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,399
uh these are on the order of 15 or uh uh

238
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,080
16 me squared per gram. Um says 18 here.

239
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,080
18 meters squared per gram. We've now

240
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,360
grown them up to 7,000 meters squared

241
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,959
per gram. Very high surface area

242
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,240
materials. These materials we made from

243
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,160
batteries. They did not work for

244
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,480
batteries. We found out that they could

245
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,640
actually neutralize um really toxic

246
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,320
agents. We translated them to the US

247
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,120
Army where they used them to neutralize

248
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:13,680
chemical warfare agents sin and sarin uh

249
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:16,720
to protect uh troops. Um and um then we

250
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,560
actually translated those materials into

251
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,920
u materials that could be used for gold

252
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,760
mining. um and uh that were magnetic and

253
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,760
could be used for gold mining. And we

254
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,519
translated um the materials that are on

255
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,600
the order of 7,000 meters squared per

256
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,080
gram as materials to clean up forever

257
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,720
chemicals and other toxic chemicals in

258
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,680
the water. So what we try to do is just

259
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:42,120
make materials and try to fit that into

260
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:45,120
um a place where um where there's a

261
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,839
need. So why ovarian cancer? So, I've

262
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,560
become obsessed with uh ovarian cancer

263
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,959
um partly because of um of knowing

264
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,160
several women at NMIT that that died of

265
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,480
ovarian cancer. Um and one woman is

266
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,000
diagnosed in stage three or stage four

267
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,800
ovarian cancer every three minutes

268
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,240
worldwide. And my surgical uh oncologist

269
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,040
collaborator says that's the amount of

270
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,800
time it takes you to make a bagel um put

271
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,800
on the cream cheese and not even start

272
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,959
eating it yet. Woman was diagnosed with

273
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,519
stage three or stage four ovarian

274
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:20,880
cancer. The five-year survival rate is

275
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:23,040
um is uh 34% um at stage three, 14 uh

276
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,480
17% at stage four, and it's improved

277
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:31,920
very little o over the last uh last 20

278
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,360
years. Um and um so we um uh we we're

279
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,519
really concerned with this and we want

280
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,360
to think about how how you know what can

281
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,839
be done. So as you probably know there's

282
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,800
really no screen for ovarian cancers.

283
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,279
There's a large scale clinical trial um

284
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,040
in uh in Europe that looked at looking

285
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,440
at CA125 levels um and doing

286
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,760
transvaginal ultrasound and though they

287
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,440
could stage things earlier there was no

288
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,680
increase in survival of patients um and

289
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,640
um we do know that if you can find it at

290
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:07,120
at stage one um that if you have a um

291
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:10,000
um survival rate um that's much higher

292
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,320
about 15% of cases are are detected at

293
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,839
stage one. It's hard to find. It's hard

294
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,920
to find for a lot of reasons and we can

295
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,720
talk about that. So, we'd like to have a

296
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,079
screen um and an intervention for that.

297
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,440
Okay, here's the shocker and I don't

298
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,800
know how many people know this. I did

299
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,000
not know this till a couple of years

300
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,800
ago. So, ovarian cancer, we call ovarian

301
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,680
cancer, originates 85% of the time. Does

302
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,519
it originate from the ovaries? No, it

303
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,839
originates from the fallopian tubes.

304
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,920
It's really fallopian tube cancer. It

305
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,640
really starts in this tube that is

306
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,040
touching the um ovarian touching the

307
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,760
ovaries. It starts usually with a p-53

308
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,160
mutation and it starts to form a stick a

309
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,880
a precancer lesion. That precancer

310
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,600
lesion can be there for up to nine years

311
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,440
and from there it actually can start to

312
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,720
can start to spread and it's a different

313
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,640
kind of cancer. It doesn't spread

314
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,440
necessarily by the lymph nodes. Doesn't

315
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,120
necessarily spread in the blood system.

316
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,040
It actually sheds. It sheds into the

317
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,560
entrepreneurial space. That's why when a

318
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,560
woman is diagnosed at stage three or

319
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,519
stage four ovarian cancer, they don't

320
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,519
have one tumor. They have 10 tumors.

321
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,360
They have hundreds of tumors spread out

322
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,000
through the interparal space. And they

323
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,600
go through something that's called um um

324
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,279
they they go through reductive surgery

325
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,279
where the surgeon goes in, removes every

326
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,120
tumor that he or she can see by eye,

327
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,600
closes the patient up, and follows with

328
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,079
uh with chemotherapy. Patients become

329
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,160
resistant to chemotherapy and they um

330
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,560
most likely um relapse. And this

331
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:39,200
increases with BRCA 1 and two uh

332
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:42,000
mutations. Um so um we now know that

333
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,079
women that are at risk that have BRCA

334
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,639
one or two can have their fallopian

335
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,079
tubes taken out um when they're at at

336
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,560
the end of when they're no longer in

337
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,320
childbearing years. So if they're BA one

338
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,959
or two positive, they'll they'll have

339
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,880
their fallopian tubes taken out. We also

340
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,200
know from a um a large scale clinical

341
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,480
trial in Canada that women that have

342
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,519
their fallopian tubes which actually

343
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,120
have no function. They don't have a

344
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,839
hormonal function. Their function is to

345
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,000
carry the uh eggs um to the uterus um um

346
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,399
that if they have them taken out there's

347
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,920
almost zero can zero instances of

348
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,279
ovarian cancer. It's ovarian cancer

349
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,680
prevention. It's a way of preventing

350
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,079
preventing ovarian cancer but not all

351
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,160
women can do this. Um and also how does

352
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:27,600
it fit in with u a woman's desire for

353
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,920
reproductive uh cycle. So um we need to

354
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,000
um have a screening method. We need to

355
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,920
have an early intervention method for

356
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,519
for women. I want women when they go in

357
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,360
for their mammogram every year they go

358
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:42,160
in for ovarian cancer uh screening as

359
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,639
well. Um so we um when we were first

360
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,160
asked um to work on cancer I always tell

361
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,519
my students this. I didn't work on

362
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,920
cancer. I was happy I was working on

363
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,600
batteries. I had a a catalyst company. I

364
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,880
was doing things like that. And then the

365
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,680
president of MIT said, "I want you to

366
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,000
work on cancer." And I was like, "Oh,

367
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,959
well, uh, how about, you know, here's my

368
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,120
battery." Um, and um, and but the but

369
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,959
the idea was to put cancer biologists

370
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,399
and engineers in the same building, in

371
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,839
the same suite, and get them to interact

372
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,399
and work together. And I was very

373
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,160
intimidated by it, honestly, because um,

374
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,920
I didn't want to take up space for

375
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,639
someone doing more important work in

376
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,920
cancer because it is so important. Um,

377
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,959
but so I this is what I teach my

378
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,240
students when I'm going to run off and

379
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,079
teach. I actually talked to them about

380
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,920
this yesterday. When you're stuck and

381
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,680
you don't know what to do, start with

382
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,880
something you're really good at and then

383
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,560
go start with something you're very good

384
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,079
at and then start to branch out. So

385
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,720
that's what we did. I'm like I am good

386
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,880
at nanomaterials. Um I'm good at carbon

387
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,959
nano tubes. And so we started thinking

388
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,839
about carbon nanot tubes as not just

389
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,360
electrical materials or um or mechanical

390
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,959
materials but optical materials because

391
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,199
they have really interesting optical

392
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,040
properties in the near IR. So above a

393
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,120
thousand nanometers and many people in

394
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,639
this room basically looking at people's

395
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,639
um um tags I know that you already you

396
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,959
already know this uh kind of thing. So

397
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,360
we decided to look at near2 imaging for

398
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,920
non-invasive identification at at small

399
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,000
cells. So the idea is that near 2 above

400
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,760
1,000 nanometers and we're up to 1,000

401
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,240
to 1,800 nanometers you can see much

402
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,000
deeper. Now these devices didn't um

403
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,000
exist um that you couldn't buy them

404
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
commercially. That's a long story, but

405
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,839
my students um don't like to my students

406
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,360
like to build things. So, they set about

407
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,480
to build uh the instruments, and I'll

408
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,079
talk to you about them. The other thing

409
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,079
you need is a contrast agent. You need a

410
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,160
contrast agent that is fluorescent in

411
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,600
those wavelengths. Um and so, and that

412
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,199
you can modify. So, we looked, you know,

413
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,120
there's organic dyes. There's there are

414
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,800
quantum dots. They're rare earth

415
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,120
nanoparticles, which we spend a lot of

416
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,199
time in. Um these rare earth

417
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,040
nanoparticles here are both upconverting

418
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,880
and downconverting. This is an IR laser,

419
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,600
so you can't see it with your eye, but

420
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,600
you shine it on the nano particles. Um,

421
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,279
and they both upconvert and down convert

422
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,079
at the same time, which is which is

423
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,040
super uh uh important for us. But we can

424
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,759
think about these as as markers. So my

425
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,079
my group worked on making ultra ultra

426
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,759
bright um carbon nanot tubes making

427
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:02,079
plasmonic enhanced near dyes um and then

428
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,440
doing um up down conversion

429
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,279
nanoparticles for rare earth

430
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,279
nanoparticles looking for ovarian

431
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,160
cancer. Now the thing that we're really

432
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,800
interested in is hyperspectral imaging

433
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,320
for non-invasive non-instructive um and

434
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,040
what we really care about is how does

435
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,639
light interact with fallopian tubes? How

436
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,920
does light interact um with any organ

437
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,600
cell um that we're interested in? Um and

438
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,880
so people will know that hyperspectral

439
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,560
imaging has been used for

440
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,320
non-destructive food inspection, remote

441
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,800
sensing. Um but we wanted to use it for

442
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,199
lab label free manners to look for these

443
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,800
sticks or these small precancer lesions.

444
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,240
So we've built several instruments in

445
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,160
our lab. We built Dolphin which is

446
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,680
hyperspectral hyper diffuse imaging with

447
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,519
3D reconstruction with 8 cm uh detection

448
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,959
depth. Um we built um a um this is our

449
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,240
first generation instrument that was

450
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,560
just very um um primitive. Uh then we

451
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,279
built Swifty which we built with um

452
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,519
surgeons at MGH for real-time surgical

453
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,519
guided imaging to find tiny tumors

454
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,839
during surgery so they could surgically

455
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,799
plan which tumors to remove first. Oh,

456
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,079
I'll go back. You want to take a picture

457
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,480
of that? That's published. Um and um and

458
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,600
we found in these um with these surgical

459
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,760
guided imaging that if we um if we used

460
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,839
our near rear u ne near uh IR2 imaging

461
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,240
system um that we had much better

462
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,000
survival of patients and this is what my

463
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,000
surgical collaborator uh Michael Beer

464
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,640
told me to work on because I like I want

465
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,240
to prevent ovarian cancer and he said

466
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,400
Angie let's start with all the patients

467
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,480
that have ovarian cancer. let's see if

468
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,640
we can have them have a better outcome

469
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,320
through um finding tiny tumors and we

470
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,600
work with them on that that was a

471
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,559
project through the bridge project which

472
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,960
is a great program um and then I had a

473
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:52,720
student um a posttock

474
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:55,280
um who um who um started working started

475
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,480
working on looking at um vaccination and

476
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,160
how different vaccines and different

477
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,840
adgivants um affected uh lymph nodes um

478
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,080
and one of the things that that he

479
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,679
noticed is using shortwave length

480
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,760
infrared and uh polarization that we

481
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,320
could see the difference between lymph

482
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,240
nodes and fat or lymph nodes and muscle

483
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,679
they would just pop out. um and we

484
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,400
hadn't seen this in the literature

485
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,320
before and so he went and developed a a

486
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,880
technology I should say that we applied

487
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,080
to NIH twice for this and both times got

488
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:30,080
um rejected um and then we had a donor

489
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,160
um um part in terms and part of um um uh

490
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,840
of the Koch institute gave us money to

491
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,320
develop this this is what a lymph node

492
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,760
looks like under just light uh or under

493
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,520
microscope and this is what it looks

494
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,039
like under the technology because what

495
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,919
we've actually done is really tried to

496
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,320
take advantages of the differences is of

497
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,160
light absorption under polarization.

498
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,000
This is fat and this is lymph node. They

499
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,080
look very very same. So this we

500
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,720
developed this for colon cancer um

501
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,799
patients. So um patients that are under

502
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,000
having part of their colon taken out um

503
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,240
when they have part of their colon taken

504
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,240
out they take a lot of tissue out um and

505
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,080
they take a lot of lymph nodes out. They

506
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,280
have to whatever the there maybe 10

507
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,120
lymph nodes you need to get and send

508
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,280
those lymph nodes to pathology. And so

509
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,120
they get them first by feeling them uh

510
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,240
and then they put them in a a cont a

511
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,080
little area and then they go off to

512
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,360
pathology. And so we said, well, we can

513
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,640
actually just put them on our imaging

514
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,960
system and count the number of lymph

515
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,880
nodes, help them dissect that out and

516
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,160
then send them over to pathology. And so

517
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,240
that's the one that was rejected

518
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,400
multiple times by NIH, but then we

519
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,919
developed it on our own and this company

520
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,720
called Sision Vision. We got one of the

521
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,640
best inventions of 2023, invited to the

522
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,480
the White House and got a moonshot. And

523
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,640
now we're in 15 hospitals. So it went

524
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,480
from first prototype to hospitals in

525
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,640
three years and we've seen thousands of

526
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,120
patients and we've helped them we've

527
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,880
helped the pathologists um find lymph

528
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,360
nodes that they did not see during

529
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,160
regular palpation methods and have been

530
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,400
able to restage um CA patients with

531
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,400
cancer. Okay, so you didn't know I was

532
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,760
going to talk about asteroids but now

533
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,080
we're switching topics. But are we

534
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,600
really switching topics? Okay, so

535
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,280
there's this asteroid called asteroid

536
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,559
benign. You might have heard about it.

537
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:08,000
It it travels at 63,000 miles per hour

538
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:11,280
and it's about 1,673 feet across. Um,

539
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,840
and NASA and like a big big group of uh

540
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,000
of amazing researchers sent a probe to

541
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,559
this. It was a seven-year round trip. It

542
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,600
went 63 million miles at least just in

543
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:26,720
that distance. Landed moving object

544
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:29,760
landed. Took pictures, real time images

545
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,360
of a probe landing on an asteroid.

546
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,640
collected samples, rocks, sent it back.

547
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,640
Those rocks were were taken back and um

548
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,840
and brought back to the lab. I mean,

549
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,120
that is amazing. And it cost about 1.16

550
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,960
billion, which I actually think was was

551
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,039
not that not that bad. And yet, in 2025,

552
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,679
we still don't have a way of going this

553
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,000
deep inside of a woman's

554
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:57,120
abdomen to find a a one millimeter sized

555
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,640
tumor on her fallopian tubes. Okay? So

556
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,720
most of us are scientists and engineers

557
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,880
in this room. Do we think that that is

558
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,200
true? Do we think we can't do it or do

559
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,000
we think that we haven't applied enough

560
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,200
uh effort to figure out how to do it? Um

561
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,720
and so when I talk to people, they go,

562
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,240
"But yeah, Angie, cancer is really

563
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,640
really hard." I'm thinking asteroids,

564
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,799
yes, are are also really really hard.

565
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,480
And so what what we're doing is we're

566
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,640
putting together a group of engineers

567
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,640
and surgeons um working in many

568
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,200
different aspects of ovarian cancer. Can

569
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,640
we find it? Can we understand the

570
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,960
origins of precancer lesions, precancer

571
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,880
lesions? Can we intercept them? Can we

572
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,280
prevent them? You know, can we treat

573
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,679
them? Can we make them more receptive to

574
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,400
imunotherapies? And that's a big group.

575
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,080
Um, so my my uh surgical collaborator

576
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,720
during the pandemic, I was on a Zoom

577
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,640
with her. During the pandemic, I was on

578
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,159
a Zoom with her. I didn't know her. It

579
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,000
was a big Zoom. And she's talking about

580
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,840
when women have their fallopian tubes

581
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,600
taken out. Here's kind of a drawing of

582
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,280
it. It actually takes about five minutes

583
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,120
to have your fallopian tubes taken out.

584
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,600
Um, and I'm part of a public health

585
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,919
trans campaign that says when women are

586
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,840
under going to have like gallbladder,

587
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,840
appendicitis or something in their past

588
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,200
childbearing years, they um they should

589
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,120
go ahead and have their floating tubes

590
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,760
taken out. Takes additional five minutes

591
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,840
to do that and can be life-saving. But

592
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,000
women that are doing this for uh

593
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,240
prevention, if they're BRCA one or two

594
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,600
positive, um they they have their

595
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,600
fallopian tubes taken out and then

596
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,679
they're put in wax and they're sectioned

597
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,679
and about 1% of the fallopian tube is

598
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,880
looked at because the fallopian tube is

599
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,039
kind of big. I'll show you real pictures

600
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,200
of fallopian tubes in a minute. And she

601
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,280
goes, "We need a way to scan to look at

602
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
the whole fallopian tube." I'd never met

603
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,280
her before and I just instant messenger.

604
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,520
I go, "That's actually pretty easy. you

605
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,440
know, we can um we can we can solve

606
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,919
that, you know, pretty quickly if we're

607
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,360
using hyperspectral imaging in near

608
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,880
imaging. So, we she's actually one of my

609
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,159
best friends now. She's usually well,

610
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,640
she gets up at 4:30 in the morning.

611
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,480
She's a surgeon, but um she's um usually

612
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,440
one of the first people I talk to uh

613
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,679
every day. So, now for um patients that

614
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,720
are undergoing it's calledctomy, which

615
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,440
means they're having their fallopian

616
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,280
tubes taken out. They're taken out um at

617
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,360
John's Hopkins University where she's

618
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,440
head of gynecological oncology and we

619
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,960
have an IRB for this. Um they're sent in

620
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:14,080
organ transport media to MIT. We they're

621
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,120
barcoded, we c we categorize them um and

622
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:21,280
we start to image them. Um and we have a

623
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,600
database uh for this. Um and so we we

624
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,919
have we've seen over 50 patients now. We

625
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,760
categorize just optically all the

626
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,720
fallopian tubes that come in into the

627
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,720
lab. Um we do their biometrics their um

628
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,600
we we look at many different aspects of

629
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,360
them and you know no no two fallopian

630
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,880
tubes are the same and even no two

631
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,320
fallopian tubes in any woman are

632
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,039
actually the same. They have this

633
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,559
beautiful kind of fluffy end here that's

634
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,640
the one that not not physic it bumps up

635
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,360
against but it's not connected to this

636
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,200
region here not connected to to the

637
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,520
ovaries and this is where the p-53

638
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,600
mutations start and this is where the

639
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,400
precancer lesions start. So we do all

640
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,799
the biometrics of them. We look at uh

641
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,880
specimens from BRC patients versus

642
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,919
non-BRC patients and collect a lot of

643
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,600
data about this. We're trying to have

644
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,960
the biggest database of of fresh

645
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,080
fallopian tubes. If someone out here has

646
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,880
a bigger one, let me know. Um we can uh

647
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,400
collaborate. Um and so but people never

648
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,320
really so when when I go to these

649
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,159
meetings um and there's probably

650
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,080
radiologists in here, you can correct me

651
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,760
on this, but but they say to me, they

652
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,760
say fallopian tubes are really hard to

653
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,039
see inside of a woman. um they're really

654
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,480
hard to see because they look so much

655
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,640
like the the area around it. It's hard

656
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,039
to see by contrast enhanced CT. It's

657
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,960
hard to see by uh ultrasound, which my

658
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,679
my collaborator Sangita Batia is working

659
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,600
on new probes for that. Um and it's hard

660
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,120
to see um by um MRI because it looks

661
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,400
like the rest of the image. But if

662
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,760
you're looking at it under hyperspectral

663
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,240
image, if you scan the whole thing

664
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,919
between zero and 1800 nanometers

665
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,360
wavelength, you can find a wavelength

666
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,279
where floopin tubes pop out where you

667
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,559
can see them very very carefully. And so

668
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,080
we've done that. We've been

669
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,080
collaborating with um um pathologists at

670
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,919
Johns Hopkins where they are finding the

671
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,840
newest biomarkers for these precancer

672
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,760
lesions sending those we're attaching

673
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,159
either probes like these probes I showed

674
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,039
you that are fluorescent uh and looking

675
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,200
at that uh as well and so we make we

676
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,960
build these hyperspectral cubes uh at

677
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,960
many different wavelengths to try to

678
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,039
understand fallopian tubes both healthy

679
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,679
and non-healthy and then we start to

680
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,200
narrow down what wavelengths are the

681
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,440
best wavelengths of light for looking at

682
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,480
fallopian tubes. tubes, normal fallopian

683
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,880
tubes or um or um or ones that have um

684
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,880
um different kinds of

685
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,919
mutations. Um and here they are at

686
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,039
different wavelengths of light and

687
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,440
they're quite beautiful and they're

688
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:42,000
quite they're not invisible. Um you just

689
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,279
have to know how to look for them. Um I

690
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,120
think I already said, okay, here's the

691
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,679
cool thing though. After we look at

692
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,440
these fallopian tubes, we put them we we

693
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,480
fix them and we send them back to John's

694
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,080
Hopkins um where they we tattoo them and

695
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,080
they look for places that that we've

696
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,400
tattooed and they're able to find

697
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,480
regions that they did not see otherwise

698
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,919
and these are actually they could be

699
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,440
stick some of them could be stick

700
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,400
lesions but some of them are are

701
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,480
actually areas of inflammation and maybe

702
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,760
areas that are pre-stick lesions and so

703
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,159
once we have those we're working with

704
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,720
Krypa Veronasi another amazing inventor

705
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,919
he's a mechanical engineer He um you

706
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,640
have to look him up. His inventions are

707
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,000
amazing. Um we um so my friend Becky

708
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,600
said, "Oh, Angie can figure out how to

709
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,039
remove the cells." And Angie can't

710
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,559
figure out how to remove the cells, but

711
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,480
Krypa can figure out how to move the

712
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,720
cells. He's an expert in interfaces. So

713
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,559
he's developing technology to on these

714
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,480
these fallopian tubes from the patient

715
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,960
just to remove the cells from these

716
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,240
stick lesions, keep them viable, grow

717
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,799
them in so we can grow them into

718
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,480
organoids and study the development of

719
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:44,559
of those. um and we can culture them. We

720
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,960
can build patient specific organoids

721
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,480
based on mutations. And my friend Sanga

722
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,080
Batia is doing a lot of amazing work,

723
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,279
but she's growing fallopian tubes on a

724
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,760
chip um so that we can study understand

725
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,720
the the the mutations and the processes

726
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,279
along the way. H I was over ambitious in

727
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,080
this talk. Okay. So um we're starting to

728
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,840
work with uh Anantha um Chandra Quesan.

729
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,000
He's the dean of engineering. Besides

730
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,720
being a dean of engineering, he he has

731
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,159
done amazing development in um low power

732
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,279
chips. That's that's what he does. I

733
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,279
thought he was dean of engineering, but

734
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,200
no, he's actually one of the most famous

735
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,679
people in the world at low power chips.

736
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,159
Um and so um we started working together

737
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,919
on uh on building AI models around all

738
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,400
of this and machine learning because we

739
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,520
have this database that um is very very

740
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,400
unique. Um so we we um we look at our

741
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,840
fallopian tubes based on on probes. look

742
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,559
at our fellow computers based on how

743
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,120
they interact with light. Um we build u

744
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,880
models around it and now we're building

745
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,679
new

746
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:46,960
chips. Um where we can actually do the

747
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,000
um AI on chip um while we're scanning

748
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,400
the um the fallopian tubes. Um we've

749
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,279
also started saying okay can we use um

750
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,799
different methods of of imaging um and

751
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,600
segmentation to tell whether a patient

752
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,399
is BRCA um positive or negative um

753
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,000
without doing genetic analysis. And we

754
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,840
right now we've only been doing this for

755
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,640
a couple of weeks. We have about 90%

756
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,720
accuracy in telling if a patient is BRCA

757
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:15,919
uh positive or negative. Um we um we do

758
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:18,399
this based on on uh on slides of known

759
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,840
patients. Um, and I'm not going to say

760
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,720
too much about this, but I'm very

761
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,720
excited about it. So, if you're

762
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,240
interested in it, contact me. We've also

763
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,799
done the same thing to see if we can

764
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,640
tell if a patient has a p-53 mutation or

765
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,399
not. Um, and we can do that with

766
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,640
97.89%

767
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:37,360
accuracy. Um, the other aspect of this

768
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,520
is um, we work with patients. I visit

769
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,559
um, ovarian cancer patients in the

770
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,919
hospital. I visit them in clinic. Um, I

771
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:48,080
visit on panels. Um we're working with a

772
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,360
program that is the it's kind of turning

773
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,399
Henrietta Lax on the head which is not

774
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,520
doing um research on patients but doing

775
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,960
research with patients. Um and um so

776
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,880
we're part of a program where the

777
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,080
patients um interact with the surgeon

778
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,760
obviously they interact with um with um

779
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,440
the engineer they interact with the

780
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,799
scientists so that they actually can own

781
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,200
their own data. Um when our um fallopian

782
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:17,279
tubes make it um they have a bow wallet.

783
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,799
They look at okay they made it to MIT.

784
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,240
They get to look at images of their

785
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,240
their um their uh fallopian tubes. As we

786
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,720
culture their fallopian tubes and as we

787
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,559
make organoids and if we make a new cell

788
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,559
line we let them be involved in naming

789
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,760
the cell line um that came from their

790
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,679
own um uh body. And this is the um

791
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,279
thought of Marielle Gross. I mean not

792
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,279
thought it's a vision of Marielle Gross

793
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:43,039
who's at Johns Hopkins and PET. She's a

794
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:45,600
bioethicist and a um a gynecologist and

795
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:48,960
she's uh developing this um interaction

796
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,600
so patients can see and understand where

797
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,120
their biopecimens are and actually learn

798
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,559
about the technology that's being used

799
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,440
in screening it. So um we're interested

800
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,760
in tackling ovarian cancer um in all

801
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,960
these ways. I've run out of time. Uh I

802
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,039
want to thank you for your attention. I

803
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,480
know I went quickly. Um I'll try to come

804
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,679
back later, but I can probably take a

805
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,520
few questions if it's allowed.

806
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,120
Thank you very much Andrea. So broad the

807
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,159
scope of our research starting from

808
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:20,000
battery. So we take a few questions. Uh

809
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:22,960
any people questions? Yes. Hi thank you.

810
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,120
Um very nice talk. So I had a question

811
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,640
are there any biomarkers in the blood

812
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,200
for ovarian cancers that can be

813
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,440
detected? And the second question is are

814
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,000
those genetic mutation involved in other

815
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,640
type of cancer? Yes. So the answer are

816
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,840
um that there are um groups that are

817
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:43,279
looking um for biomarkers in uh in

818
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,520
ovarian cancer um but they're usually in

819
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,919
kind of later stage ovarian cancer. So

820
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,120
we're interested in u finding them much

821
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,960
earlier um and u my my collaborator

822
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,600
Senita Bates she's an expert in um

823
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,679
biomarkers and biomarker amplification

824
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,520
um and we're going back to the sticks

825
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,919
and pre-stick lesions looking for

826
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,799
biomarkers. She's developed uh an

827
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,640
optical uh amplification. Uh you can

828
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,640
look up uh her work or I can talk to you

829
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,480
more about it. And we want to find those

830
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:16,520
biomarkers in blood um in papsmears um

831
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,799
or in um um blood passes. Oh, you're in.

832
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,080
Yeah. Uh there was a second question. Do

833
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,840
you have a second question? Yeah. Yeah.

834
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,440
If the the mutation are involved in

835
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,799
other Yes. So p-53 so uh p-53 mutations.

836
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,559
Yes. Um BA mutations are also um in in

837
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,720
breast cancer as well. Um and uh p-53

838
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,640
mutations are in uh many kinds of

839
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,240
cancers. The technology we developed

840
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,240
because someone asked us can we do other

841
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,519
kinds of mutations we've done for Kas

842
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,480
Kas as well which um we're developing um

843
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:50,480
a optical um screen for very very early

844
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,399
um colon cancer as well.

845
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,640
Thank you.

846
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,200
Please use the mic so that the uh online

847
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,279
audience can hear. Hey, thanks Angela.

848
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,799
Uh two two questions. How do you keep

849
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,799
track of everything that's going on in

850
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,559
your mind? Do you write them down in a

851
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,039
notebook or how does that work? Here's

852
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,440
the key. You hire really smart people.

853
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,480
Um and so yeah, so I do have a

854
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,000
photographic memory. I had a

855
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,399
photographic memory when I was uh

856
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,519
younger. It's fading. Um but um one of

857
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,440
the things if you say, "Angie, what are

858
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,279
you good at?" I'm uh good at building

859
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,279
amazing teams. Um and um uh I don't

860
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,480
actually do any of the work myself. You

861
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,919
know, the students do all the work and

862
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,760
that's the best thing about being at MIT

863
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:33,279
is that our students are just and our

864
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,200
posttos are just the best. Um and um is

865
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,440
that bias? I guess it's bias. Sorry. Um

866
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,760
but um and so I meet with my teams and

867
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:44,080
my sub teams um a couple times a week.

868
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,240
Um and um I'm doing I'm living my dream.

869
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,440
Um and I only work on things I'm

870
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,840
interested in. That also helps. Um and

871
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,399
um I can't always keep the track keep

872
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,440
track of all the details but I do have

873
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:59,600
uh it's the team that that you build. Um

874
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,519
and um I'm a specialist at building good

875
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,120
teams. Amazing. Thank you. Just uh a

876
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,880
second question. Uh what percentage of

877
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,159
your work is commercialized by students

878
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,519
versus experienced entrepreneurs versus

879
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:12,320
industry partners? Yeah, I think that's

880
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:15,360
a great a great question. Um and so um

881
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,480
the last two companies uh Jensen um was

882
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,760
um um which um started out as a gene

883
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,279
therapy um uh company that was um spun

884
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:31,039
out by a graduate student uh of mine um

885
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:33,360
uh a team um and Yanga um and the um the

886
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,720
other company Sision Vision was uh spun

887
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,440
out by a postoc of mine um Jeremy Lee

888
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,880
and I showed you uh his picture. Uh my

889
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,360
first two companies were spun out by

890
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,760
myself with venture capital um and then

891
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,360
integrated in with with companies. Um

892
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,880
I'm spinning out a company right now on

893
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,799
high surface area carbons. I'm not sure

894
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,960
how that's going to work out. Um right

895
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,039
now I'm working with a a major mining

896
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,480
company where we've just done some

897
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,320
really cool work on rare earths. Um that

898
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,440
um I hope to do in collaboration with

899
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,480
them. So I'm I'm I'm a I want it to work

900
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,800
out well for my lab. Um I want to only

901
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,800
do things that are translatable.

902
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,919
um to help people or the planets. And so

903
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,960
what I don't want is someone to grab

904
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,200
something, put it on the shelf, and

905
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,280
never see the light of day. So I don't

906
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,280
have a model. Um I want to help my

907
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,159
students succeed. Um and I want to be um

908
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,440
involved uh because uh um so it's it

909
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,119
just it just it's different for

910
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,720
different ones. I've worked with uh a

911
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,520
lot of these ILP members that are up

912
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:36,399
here before um tech develop technologies

913
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,919
including I saw um one by um I saw ENI,

914
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,240
the Italian energy company. We developed

915
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:44,079
these um calcium carbonate based um

916
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,960
tiles um from yeast to grab uh excess

917
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,960
CO2 use paper waste paper pulp to make

918
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,639
tiles that was done in collaboration.

919
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,879
People usually come to me and say,

920
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,159
"Angie, I have this problem." Um, and

921
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:56,000
I'll look at the problem. I say, "First

922
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,359
of all, am I interested in it?" Um,

923
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,160
second, is it a problem that we can make

924
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,079
an impact in? And many of the problems

925
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,040
we can't. It's just not a it's not in

926
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,640
our our toolkit. Um, but then if it is,

927
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,119
then we jump on it and we try to find

928
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,119
partners for that.
