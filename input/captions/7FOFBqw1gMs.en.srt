1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,839
hello can people hear me in the back are

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,080
we

3
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:22,640
good okay so uh welcome to the last

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,160
lecture of 604 oh no 61200 yeah um I'm

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,720
I'm totally sayane I can remember which

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,640
class I'm teaching uh welcome you made

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:34,239
it through the semester well

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,239
done uh okay so for today's

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,719
material we are going to you know wrap

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,200
up our discussion of

11
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,719
probability and in particular we will be

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,440
discussing uh tail bounds so you know uh

13
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,320
what happens if you have a a random

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,239
variable like what is the probability

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,239
that this random variable is like very

16
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,359
large or very small like you know very

17
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:02,199
different from from its expectation

18
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,199
okay uh so let's start with a a bit a

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:11,920
review uh

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:14,240
variance okay so I think we uh saw from

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,880
the last not last lecture two lectures

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,560
ago possibly uh so the variance of a

23
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,560
random variable

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,880
R uh is defined to be the

25
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:31,920
expectation of uh R minus the

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
expectation of r

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,159
uh

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,280
squared

29
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,759
okay uh and the standard deviation is

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,799
just the square root of that you know if

31
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,040
you've uh taken you know stats or

32
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,320
anything like that that's probably uh

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,759
you know something that you've seen more

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,840
more often than

35
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,759
variance uh another you know not a

36
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,159
definition but another useful formula an

37
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,960
equivalent formulation of this is that

38
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,759
the variance of r

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,960
is also equal to the

40
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:10,599
expectation of r

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:14,560
s minus the square of the expectation of

42
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:16,720
R okay uh so not the definition but it's

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,400
equivalent and uh I think in recitation

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,440
perhaps you uh you proved this um this

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,000
this formula is is a particularly useful

46
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,040
one for what we're going to be doing

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,239
today

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,120
okay uh we also saw that uh you know

49
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,519
Varian is linear subject to uh you know

50
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,040
certain constraints does anybody

51
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,599
remember what uh what you need for for

52
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,599
variance to be

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,800
linear

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,400
yeah

55
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,879
Independence okay so if you

56
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,159
have R1

57
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,840
R2 RN are

58
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,159
independent

59
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,519
then uh the variance of the sum is the

60
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,519
sum of the

61
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,920
variances

62
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,920
oops uh is that the right

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:31,760
constraint is it

64
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,760
correct who who believes this statement

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,159
who

66
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,239
disbelieves who's who's still

67
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,000
asleep oh okay maybe we'll we'll give it

68
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,439
a few minutes for people to wake

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,200
up uh okay um well this is a correct

70
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:54,200
statement uh however there's something

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,159
uh slightly stronger that we can say we

72
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,120
can weaken this this condition right we

73
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,519
don't need Mutual Independence what do

74
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,519
we actually need

75
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,159
pair ways Independence

76
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,079
yeah okay so if we have a bunch of

77
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,480
Parise independent random variables we

78
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,560
want to find the variance of their sum

79
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,959
we can instead just sum the variances

80
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,160
okay so another very useful fact uh

81
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,639
hopefully you proved it already in

82
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,720
recitations so we don't need to go over

83
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,000
the

84
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,680
proof uh but these uh well

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,039
these two formulas are going to be quite

86
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,039
useful

87
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,120
today

88
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,560
okay now time for the first of our

89
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,199
tailbones so before I uh give you the

90
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,759
bound uh let's let's think about an

91
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:03,720
example so looking at this room uh

92
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,720
suppose I pick a random student and uh

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,639
you know let the random variable R be

94
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,120
the the row that the the randomly picked

95
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:15,000
student is is sitting in okay so

96
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,160
guesstimate that this is about uh you

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
know the expectation of R is about eight

98
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,000
so so pick random

99
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,039
student R is the row

100
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,319
okay so for uh those of you who aren't

101
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,800
in the room those of you who are

102
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,440
watching the video uh what does that

103
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,400
tell them about uh the probability that

104
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,400
R is at least

105
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,800
16 so what's the probability that a

106
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,199
randomly selected student is sit sitting

107
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,800
in the last five rows I think there 21

108
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,800
rows here

109
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,680
yeah does anybody have any

110
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,599
idea so maybe I should label this as an

111
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,599
example

112
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,840
yeah one minus the CDF okay so the

113
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,039
people watching the uh watching the

114
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,199
video can't I assume they can't see the

115
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:33,280
room so they don't know what the CD

116
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,639
is right the only information they

117
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,639
know is that the expectation is

118
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,639
eight

119
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,440
okay

120
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,720
yeah oh can we find the variance from

121
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:53,680
that and then see how far away we are uh

122
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,039
no that uh requires more information

123
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,800
right like we we need to know a little

124
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,960
bit more about uh about what's going on

125
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,440
right like we we need to you know

126
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,560
somehow figure out you know the

127
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,000
expectation of R minus 8 squar so like

128
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,879
we need to know something more about R

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,879
than than just its

130
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,879
expectation

131
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,560
yeah yes there're 21 so 0 through

132
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,560
20

133
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:28,120
yeah can we assume that it's uniformally

134
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,039
distributed uh no and in fact it it is

135
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,720
not uh there seem to be

136
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:35,319
you know more students towards the front

137
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,319
than than towards the back

138
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,120
yeah yeah

139
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,560
yeah so your intuition is great though

140
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,639
right so um well we're using the

141
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,960
observation that uh that you know 16 is

142
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,720
is twice 8 right we're we're also using

143
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,039
the observation that uh you know the

144
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,599
rows are numbered 0 through 20 like

145
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,360
they're they're non

146
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:25,599
negative okay so what

147
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,319
happens if you know more than half of

148
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,440
the

149
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,440
students are sitting in the back five

150
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
rows

151
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,919
what does that tell us about the

152
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,440
expectation well if if more than half of

153
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,720
the students you know give us R is is at

154
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,160
least

155
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,760
16 right that tells us that the

156
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,519
expectation should be at least

157
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,720
eight right or sorry more than

158
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,200
eight if if more than half of the

159
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,440
students are in the back okay so the

160
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,000
converse of

161
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,720
that is that there are at most half of

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,839
the students in the back five

163
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,920
rows okay so let's try and formalize

164
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,880
this

165
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,440
intuition so this is what's known as

166
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,440
Markov in

167
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:31,320
equality uh so let R be a non- negative

168
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,120
random

169
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,920
variable uh then the

170
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,240
probability that R is greater than or

171
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,519
equal to

172
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,480
X is less than or equal to the

173
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,959
expectation of

174
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,839
r divided by

175
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,720
X

176
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,079
okay so for the example that we just saw

177
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,040
right the probability that uh R is at

178
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:03,760
least

179
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:08,240
16 it's at most the expectation which is

180
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:11,399
8 ID 16 so that gives us 1

181
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,920
12 okay does the uh does the statement

182
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,920
make sense to

183
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,680
people so basically it's saying that you

184
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,920
know you can't have too many super large

185
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,680
values because that would push the

186
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,279
expectation up too

187
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,639
high

188
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,639
okay so how could we prove

189
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,560
this any ideas how do we formalize the

190
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,560
intuition that we were just talking

191
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,600
about let's try let's try using the law

192
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,680
of total expectation

193
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,560
so how can we write the expectation of

194
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,560
R what might we condition

195
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,519
on we don't have too many events that we

196
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,519
can work with

197
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,560
right which of them might be useful

198
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,279
nobody so let's try let's try

199
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,279
conditioning on X greater than oh wait

200
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,279
was it

201
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,320
x

202
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,200
uh yeah R greater than or equal

203
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,240
x

204
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,519
okay so what does the law of total

205
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,720
expectation tell

206
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:58,000
us well this is going to be the

207
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,240
expectation of our conditioned on R

208
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,240
being greater than x

209
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,760
multiplied by the probability that R is

210
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,760
greater than

211
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,560
x okay

212
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,519
plus the

213
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,720
expectation are conditioned on R less

214
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,720
than

215
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,800
x times that

216
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:32,519
probability okay do people remember that

217
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:33,920
that coming back hopefully yes no maybe

218
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,839
few

219
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,680
nods

220
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,880
okay so what do we know about each of

221
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,880
these values

222
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,920
let's start with this one can anybody

223
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,920
bound

224
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,480
this

225
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,120
yeah yeah it's at least X if you

226
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,120
conditioned on R being at least X right

227
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,000
the expectation of R is is also going to

228
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,880
be at least X right every outcome is at

229
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,399
least

230
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:35,040
X okay

231
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:37,519
so this is going to be at least x

232
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,519
times well this is the probability that

233
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,680
that we're looking for so let's just

234
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,680
write it out as it

235
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,600
is

236
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,399
okay now what about the bottom

237
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,920
line what do we know about this

238
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,920
expectation

239
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,959
yeah is it one minus the expectation uh

240
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,880
of the other one uh no so the the

241
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,360
probability is one minus the uh the

242
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,959
other probability uh the expectation

243
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,399
does not work like that though

244
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:24,160
yeah it is at most X that is true um

245
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:27,160
we're actually looking for a lower bound

246
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,160
though

247
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,839
yeah so at least Z

248
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,880
yeah

249
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,720
okay right we know that that R is always

250
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,120
non

251
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,160
negative so you know conditioning on

252
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,800
anything R is still always going to be

253
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,399
non- negative so it's expectation has to

254
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,399
be non-

255
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,399
negative

256
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,160
okay so we we can drop this this is just

257
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,600
going to be

258
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,600
zero now we've got the expectation of

259
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,480
R is at

260
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,839
least x times the probability that R is

261
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,839
at least

262
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,839
X

263
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,759
okay now we can just move this x to the

264
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,759
other side

265
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,639
assuming X is not negative if x is

266
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,639
negative then it's a it's a very silly

267
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,279
question so you know or sorry assuming X

268
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,519
is

269
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:51,519
positive okay are people happy with this

270
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,600
proof do anybody have any questions

271
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:15,519
so another form of marov which you uh

272
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,519
May often encounter is the

273
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:31,800
following so the probability that R is

274
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,800
at least uh C c times its

275
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,880
expectation is at most one over

276
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,880
C

277
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,160
okay for any positive

278
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,040
C so essentially equivalent statement

279
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,079
just you know you might sometimes see it

280
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,000
in this form

281
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,240
instead

282
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,839
okay so let's take a look at a couple

283
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,839
more examples

284
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,760
so

285
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,520
suppose or is uh the test score of a

286
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,120
randomly chosen student instead of the

287
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,120
road that they're sitting in

288
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:44,080
okay and uh suppose that these are all

289
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:48,640
in the range uh

290
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,640
say 30 to

291
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,440
100% okay

292
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,799
uh can we use

293
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,559
marov to bound the

294
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:13,760
probability that R is at least say

295
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,960
90% how might we do

296
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,720
that h

297
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,640
sorry I completely forgot to give you

298
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,640
the expectation the answer is

299
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,640
no

300
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,000
uh okay now can you do

301
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,000
it hopefully it's a little bit easier

302
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
now

303
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,760
mhm yeah so find the value of C such

304
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,000
that c c * 75 is

305
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:20,799
90 uh

306
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:25,120
so I guess 75 over or 90 divided

307
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,120
75 that's what's

308
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:34,280
1.2 is that right

309
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:39,440
uh 75 is 5 by 15 right 90 is 6 by 15

310
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:41,880
okay nice arithmetic score okay so then

311
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,080
uh using

312
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,840
uh this formulation here we

313
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,679
have the

314
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:55,960
probability that R is at least uh you

315
00:19:51,679 --> 00:20:00,640
know 1.2 times

316
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,640
uh expectation of r

317
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:06,679
is at most 1 divid

318
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,159
1.2 okay so this is going to be you know

319
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:09,159
something like

320
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,880
83%

321
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:22,320
okay people reasonably happy with

322
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,320
that

323
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,200
yeah oh the question is um can we

324
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,640
explain the difference between these two

325
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,640
formulations

326
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,440
sorry uh so yeah essentially there is no

327
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,520
difference like there're just uh you

328
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,480
know different ways of of thinking about

329
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,880
uh thinking about the bound you can

330
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,360
either think about bounding it in terms

331
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,200
of some you know absolute threshold or

332
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,720
you can think about it as like in terms

333
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,840
of some you know relative threshold like

334
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,520
you know multiply the uh the expectation

335
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,200
by some by some scaling Factor okay so

336
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,039
you know depending on on which of them

337
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,799
feels more natural to you uh we could

338
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,679
also used the first formulation to say

339
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,880
you know

340
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,440
probability that R is greater than

341
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,760
90 greater than or equal to is going to

342
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:15,840
be at most uh 75 over

343
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:18,440
90 which you know same thing

344
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,720
83% okay so either of them Works they

345
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,240
both give the same answer they're

346
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,600
equivalent formulations it's just you

347
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,840
know whichever one you find easier to

348
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,840
think about question

349
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,960
yes exactly okay so the question was uh

350
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,039
we don't just have a non- negative

351
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,480
random variable R right we we've

352
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:46,279
actually got an even stronger bound R is

353
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,200
at least 30 not just at least zero okay

354
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,559
so can we leverage that to get an even

355
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,720
stronger

356
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,720
bound okay so how could we do

357
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,120
that well let's try def finding

358
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,120
different random

359
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:14,520
variable

360
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:17,520
so let R Prime be Rus

361
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,520
30

362
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,000
okay so this is another random variable

363
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,360
right we're just going to take our

364
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,480
original R we're going to subtract 30 um

365
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,400
we're not going to do this to people's

366
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,000
exam scores in reality don't don't worry

367
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,679
uh but that this makes the the minimum

368
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,520
exam score zero

369
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:40,000
right so the hope is that you know now

370
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,679
we're kind of satisfying the condition

371
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,760
to to markov's uh inequality like more

372
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,240
tightly so hopefully marov will give us

373
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,960
a tighter bound okay so what bound does

374
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:57,400
it give us now what is the

375
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,400
probability that R is at least 90

376
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,440
well what is that in terms of R Prime

377
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,440
what is that

378
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:14,840
event

379
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,039
yeah yeah so this is the same event and

380
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:21,120
so the same

381
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:21,120
probability that R Prime is at least

382
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,840
60 now what happens when we apply Markov

383
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,840
to

384
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:50,000
this well this is going to be at

385
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
most

386
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:02,159
right the expectation of RP Prime

387
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:06,360
ID

388
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,360
60 what is the expectation of R

389
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:23,840
Prime yeah 45

390
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:29,520
yeah so this is going to be the

391
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:34,480
expectation of R uh minus

392
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:36,200
30 / 60 which is the expectation so

393
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,720
linearity of expectation we can pull

394
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,159
this or like we can you know split this

395
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,559
into two expectations so this is the

396
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,559
expectation of

397
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,760
R minus the expectation of 30 there's

398
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,679
you know not really any Randomness

399
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:55,080
involved there it's just

400
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:58,480
30 over 60 right so this is

401
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:02,039
45 over 60

402
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,039
okay does that make sense to

403
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,120
everybody so now instead of this bound

404
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,360
of uh you know it's it's at most 83% now

405
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,360
we've got the better bound it's at most

406
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,559
75%

407
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:25,559
okay so by shifting our random variable

408
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:25,559
we've managed to get a tighter bound

409
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,320
okay what

410
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:50,159
about the probability that R is at most

411
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:50,159
65

412
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,039
yeah mhm

413
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,480
so that that's kind of what we're doing

414
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,279
right the the the question was uh in the

415
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,640
proof of Markov right we're assuming

416
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:20,640
that the lower bound is zero uh here

417
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,720
we've got a lower bound of 30 instead so

418
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,760
do we need to do something more

419
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,320
complicated the answer is no we don't

420
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,960
have to but if we do it gives us a

421
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,799
stronger result so that's what we've

422
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,600
done here but we don't have to do it

423
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,559
right because zero is still a valid

424
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,080
lower bound right we could still say we

425
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,960
could say that the co- domain of R is 0

426
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,559
to 100 instead of 30 to 100 even even if

427
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,919
the range stays

428
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,679
unchanged okay so it's still a non-

429
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:48,880
negative random variable so we're still

430
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,240
allowed to apply marov to it it's just

431
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,720
that you know doing it on r instead of R

432
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,080
Prime gives us a weaker

433
00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:00,240
result okay does that make sense to

434
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,240
everybody another question

435
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,480
uh so the question is what do I mean by

436
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:15,120
by a tighter bound when when we shift R

437
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:20,279
uh so tighter in the sense that it is

438
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:23,880
stronger right so uh r at least 30

439
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:27,039
implies that R is at least zero so r r

440
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,240
at least 30 is a stronger condition than

441
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:32,279
than r at least zero

442
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,279
okay so that that's what I mean by

443
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,360
tighter uh so the the difference right

444
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,200
is how we're applying marov right uh we

445
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,480
are in the first case we're applying

446
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,159
marov to R directly in the second case

447
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,399
we are creating a new random

448
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:00,080
variable uh and we're applying marov to

449
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:02,320
that and you know because uh you know

450
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:06,120
we've got a a stronger condition like

451
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:09,000
the the marov markov's um what do you

452
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:13,799
call it precondition is is tight

453
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,799
now uh we can get a a stronger

454
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,640
result okay

455
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:30,120
yeah uh could it go higher than 83%

456
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,480
uh okay so we will get to that in a

457
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,880
moment the the question is you know if

458
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,360
we're in a different

459
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,000
situation uh could shifting it give us

460
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:43,760
something that's higher than

461
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,600
83% and the answer is yes

462
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:50,080
is right in the case where we've applied

463
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Markov incorrectly the first time then

464
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,640
yes but uh you know if we've applied

465
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,960
Markov correctly then uh you know the

466
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,799
first is a valid bound right

467
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,960
right so you know we we could in

468
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:07,120
principle improve it but uh you know

469
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,799
we're not going to do any worse by you

470
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,039
know imposing tighter

471
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,720
conditions does that like at least kind

472
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,720
of intuitively make sense I'll give you

473
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,720
a more complete answer in a

474
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,000
moment any more questions about this

475
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,000
before we move on to the next

476
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
example

477
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,760
yeah yes

478
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,120
it is a good thing uh so the the

479
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,080
question is is it a good thing that the

480
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,960
75% is smaller than the

481
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,519
83% uh yes we are looking for an upper

482
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,480
bound on the probability right so a

483
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,919
smaller upper bound is a stronger

484
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,559
condition so that's that's better it's

485
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,799
um it's a it's a stronger bound you want

486
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,399
a smaller upper or AER so that they're

487
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:54,720
the same smaller upper bounds are

488
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:54,720
stronger upper bounds

489
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,919
yeah so like less than or equal to 83%

490
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,679
implies less than or equal to uh sorry

491
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:07,840
less than or equal to 75% implies less

492
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,840
than or equal to to 83% so 75 is is

493
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:11,679
stronger

494
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,480
okay okay have people had enough time to

495
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,720
think about the probability that R is at

496
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,720
most

497
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,360
65 how might we use marov to figure this

498
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,360
one out

499
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,320
yeah

500
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:48,120
okay so R greater than or equal to 66 so

501
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,840
if we assume integer

502
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,600
scores

503
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,880
okay

504
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,880
um and what does marov tell us about

505
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,880
this

506
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,519
well the probability that R

507
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:26,840
is at least

508
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:29,399
66 right is going to be at most 75 over

509
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,399
66

510
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:34,399
which is bigger than

511
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:36,159
one so applying marov does not tell us

512
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,760
anything useful it tells us that this is

513
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,000
a probability that's that's bounded by

514
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,000
one which we already

515
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:50,000
knew so it is a good idea it's not quite

516
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:50,000
what we want here

517
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,639
so what if instead of uh you know

518
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:09,720
fiddling with the event we fiddle with r

519
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:09,720
again kind of similar to what we did

520
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,760
before

521
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,960
yeah yeah exactly so we're going to flip

522
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:32,399
R right so we're going to define a new

523
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:37,000
random variable let's say s equals

524
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,000
100 minus r

525
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:41,799
okay so now the probability that R is at

526
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,159
most

527
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:50,360
65 is the probability that s is at least

528
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,360
what 100 minus 65

529
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:59,080
35

530
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,080
okay can we apply Markov to that

531
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:02,679
I'm seeing some nods does anybody want

532
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,919
to do that and spare me the trouble of

533
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,919
doing

534
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:14,360
arithmetic nobody sadness okay

535
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,919
uh well what does Markov say well it's

536
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,080
at most the expectation of

537
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:22,880
X oh sorry

538
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,880
s divided by

539
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,840
35 okay what is the expectation of s

540
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,200
well using linearity in the same way

541
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,559
that we did a moment

542
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:39,399
ago this is going to be equal to uh what

543
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:46,320
100 minus the expectation of R which is

544
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:46,320
75 over 35 so that's 25 over 35 this is

545
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,840
57s

546
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,559
okay so does does that make sense to

547
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,039
everybody there is at most a 57th chance

548
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:05,039
that you uh did worse than

549
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:05,039
65

550
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,480
okay now perhaps not terribly realistic

551
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,119
in terms of exam scores but uh you know

552
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,879
what if say some of the students did so

553
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,240
badly that they got scores that are less

554
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:42,960
than zero like maybe you've got uh you

555
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,320
know R is in the range you know minus 30

556
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,320
to

557
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,200
100

558
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,960
okay same deal expectation of r

559
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,839
is

560
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:12,920
75 uh question or

561
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:16,640
um sorry um okay so what can we say

562
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:20,119
about the probability that R uh is at

563
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,119
least uh say

564
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,640
90 mhm

565
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,760
yeah exactly so the observation was

566
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:41,640
right if we try to apply marov to this

567
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,680
maybe I should call it a different call

568
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,680
it something different let's call it

569
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,280
t so if we try to apply Markov to

570
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,880
T right it's going to be the same thing

571
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:59,240
as as when we applied Markov to R before

572
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,920
it'll give us a bound of of 83% the

573
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,680
problem is that that's wrong that does

574
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,520
it t does not satisfy the precondition

575
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,640
for

576
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,440
Markov okay so what we want to do

577
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:11,839
instead is

578
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,040
toine T Prime = t +

579
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:16,599
30

580
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,960
okay and now if we apply Markov to T

581
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:24,520
Prime what do we get so the probability

582
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:28,119
that uh T is greater than

583
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:31,040
90 is the probability

584
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:33,800
that t Prime is at least

585
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,200
120

586
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,640
okay and by Mark of this is going to be

587
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,920
uh

588
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,520
expectation of T

589
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:47,040
Prime over

590
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:52,280
120 okay and you know same deal as

591
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:54,599
before linearity here gives us uh 75 +

592
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:59,520
30 over

593
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:59,520
120 105 over 120 that's

594
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:06,000
78 is that

595
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
right

596
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,040
yeah

597
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,400
okay so in this case we do get a you

598
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,800
know in some sense a weaker bound than

599
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,040
we would have gotten by applying Markov

600
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,400
to to t you know directly but you know

601
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,920
applying Markov to T directly doesn't

602
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,680
actually work this you know looks weaker

603
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,000
but it's a correct bound okay so

604
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,520
hopefully that answers your question

605
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,520
more fully

606
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,079
okay does anybody have any

607
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,680
questions so even though we couldn't

608
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:39,680
apply Markov directly to T we can create

609
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,000
a new random variable T Prime to which

610
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,599
marov does

611
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,599
apply MH

612
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,280
yeah

613
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,440
uh so using the lower bound of 30 making

614
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,960
the

615
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:08,319
the the statement stronger for for t for

616
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:12,880
S oh for S uh which one was s uh s here

617
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:16,480
um so that does not really help us in

618
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:20,079
this case um because that kind of

619
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,560
corresponds to uh an upper

620
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,880
bound right rather than rather than the

621
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,800
lower bound uh and you know upper bounds

622
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,359
don't really appear in in the proof of

623
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,560
Markov like we're not really using them

624
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,960
in any way so you know imposing a

625
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,400
stronger upper bound doesn't really

626
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:42,119
doesn't really help okay does does that

627
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,119
kind of answer your question okay

628
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,119
cool

629
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:54,560
yeah uh okay is it always the case that

630
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,760
the best lower bound appears or sorry

631
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,920
the best upper bound I guess appears uh

632
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,200
when uh when the the range actually

633
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:08,000
includes

634
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:08,000
zero um essentially yes

635
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,640
okay as far as correct bounds go

636
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,680
anyway

637
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,319
okay

638
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:25,640
[Music]

639
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:28,720
so I guess there's a question of like

640
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:32,480
morally why do we need this this non-

641
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:35,640
negativity um

642
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,480
and perhaps a very simple illustrative

643
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:41,839
example is suppose we have the random

644
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:44,839
variable R which is uh plus or minus one

645
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:47,640
depending on you know a Fair coin flip

646
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:47,640
okay so it's it's

647
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:56,920
uniform on positive one and negative

648
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,880
1 okay so if we try to apply Markov to

649
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,720
to that

650
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,599
corly

651
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:07,079
right what does that tell us about the

652
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:07,079
probability that R is greater

653
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:33,079
than2 well if we try to apply marov

654
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,079
directly right the expectation of R is

655
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:40,520
zero so you know no matter what we put

656
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:44,280
here marov would try to tell us that you

657
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:48,160
know the probability is at most

658
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,720
zero okay that is clearly rubbish right

659
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,720
because you know R can be greater than

660
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:55,319
1/2 R takes value one with probability

661
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:59,720
1/2

662
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:02,720
okay so basically our proof uh where was

663
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,720
it

664
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,400
here so if we if we get rid of the non-

665
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:10,280
negativity constraint then this no

666
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,839
longer

667
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:16,480
works right we can't kind of discard

668
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:18,599
This this term because that zero you

669
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,599
know if we don't know that the the

670
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,560
random variable is non negative we could

671
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:25,480
in principle have a have a negative

672
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:29,000
value there which you know we we we

673
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,000
can't get rid of

674
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:41,760
okay so another

675
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,760
question is Markov tight

676
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,119
so in other

677
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,880
words can we make a stronger statement

678
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,760
than what marov tells us you know out of

679
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,280
the

680
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,720
tin just with you know the information

681
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,480
that we we have the mean and we have a

682
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,480
non- negative random

683
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,079
variable is there anything stronger that

684
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,079
we can

685
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,640
say who thinks

686
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:28,119
yes couple of tentative hands who thinks

687
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:29,920
no uh couple of less tentative tons who

688
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:33,800
has no

689
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:36,839
idea okay well let's let's think about

690
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,720
some some uh simple examples then okay

691
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:43,200
so let's go back to the uh cell phone

692
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,319
check problem from uh was it last week

693
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,559
don't remember which of the lectures

694
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:52,480
last week Tuesday Thursday both both

695
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:54,400
okay okay so if we consider the Lazy

696
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,599
Susan version

697
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,160
right and we let R be the number

698
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:02,160
of

699
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,559
people

700
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,559
who get their

701
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,559
phone okay so this is the Lazy

702
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:22,720
Susan

703
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:25,119
uh how could we use Markov to bound the

704
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,440
probability that everybody gets their

705
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,440
phone back

706
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,040
so if everybody gets their phone back

707
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,040
right that's R equals

708
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,480
n what does marov tell us about this

709
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,480
probability

710
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,559
yeah yeah it's the most one over

711
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:18,319
n why is that well the expectation of R

712
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,640
is one as we saw last week right the

713
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:23,640
bound we're looking at is

714
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,839
n okay so there's at most a one and

715
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,040
probability that everybody gets their

716
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:28,240
phone

717
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,079
back what is the actual probability that

718
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,079
everybody gets their phone

719
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:40,800
back

720
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:44,079
yeah yeah the actual probability is 1/ n

721
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,760
so this is tight okay we can't say

722
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,200
anything stronger than marov without

723
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,200
additional

724
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:53,359
information okay does that make

725
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,359
sense so if we know something else about

726
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,200
our distribution then we might be able

727
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:03,000
to say something more but if all we know

728
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:05,000
is the expectation and the the non-

729
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,400
negativity then Markov is the best that

730
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,400
we can

731
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,400
do

732
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:15,680
okay on the other hand you know suppose

733
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,960
suppose we're permuting all of the

734
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,359
phones instead of you know putting them

735
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,440
on the Lazy

736
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:23,440
Susan Okay so

737
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,760
so in this case what does marov tell us

738
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:41,319
about the uh probability that everybody

739
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,319
gets their phone

740
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:50,119
back it's still one over n right we've

741
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,880
still got uh a non- negative random

742
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:54,160
variable with the same mean we're still

743
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:58,079
looking at the same threshold right so

744
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,079
marov gives us the same bound

745
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:12,240
okay what is the actual probability that

746
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,240
everybody gets their phone back

747
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:31,400
well that's that's exactly when you have

748
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:33,400
the identity permutation right you've

749
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,520
got n factorial possible permutations

750
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,680
one of them gives everybody's phone

751
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,520
back so what we're looking for is

752
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,880
actually one/ n

753
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:47,119
factorial okay so so marov is is very

754
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,119
much not tight in this

755
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,280
example okay

756
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:09,319
okay so the next question is what can we

757
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:09,319
say if we do have more information about

758
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,160
uh about a random

759
00:47:17,319 --> 00:47:22,599
variable so suppose we know the

760
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,559
variance okay so the variance of those

761
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:27,040
two distributions is very different

762
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:29,000
right uh in the case where we put the

763
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,359
the phones on the Lazy Susan we've got a

764
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,880
very high variance in the case where we

765
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:36,119
have a random permutation it's much

766
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,440
lower okay so maybe the variance can

767
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:41,880
tell us you know

768
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,880
more about these

769
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:53,800
probabilities okay so this is a

770
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,800
different tail bound uh due to Chubby

771
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:56,800
Chev

772
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:05,280
so

773
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,240
probability that R minus the expectation

774
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,200
of

775
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,839
R uh you know an absolute value is at

776
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,559
least

777
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:16,760
X is less than or equal to the variance

778
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,760
of

779
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:21,000
x /

780
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,040
x^2 okay

781
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:34,200
so note that we no longer require non-

782
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,880
negativity here we just require

783
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:39,280
information about the

784
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,800
variance okay and well the mean we have

785
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,480
to uh we have to compute it relative to

786
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,400
the

787
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,240
mean

788
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,880
okay so but but R can be any random

789
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,400
variable we're we're no longer

790
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,720
constrained to to looking at non-

791
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:57,319
negative ones it can be anything we just

792
00:48:53,720 --> 00:49:01,520
have to compute the variance

793
00:48:57,319 --> 00:49:01,520
okay how might we prove chubby shvs

794
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:14,280
inequality any

795
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,160
ideas is that a hand or a stretch

796
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:29,000
yeah yeah so we're we're going to prove

797
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:34,160
Chev using

798
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,160
marov okay so in order to use

799
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,280
marov what do we need well we need an

800
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,839
all negative random variable

801
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,960
okay so kind of similar to what we were

802
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:51,040
doing earlier with shifting our random

803
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,160
variable we're going to define a new

804
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:56,960
random variable that we can then apply

805
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:58,520
Markov to and that should give us this

806
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,520
result

807
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,520
here

808
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:10,799
okay does that make sense to

809
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:10,799
everybody

810
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:20,040
yeah oh variance of R sorry thank

811
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:23,040
you yes variance of X does not make any

812
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,040
sense

813
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:35,280
okay so what might be a useful random

814
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,280
variable that we can apply Markov

815
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,440
to well maybe here's a way we can kind

816
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,559
of

817
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,680
cheat

818
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:58,240
uh in markov's inequality what's the

819
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,240
bound that we get

820
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,160
the bound should be the expectation of

821
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:06,359
our random variable

822
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:10,480
right so can we Define a random variable

823
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:10,480
whose expectation is the variance of of

824
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,200
R

825
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:22,839
yeah yeah exactly so R Prime equals R

826
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,839
minus

827
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,400
expectation

828
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:30,960
squared okay

829
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,000
so this is non- negative right it's it's

830
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,720
a square of some

831
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,559
value uh its expectation you know by

832
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,200
definition is the variance of

833
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:47,960
R

834
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:50,720
okay and also if we kind of squint right

835
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,720
we can fiddle around with this to you

836
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,079
know actually threshold R Prime instead

837
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:58,119
of this absolute value thing that we've

838
00:51:55,079 --> 00:52:00,680
got here how do we do

839
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:02,240
that well we just Square the stuff in

840
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,799
the absolute value right as the same

841
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,920
square as if we didn't have the absolute

842
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:11,200
value okay so the

843
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:11,200
probability that R minus its

844
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,960
expectation greater than or equal to

845
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:19,400
x equals the

846
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:22,520
probability that R

847
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,640
Prime is greater than or equal to

848
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,799
x^2 right because those are exactly the

849
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,280
same event

850
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:30,559
okay they're the same event so they have

851
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,280
the same

852
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,799
probability and now this looks like

853
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:37,559
something we can apply Markov to okay

854
00:52:35,799 --> 00:52:41,040
less than or equal to the

855
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:45,160
expectation of R Prime

856
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,160
oops divided by

857
00:52:51,799 --> 00:52:57,640
x^2 okay does that make sense to

858
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,640
everybody

859
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:13,760
so let's take a look at an

860
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,040
example so let's look at those test

861
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:28,040
scores

862
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:28,040
again oops sorry my bad

863
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,280
so our same deal we've got test

864
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:53,640
scores

865
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:53,640
expectation is what did we have 70 75

866
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,680
75 and say that that the

867
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:05,319
variance is

868
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:08,000
25

869
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:13,040
okay so now what can we

870
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:16,040
say about the probability that R is uh

871
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,040
most

872
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,400
65 any

873
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,280
ideas how how could we how could we

874
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,280
apply treby Chef to

875
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:56,920
this that doesn't quite look like the

876
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,920
theorem statement right

877
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:05,319
but we can observe that this is at most

878
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,920
the

879
00:55:05,319 --> 00:55:10,680
probability that R is at most

880
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:15,359
65

881
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:15,359
or R is greater than or equal to

882
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:23,039
85

883
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:25,839
okay right if we take the union of two

884
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,400
events that Union has you know at least

885
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:29,359
the probability ility of one of those

886
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:31,720
two con constituent

887
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:34,680
events so this is only increasing the

888
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,839
probability if we add in this this extra

889
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,839
you

890
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:43,240
know extra half of the

891
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,240
event

892
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,400
okay and what do we know about this

893
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:58,880
probability how could we rewrite that in

894
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,880
a nicer

895
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,520
way

896
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,319
yeah

897
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:18,640
exactly so this is just saying R

898
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:18,640
deviates from its mean by at least 10

899
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,359
okay so now we've got it in the form

900
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:36,079
that chubby CHF

901
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:40,599
likes so we can apply chabby

902
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,599
Chev this is at most variance of

903
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,119
r divided

904
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:49,720
by uh our threshold is 10 yeah 10

905
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:56,119
squ okay

906
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,760
25 over 100

907
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:09,760
equals

908
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,760
one4

909
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,720
okay

910
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:22,520
now we've got a much stronger bound this

911
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,520
time than we did earlier Yeah question

912
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:34,839
ah okay so explain this

913
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:37,680
equality okay uh so R less than or equal

914
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:42,039
to 65 or R greater than or equal to

915
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:46,760
85 um we could rewrite this as you know

916
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:46,760
R minus uh well r -

917
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:57,039
75 is uh less than or equal to -10 and

918
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,880
this one is r - 75

919
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:02,119
greater than or equal to positive

920
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:04,799
10 okay um so you know if you absolute

921
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:06,440
value both of these you know they're

922
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,799
both you know greater than greater than

923
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:12,559
or equal to 10 okay does does that kind

924
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,559
of make sense

925
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:19,799
okay any other questions about uh about

926
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,799
this this example

927
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,200
so because we have more information than

928
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:34,160
we

929
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:39,119
had here right we can get a stronger

930
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:39,119
bound okay knowing the variance helps us

931
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:53,640
out so equivalently we could you know

932
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,920
rephrase this in terms of uh you know

933
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,319
standard

934
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,880
deviations uh um where would be a good

935
00:58:57,319 --> 00:59:01,280
place to write

936
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,839
this how about

937
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,839
here so the

938
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:12,400
probability of

939
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:12,400
being at least two standard

940
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:17,799
deviations from the

941
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:27,039
mean is at most

942
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:27,039
1/4 okay

943
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:47,480
does anybody have any objections to that

944
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,480
last statement

945
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,039
so if you've uh taken a stats class you

946
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,280
probably heard something very different

947
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:16,280
from

948
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:25,400
that oh nobody nobody's taken

949
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,960
stats that's good high school stats is

950
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:30,359
terrible um um oh that's on camera um

951
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:31,760
never mind stats are great just uh it's

952
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:33,760
it's good that that you've saved it for

953
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,520
University instead of doing it in high

954
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:40,039
school

955
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:42,680
um okay so yeah if if you're looking at

956
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:44,280
a a you know a normal distribution right

957
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:46,039
you actually have a much a much better

958
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:48,280
bound than than 1/4 it's something like

959
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:52,200
you know a few

960
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:56,400
percent okay uh so why is

961
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,400
that any ideas

962
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:04,520
well for normal distribution right we

963
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,839
know a lot more about the uh about the

964
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:11,160
random variable than just its

965
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:12,520
variance okay so if we know more even

966
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,359
more about a random variable than its

967
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,839
variance it turns out we can make even

968
01:01:14,359 --> 01:01:19,400
stronger

969
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:21,720
statements okay just like adding in the

970
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:25,720
variance was an upgrade from marov let's

971
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,720
see how we can upgrade this again

972
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,520
yeah what's upal distrib oh what's a

973
01:01:39,319 --> 01:01:44,280
normal distribution uh think of a normal

974
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,599
distribution as um you know number of

975
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:48,240
heads if you flip a whole bunch of coins

976
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:50,240
it's that's not quite it but you know

977
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:53,440
roughly

978
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,440
speaking good

979
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,119
cutch oh okay

980
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,640
um

981
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,640
so

982
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:19,920
okay so yeah as I just said if you flip

983
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:23,039
a whole bunch of coins let your random

984
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:26,480
variable R be the the number of heads

985
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:28,319
right uh you know a lot more about uh

986
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,960
about this random variable than just its

987
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:35,039
variance right you're you can decompose

988
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:36,160
the random variable into a sum of a

989
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,240
whole bunch of

990
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:40,559
indicators okay and all of those

991
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,160
indicators are mutually

992
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:44,960
independent

993
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:47,480
okay

994
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,880
um in order to use chubby Chev right you

995
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,119
don't need Mutual Independence right if

996
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,559
you had something of that form you just

997
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,279
need parir wise Independence right like

998
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:56,480
you need to compute the

999
01:02:54,279 --> 01:02:58,599
variance okay

1000
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,200
but if on top of that you have mutual

1001
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:01,920
Independence it turns out you can do a

1002
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:06,079
lot

1003
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,079
better okay so

1004
01:03:07,799 --> 01:03:10,799
suppose

1005
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:24,400
uh T1 T2

1006
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:24,400
T3 up to TN are mutually independent

1007
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:37,520
random

1008
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:39,640
variables and uh well let's say in

1009
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:42,640
addition they're

1010
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,640
bounded

1011
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:55,839
um

1012
01:03:53,160 --> 01:04:00,160
okay and the random variable we actually

1013
01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:00,160
care about is T which is their

1014
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,880
sum

1015
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,400
okay

1016
01:04:16,799 --> 01:04:23,160
then oh and uh say we've also got some

1017
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:26,920
threshold C which is at least

1018
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:32,200
one uh the probability

1019
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:32,200
that t is at least c times its

1020
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:43,000
expectation uh close that as well less

1021
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:48,799
than or equal to e to the

1022
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:50,640
negative C log of C minus C +

1023
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:53,200
1

1024
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:57,400
times uh the

1025
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:57,400
expectation of t

1026
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:08,039
okay so a little bit of a

1027
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,119
mouthful but what exactly is going on

1028
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:30,440
here so basically marov was saying right

1029
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:32,440
uh that the the probability that you you

1030
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,240
know deviate from from the mean by a

1031
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:36,760
large

1032
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:39,559
amount uh it's at most you

1033
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:41,440
know it's at most linear in in you know

1034
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:44,839
how how far you're you're you're

1035
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,960
deviating okay Chev said it's uh you

1036
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:50,640
know at most quadratic this is saying

1037
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:53,000
it's at most exponential or like inverse

1038
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,559
exponential okay so you have a much

1039
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,640
stronger condition that gives you a much

1040
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,640
stronger bound

1041
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:02,520
okay uh and how could we prove

1042
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,160
it not like this

1043
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:57,520
any ideas

1044
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:18,599
maybe a proof sketch we we won't go

1045
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,599
through the entire proof

1046
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:32,760
so what what tools do we have already

1047
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,760
what might we be able to do

1048
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:06,119
well what happens if we apply

1049
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,920
Markov how can we apply

1050
01:08:13,319 --> 01:08:19,920
Markov in order to use Markov right we

1051
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,920
need a non- negative random

1052
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:28,239
variable so in order to prove chubby

1053
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:30,520
right we uh you know took a square that

1054
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:32,440
made something non-

1055
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:35,199
negative what might be a reasonable

1056
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,199
thing to try in this

1057
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,839
case

1058
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:56,199
yeah add

1059
01:08:52,839 --> 01:09:01,040
one uh okay so

1060
01:08:56,199 --> 01:09:01,040
look at t + one instead of uh instead of

1061
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:11,679
T so that's actually going to that's not

1062
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:13,640
going to help us right T is already the

1063
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:18,400
sum of a bunch of non- negative random

1064
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:21,120
variables so it's already non- negative

1065
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:23,480
right like we're we're not looking to

1066
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:25,159
you know turn a non- negative or sorry

1067
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:28,000
turn an arbitrary random variable into a

1068
01:09:25,159 --> 01:09:29,040
non negative one we are trying to find a

1069
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,679
more

1070
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:35,120
useful uh non- negative random

1071
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:37,199
variable okay

1072
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:43,080
yeah

1073
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:43,080
yeah take the log of both sides close

1074
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,560
what happens if we

1075
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:16,640
exponentiate

1076
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:16,640
so take T Prime equals c to the T

1077
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,040
what do we know about t

1078
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:58,280
Prime for

1079
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:34,320
well we're taking something that's at

1080
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:36,520
least one right or you know raising it

1081
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:38,760
to some positive power well some non-

1082
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:41,760
negative

1083
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,760
power

1084
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,560
okay so T Prime is a non negative random

1085
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:52,560
variable

1086
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,320
do we know anything more about

1087
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:20,440
it yeah it's at least one

1088
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:20,440
yeah so maybe we try applying markup to

1089
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,679
this okay so now we've got a random

1090
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:32,960
variable that takes values in the range

1091
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:32,960
from 0 to uh C the n c the N minus

1092
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:38,960
one

1093
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:42,400
okay now how could we rewrite this

1094
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:49,679
condition T greater than or equal to C

1095
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:49,679
* expectation of T in terms of T Prime

1096
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:18,320
well because C is at least one

1097
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:20,679
right exponentiation is

1098
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:23,520
monotone so this is the same as you know

1099
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:26,960
C to the T greater than or equal to uh C

1100
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,960
to the C *

1101
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,199
expectation of

1102
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,560
T

1103
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:57,520
okay and we don't have too much time so

1104
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,679
I think I will refer you to the book if

1105
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:03,199
you are interested but the the main idea

1106
01:14:00,679 --> 01:14:06,400
right

1107
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:08,560
is this step here

1108
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:11,360
okay you take the random variable you

1109
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:14,920
care about and you exponentiate

1110
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:18,040
it okay and then if you apply apply

1111
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:19,880
Markov to that right it actually gives

1112
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:22,040
you a much stronger bound like you know

1113
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:24,000
if you're if you're using the the mutal

1114
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:25,639
independence of all of the component

1115
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,760
random variables

1116
01:14:25,639 --> 01:14:30,560
right this will give you a much stronger

1117
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:33,560
bound than uh than even Shoff okay so I

1118
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:36,360
promised you last week that uh you know

1119
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:38,960
we would revisit the uh the coin tosses

1120
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:43,840
so let's do that

1121
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,840
briefly okay so

1122
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:51,639
suppose R is the

1123
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:56,440
number of

1124
01:14:51,639 --> 01:14:56,440
heads uh if you flip end coins

1125
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,199
okay so if you recall we were looking at

1126
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,440
uh the

1127
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:16,639
probability that R is uh equal to you

1128
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:19,000
know n

1129
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:23,600
over4

1130
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:25,840
before okay so or maybe

1131
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:28,679
equivalently three over

1132
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:31,120
4 might be a better way to

1133
01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:34,440
to

1134
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:35,320
analogize okay and I promised you that

1135
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:38,120
we would

1136
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:41,400
revisit this probability R greater than

1137
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:41,400
or equal to 3 n /

1138
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:45,719
4

1139
01:15:52,560 --> 01:16:00,960
okay now what happens if we apply

1140
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:00,960
uh each of our three tail bounds to

1141
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,800
R well first what happens with

1142
01:16:20,639 --> 01:16:25,440
Markov so let's call this p

1143
01:16:29,639 --> 01:16:32,480
p is at most

1144
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:57,560
what well the probability that R is at

1145
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:01,199
least you know some

1146
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:03,040
threshold it's going to be the

1147
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:07,080
expectation of

1148
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:07,080
r divided by this

1149
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:13,080
threshold okay what's the expectation of

1150
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:13,080
R and over

1151
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:23,679
two

1152
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,679
okay so this is going to be 2/3

1153
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,120
what about chubby

1154
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,760
shf so similar to what we did with the

1155
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,760
first chbby Chev

1156
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:54,400
example right p is going to be at most

1157
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:56,520
the probability that uh R differs from

1158
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:59,760
its it expectation in either

1159
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:01,320
direction right by

1160
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:07,480
n/4

1161
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:12,920
okay so what does that give us uh

1162
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:12,920
probability R minus let's say over

1163
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:20,239
two

1164
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,239
uh greater than or equal to n

1165
01:18:20,679 --> 01:18:26,920
over4 is at most

1166
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:32,679
bar of

1167
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:32,679
r divided by uh n over 4^

1168
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:44,760
s okay so what is the uh what is the

1169
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:44,760
variance of r

1170
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,320
does anybody

1171
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:06,520
remember we've got a sum of a bunch of

1172
01:19:03,159 --> 01:19:09,080
indicators right they're all mutually

1173
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:13,120
independent so the variance is

1174
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:13,120
linear what's the variance of a single

1175
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:24,920
indicator

1176
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:27,400
nobody yeah

1177
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:28,880
yeah n over four oh for for R not for a

1178
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,840
single

1179
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:35,679
one

1180
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:38,280
okay so n over 4 / n^2 over

1181
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:40,199
16 equal 4

1182
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:43,320
n

1183
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:45,320
okay so much better right much better

1184
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:50,040
than the 2/3 we just

1185
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:50,040
got what happens if we use turnoff

1186
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:17,800
okay any

1187
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:21,159
ideas

1188
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:23,000
yeah plug in three halves for C so c

1189
01:20:21,159 --> 01:20:26,639
equal 3

1190
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,639
Hales okay

1191
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:36,960
uh okay um why don't I uh put TR off

1192
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,960
back up

1193
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:48,120
here

1194
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,120
uh

1195
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:57,480
okay and what does that give us

1196
01:20:51,920 --> 01:21:00,760
probability that uh R is is at least 3es

1197
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,760
time expectation of

1198
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:10,159
R is less than or equal to e to the

1199
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:10,159
minus is it C log

1200
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:20,560
C minus C + 1 so this is a constant

1201
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:22,440
times the expectation of

1202
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:25,880
R

1203
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:29,880
okay so the expectation of r R is n

1204
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:32,040
/2 right this is a constant so we've got

1205
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:34,639
something that's exponential or inverse

1206
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,639
exponential in

1207
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:40,400
N oops

1208
01:21:41,639 --> 01:21:50,000
uh e to the minus order

1209
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
n

1210
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:58,239
okay so marov gives us gave us a really

1211
01:21:54,239 --> 01:22:01,320
bad found chabby Chev you know

1212
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:02,239
linear pretty reasonable turn off gives

1213
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:04,719
us

1214
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:06,480
exponential okay so that's all we have

1215
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:08,199
time for today sorry I went a little bit

1216
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:11,600
overtime uh it's been a pleasure

1217
01:22:08,199 --> 01:22:13,400
teaching you all this semester um and uh

1218
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:16,040
let's see we have uh the rest of our

1219
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:18,800
instructors and at least one ta hello

1220
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:21,480
Lily uh yeah if anything went wrong it

1221
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:23,400
was probably my fault um anything that

1222
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:26,639
went right uh you have your Tas to thank

1223
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:29,400
for it um including Lily ly Lily's

1224
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:33,560
amazing um so yeah perhaps I will see

1225
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:35,159
some of you uh next term in uh in 61 121

1226
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:38,080
um good luck on the final make sure you

1227
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:39,560
take the right one uh thanks for being

1228
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:41,560
students in this class it's been lots of

1229
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:48,069
fun yeah

1230
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:48,069
[Applause]
