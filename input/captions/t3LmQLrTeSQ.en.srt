1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,839
It is my pleasure to kick off the

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,639
starting the lightning talks with

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,519
today's first presentation introducing

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,599
Kate Rosner of Medis. Medis is applying

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,840
AI and machine learning to revolutionize

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,840
drug discovery and delivery. Welcoming

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,560
to the

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,400
stage Kate Rosner.

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,519
Hi everybody and thank you Trisha and

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,119
ILP for hosting us today. Um my name is

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,440
Kate Rosner. I'm going to be presenting

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,600
a quick overview of Medis's

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,280
capabilities. So, uh, Medis aims to

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,879
integrate artificial intelligence,

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,280
machine learning, molecular dynamics,

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,879
and high throughput invivo screening to

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,399
develop novel genetic medicines

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,640
particularly um in the pursuit of uh

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,559
easing delivery issues. Uh, we are

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,719
founded in 2019 by three MIT alumni. Um,

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,000
and this mission has allowed us to raise

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,520
over $300 million through our series C

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,840
round. Uh, Jacob actually this morning

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,640
gave a really good introduction into why

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,479
AI is a really good uh application or

26
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,040
why LMPS are a really good application

27
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,799
for AI and machine learning. Um, there's

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,439
a really large design space when it

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,439
comes to LMPS. You can design chemically

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,560
each individual component of the LMP,

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,360
but you also can optimize the LMP

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,840
particle as a whole by adjusting the

33
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,680
proportions and ratios of the different

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,119
uh components within the particle. So

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,439
that creates a really large

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,920
combinatorial explosion problem makes it

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,439
really difficult to design these LMPS

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,479
optimally with just traditional

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,720
experimentation or

40
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,640
DOE. So we use AI, machine learning,

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,680
other computational tools to solve that

42
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,600
problem. Um this all begins with our

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,000
lipid library. It's over a million

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,000
different lipids. Um not just ionizable

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,640
lipids. Um but it also includes other

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,880
components of an L&P. Um this is all in

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,439
silicone and it was uh generated denovo

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,360
by machine learning algorithms. Um

49
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,280
obviously we can't synthesize millions

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,439
of lipids. So we have uh insilic AI and

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,440
molecular dynamics filters to allow us

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,520
to quickly screen through these lipids

53
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,400
um and other LMP components to identify

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,599
which would make the optimal LMP for

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,360
delivering to a target um tissue of

56
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,840
interest. And then finally we use

57
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,720
artificial intelligence to uh predict

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,520
the optimal formulation as well to best

59
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,840
tune these um LMPS for efficacy to

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,640
delivering to these difficult to reach

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,120
uh tissues.

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,080
Like most LMP companies, we began with

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,120
developing liver targeting LMPS. So we

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,680
have liver LMPS that uh have better

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,840
delivery than Madna's lipid 5 which is

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,000
kind of like the industry gold standard.

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,519
Um and this uh portfolio of liver LMPS

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,120
that we have actually supports our

69
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,720
internal pipeline which is primarily

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,599
focused in oncology. Um so this MTS 105

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,800
is one example of our pipeline. Um it is

72
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,720
an liver targeted LMP that encapsulates

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,560
mRNA which encodes for T- cell engaging

74
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,440
SCFVS. Um this is for the treatment of

75
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,280
paceellular carcinoma. Um in vivo we've

76
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,440
seen significant tumor shrinkage with

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,920
this therapeutic and we actually have

78
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,159
finally dosed in um humans in an

79
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,080
investigator initiated trial um that is

80
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,159
still ongoing. So that's very exciting.

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,560
But beyond the liver, we've also

82
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,599
developed um an extra hypatic targeting

83
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,519
L&P portfolio um that is allows us to

84
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,959
target a number of difficultto-reach

85
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,440
tissues with our LMPS. Um so we have CNS

86
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,599
targeted L&PS that can be administered

87
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:48,280
by intratheal or ICM administration. Um

88
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:51,680
in the slide you'll see we have um ICM

89
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,120
administration of uh TD tomato mRNA. RNA

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,720
scope shows that we're seeing really

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,280
widespread distribution throughout the

92
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,720
brain including to deep brain regions.

93
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,080
Um we also have lung targeting LNPS via

94
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,920
IV administration. Um we have seen

95
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,879
better delivery and more specific

96
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,680
delivery to the lung uh versus the liver

97
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,239
and spleen. Um in comparison to sort

98
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,320
LMPS which are the basis for recodes uh

99
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,840
foundational

100
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,600
technology. And finally, our kind of

101
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,880
like breakthrough really unique

102
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,479
technology is IV administered skeletal

103
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,199
and cardiac muscle targeting L&PS. Um,

104
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,880
these give us a lot of opportunity to

105
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,240
potentially help patients with

106
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,520
significant with diseases with

107
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,479
significant unmet need. We're thinking

108
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,919
like musculardrophes or

109
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:41,199
cardiomyopathies. Um, it's really

110
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,800
exciting data. So, I know it was a lot

111
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,040
to get through in a very short period of

112
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,040
time, but I'm open to hearing from any

113
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,560
of you. Please come find me at the end

114
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,080
of this. I'll be happy to talk more

115
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,759
about what our um company is doing. Um

116
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,560
something I wasn't able to get to here

117
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,600
is we actually have an AI empowered mRNA

118
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,880
uh platform as well. Um and we are

119
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,000
always looking for external

120
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,080
collaborators um on any of the

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,479
technology that I've shown you today. So

122
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,479
thank you all.
