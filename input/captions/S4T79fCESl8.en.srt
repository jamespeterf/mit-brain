1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,960
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,759
I can see a lot of you are here today.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,920
Welcome. This is our

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,719
uh curriculum overview for the Master

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,440
Business Analytics program. My name is

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,960
Michelle Lee and I'm the director of

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,640
this program. I've been the director

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,279
since the beginning in 2016 when we

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,080
launched and right now we're in our 10th

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,119
year. So, it's our 10year anniversary.

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm joined today by our colleagues Anna,

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,559
Jen, and Mina um in the admissions

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,600
office as well as our program office.

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,399
And u feel free to ask questions as I go

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,640
along. I'm just going to share a few

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,000
slides um and then you can ask me

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,280
questions um and we'll try our best to

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,280
get everything answered for you.

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,760
Um great. So I just wanted to start with

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:01:00,000
sharing an overview of MIT. MIT is a

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:04,320
really big place and Sloan is one of six

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,920
colleges um inside MIT. So we have the

23
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,720
master business program inside

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,880
management but we also have students

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,159
across our university in the science

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,200
department shass which is our urban

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,119
planning um and the college of computing

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,759
which is our newest college the

29
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,840
Schwarzman center um architecture and

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,280
planning and finally our engineering

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,479
flagship school.

32
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,439
Um so within the management program is

33
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,479
our business analytics program. It was

34
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,040
launched as I said in 2016. It's been

35
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,560
ranked uh the number one program in the

36
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,000
world um luckily uh since the beginning

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,600
and we are a STEM classified program. Um

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,240
it's a one-year onampus

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,079
full-time program. So we do not offer

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,280
any online components. students come to

41
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,439
campus and stay on campus um for the one

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,560
year.

43
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,920
This is the breakdown of our student

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,680
body. This year we have 80 students. Um

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:16,000
we've had a steady state of 80 since

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,959
2023. Um and we do not expect to grow um

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,840
in the near future. So next year we're

48
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,440
looking for a class of 80 students as

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,959
well. Um we have a good mix of countries

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,760
over 29 countries represented. Um very

51
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,879
high GPA a good balance of female to

52
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,879
male um and very technical undergraduate

53
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,879
degrees.

54
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,200
So the overall mission of the program is

55
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,760
to combine machine learning and

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,720
operations research to arrive at data

57
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,920
models and decisions to allow for

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,519
predictions and prescriptive analytics.

59
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:01,040
So the unique aspect of our program is

60
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,440
that we really do focus on optimization

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,440
in combination with machine learning. We

62
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,080
do teach deep learning, genai, we teach

63
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,720
statistical inference, but the core of

64
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,400
our program is lies in machine learning

65
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,440
and operations research.

66
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,920
This is a map of the one-year program. I

67
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,519
know this is a lot of text on one slide,

68
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,760
but all you need to think about is

69
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,920
there's the fall semester on the left,

70
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,599
the spring semester in the middle, and

71
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,319
then the summer semester on the right

72
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,480
hand side. The students take a really

73
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,080
full set of courses in the fall. There's

74
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,640
really no time for anything else. We

75
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,200
keep trying to add more courses, but uh

76
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,040
I think they're really maxed out here.

77
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,120
So, they're taking analytics tools,

78
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,000
which is programming in R and Python,

79
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,120
Julia, SQL, optimization methods,

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,360
machine learning. Um these are all our

81
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,799
foundational courses in machine learning

82
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,560
and AI. Um the analytics lab which you

83
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,799
can see is the 9 unit 572 course is a

84
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,159
more hands-on training course. So that's

85
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,000
more uh projectbased students work in

86
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,680
teams of three to four students with a

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,040
company. Uh and before this uh webinar I

88
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,799
was just uh talking to some companies

89
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,759
that have done a lab in the past for

90
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,840
example like Wayfair and um General

91
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,520
Motors and Disney for example. So

92
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,759
companies come and do projects with our

93
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,240
students, but students are also taking

94
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,759
our typical engineering type courses

95
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,360
like machine learning and optim

96
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,479
optimization

97
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,400
which are more traditional courses. So

98
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,440
you're in a lecture room and students

99
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,919
are taking um exams during the semester.

100
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,000
There's midterms coming up uh soon in

101
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,440
two weeks. And then they also have

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,120
weekly problem sets and um final

103
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,759
projects and final exams.

104
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,680
Um students do have to maintain a 4.5

105
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:05,360
GPA out of five. MIT is on a 5.0 system.

106
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,320
So a five is an A and a four is a B. An

107
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,800
A minus is still a five and a B+ is

108
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,720
still a four. So you just need to get

109
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,800
half A's and half B's in order to

110
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,039
graduate from the program. We haven't

111
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,680
had anyone come through the program who

112
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,680
have not graduated.

113
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,919
Okay. Again, if you're just joining us,

114
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,320
feel free to ask me questions and Anna

115
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,320
or Mina will let me know. There are

116
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,880
questions. I'll try my best to answer

117
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,639
them. Um, so one part of the uh the map,

118
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,199
the timeline that I just showed you is

119
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,479
the analytics capstone project. It is a

120
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,280
majority uh of the program. It's seven

121
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,520
months out of the 12 months. So, it is

122
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,160
really the defining characteristic of

123
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:55,840
our master's program. It's a required

124
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,520
uh industry analytics course where

125
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,880
students work in teams of two with a

126
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,280
faculty advisor on an industry project.

127
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,479
The companies pay for these projects and

128
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,800
they fund your tuition. So this the

129
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,960
students tuition is partially funded by

130
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,400
the capstone project and the students

131
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,479
then travel to the location of the

132
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,479
company in the summer to work on these

133
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,560
projects. At the end of the summer, the

134
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,800
students come back to MIT campus,

135
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,639
present their final projects, and attend

136
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,520
a graduation ceremony at the end of

137
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,360
August. For some sample projects, you

138
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,800
can visit our website. They're all

139
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,800
listed there, analytics capstone.edu.

140
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,880
Um again here's our required core in

141
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,520
very minute detail if you're interested.

142
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:48,319
Um again this is a curriculum uh

143
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,639
overview webinar uh and so we're trying

144
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,479
to go through the curriculum as much as

145
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,039
possible. There'll be other webinars

146
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,280
about career and capstone and student

147
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,880
life but this one is focused on the

148
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,759
curriculum.

149
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,599
Um so fall core uh the students are

150
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,199
taking the top list of courses. I know

151
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,759
it seems like a lot of courses and it

152
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,160
is. Students are working, you know, 60

153
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,319
80 hours a week on these courses. Um,

154
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,680
and then if those courses are easy for

155
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,919
them or they want to challenge

156
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,759
themselves even more, they can take one

157
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,759
additional elective course, any elective

158
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,639
that's offered at MIT at the graduate

159
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,639
level. Um, and then students can engage

160
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,880
in research.

161
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,360
Um if students are engaging in research

162
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,560
with faculty then they are not permitted

163
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,240
to take an elective in the January

164
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,479
period. Students are taking the

165
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,639
analytics capstone a communications

166
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:45,280
course. We also offer a data ethics and

167
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,199
data privacy course in the January

168
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,599
period. Um so MIT is broken into fall,

169
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,759
January, spring and summer where in

170
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,479
January there are no regular courses

171
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,479
held at MIT. So January is called

172
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,479
independent activities period and during

173
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,319
the whole month of January there is

174
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,759
special um courses offered and we offer

175
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,879
these four courses. Um but most of the

176
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,879
campus or the rest of MIT is not on

177
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,199
campus for that winter break. And then

178
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,360
in spring which starts in February

179
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,160
students are taking the capstone project

180
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,360
continued uh with their with their

181
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,919
required mandatory courses. And then

182
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,960
spring is the time where students can

183
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:34,159
take electives that interest them. So

184
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,680
they have to take at least 27 electives

185
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,959
and up to 40 maximum units. Um 27 has to

186
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,720
be approved technical electives and then

187
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,040
up to 21 additional units or 48 max can

188
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,360
be any elective that you want. Some

189
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,760
students also take electives at Harvard.

190
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,600
um cross registration is permitted

191
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,519
between Harvard and MIT. Um so Harvard

192
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,120
students can take MIT courses and MIT

193
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,600
students can take Harvard courses and a

194
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,920
lot of students do try to do that as

195
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,160
well. Um and then in the summer there's

196
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,519
only one course it's the capstone course

197
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,560
and students go either abroad or travel

198
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,760
to do their capstone.

199
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,320
Are there any questions?

200
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,800
No. Okay.

201
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,080
Um, here's a sample schedule for the

202
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:28,240
fall semester. Um, this year it's kind

203
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,399
of crazy because the first course 15681

204
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,959
only meets on certain days um because

205
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,040
the professor travels from Morocco um

206
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,720
every other week to teach the students.

207
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,480
So these are just this is a special

208
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,320
course. All the other courses you see

209
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:46,080
here are regularly scheduled every week.

210
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,920
Um so uh there are many gaps. Um you

211
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,560
know there aren't courses offered during

212
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,600
lunch but there are courses offered um

213
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,279
from 8:30 a.m. until

214
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,959
5:30 p.m. sometimes until 700 p.m. Um

215
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,040
and then Fridays are held for

216
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,839
recitation. So students do not have

217
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,519
lecture on Fridays. They have recitation

218
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,519
on Fridays and then other special

219
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,680
activities. Um so this is just an

220
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,080
example schedule of our students for

221
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,760
this fall. Of course, in the spring, the

222
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,920
schedule doesn't look like this. It's

223
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,959
very different based on what students

224
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,959
choose to take as their elective.

225
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:28,399
Um, and then there's some special um uh

226
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,720
analytics um events that we hold for our

227
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,560
students. For example, we have a class

228
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,880
ball retreat where we take the students

229
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,480
up into the mountains of New Hampshire

230
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,680
for two two nights and they go and um do

231
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,880
some teen bonding and go hiking and get

232
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:48,399
to know each other better. Um we also do

233
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,320
a spring trek to New York City. Um this

234
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:56,079
year it's going to be March 18th to the

235
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:58,800
20th. Um, and then we have um

236
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,120
some breaks throughout the semester for

237
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,760
our standard holidays. Um, there's a

238
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,240
fall Sloan intensive period and then a

239
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,720
spring Sloan intensive period as well.

240
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,560
Um, it's not really intensive. It's a

241
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,800
it's a strange name to call it. It's

242
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,880
just really a week where classes are not

243
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,680
in session and we do other activities

244
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,079
for the class. And like I said, um,

245
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,000
graduation is at the end of August each

246
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,920
year, which is different to other

247
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,760
programs that you may be applying to.

248
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,560
Um, most programs graduate at the end of

249
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,040
May or June, and ours, um, the students

250
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,800
graduate at the end of August, and most

251
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,680
students start working in the fall. So,

252
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:42,160
full-time hiring, they will start in

253
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,839
October or November or December.

254
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,839
Um, these are some of our faculty that

255
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,160
teach our courses. Dimmitri Bertimas.

256
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,839
He's the associate dean and now he's

257
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,640
also the vice provost. I guess we should

258
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,440
update this slide. Is a vice provost for

259
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,240
open learning at MIT. Um so he's in

260
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,040
charge of both all online education at

261
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,480
MIT as well as business analytics and

262
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,160
he's the faculty director of our

263
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,399
program. Um, Alex Yakiat teaches a lot

264
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,399
of operations research and statistics

265
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,639
and transportation um topics and he his

266
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,920
research is in transportation

267
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:21,279
um as well as um traditional O. Uh,

268
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:27,760
Rahul teaches the analytics edge course

269
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:30,880
and um he has a very famous um paper on

270
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,279
um soft compute that he is well known

271
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,360
for. So if you look him up, he's an

272
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,399
incredible professor as well as

273
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:42,160
researcher. Um Georgia Barakus, she's on

274
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:45,839
um sbatical this year at Harvard. Um but

275
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,320
she will be back next year um at MIT. Uh

276
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,160
she does re research in retail and

277
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,639
online platforms. She works with

278
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,839
companies like Zara, Wayfair um um all

279
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:01,040
the online platform strategy um pricing

280
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,680
strategy companies. Um and then Karen

281
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,519
Zang is our amazing professor who works

282
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:12,880
a lot on health care systems and um

283
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:14,880
social impact projects. Um and um she's

284
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,000
gone to

285
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:22,480
uh Africa to work on some healthcare

286
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,279
delivery systems um for those countries.

287
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,360
So amazing slate of professors and if

288
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:30,320
you are interested in doing research uh

289
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,120
com students do uh like doing research

290
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,600
with our variety of professors. Um the

291
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,760
maximum hours is 10 hours per week

292
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,279
because they're taking a very heavy

293
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,519
course load in the fall and spring. Um

294
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,000
and the research assistantships are

295
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,440
funded. So they will go towards paying

296
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:54,560
down tuition. It is approximately

297
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,639
$12,000 in funding if you choose to

298
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:02,160
uh conduct a research assistantship at

299
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:06,720
MIT. Um so that's very helpful for a lot

300
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,040
of students who um need that funding.

301
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,040
Here are some additional uh topics. So I

302
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,880
must say that the the research topics

303
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:19,360
have now um shifted to more generative

304
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:22,880
AI large language models and um less

305
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,720
traditional O topics but um that's

306
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,800
really what you're interested in. So if

307
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,560
you're you're saying oh I really want to

308
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:34,000
see um you know I really want to look at

309
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,480
food safety in in developing countries

310
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,959
for example that's up to the students to

311
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,440
say okay these are the faculty working

312
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:45,839
on these problems and that's who I want

313
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,839
to work with for my RA ship.

314
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,600
Uh this is a class profile of this

315
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,199
year's class. And if you join our other

316
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,920
webinars, we do have some of um our

317
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,519
alumni and current students attending

318
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,880
future webinars. I do encourage you to

319
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,639
um come and and talk to them. Um there

320
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,560
are 80 students and I think I went

321
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,240
through the statistics here so you don't

322
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm not going to read them to you again.

323
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,320
They're on our website.

324
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,519
Um, and then I'll turn it over to Anna

325
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,040
who has any logistics about our upcoming

326
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,440
events, but you can scan the QR code it

327
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,000
um to register. Um, I do think there's

328
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,680
an onampus event where you can meet me

329
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,360
in person. Um,

330
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,839
it looks like it's October 7th and

331
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,279
November 12th, but I'm not sure. So,

332
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,760
Anna, take it away.

333
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,160
>> Yes. So, we have a lot of upcoming um

334
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,240
events directed for business of an

335
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,120
business analytics and these aren't even

336
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,440
all of them. Um so, definitely feel free

337
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,839
to scan the QR code um to see the full

338
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,519
list of upcoming events. Um and you will

339
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,519
get the chance to meet Michelle on

340
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:00,079
campus on November 12th for business

341
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,880
analytics preview day. Yeah.

342
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:06,800
>> Great. So, that's all the slides that we

343
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,920
had. Um, I guess we'll just turn it over

344
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,279
to you for any specific questions and I

345
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,720
can go through. Yeah.

346
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,800
>> Yeah. So, we did have a couple of

347
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,560
questions in the chat for you, Michelle.

348
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,880
Um, so one person asked um if while in

349
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,600
the program um are they also able to

350
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,040
take some action learning courses um in

351
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,360
addition to the capstone project?

352
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,120
>> Uh yes. So, you can definitely take

353
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,759
action learning courses as part of your

354
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,959
electives. Um so a lot of our students

355
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,399
will take um product management courses

356
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,560
because there's a product management

357
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,040
certificate. So you can definitely

358
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,360
enroll for product management lab or

359
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,000
other labs if it fits into your you know

360
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,759
you design your spring schedule. So

361
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,040
there's definitely options. And in the

362
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,880
fall some students have taken

363
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,399
entrepreneurship lab. So if you're

364
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,920
interested in starting your own company

365
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,079
in the future or if you have started

366
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,800
your own company and you need help

367
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,560
that's a great lab to join. Um and you

368
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,319
know that's you can definitely take

369
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,640
those classes.

370
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,679
>> Great. Thank you. Um, and someone else

371
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,439
asked if there are any opportunities for

372
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,600
students to do research while they're in

373
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,760
the program.

374
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,559
>> Oh, yes. This person must have missed my

375
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,880
entire um summary about the research

376
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,880
assistantships, but that's no problem.

377
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,280
Um, yeah, so you can definitely do

378
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,839
research. Um, tons of students do

379
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,440
research. I think over 40% of our

380
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:34,640
student body do uh does a research

381
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,039
um assistantship. So here is the summary

382
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,760
of the research assistantship. Students

383
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:44,720
apply in August um before uh starting

384
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,280
the program and

385
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,360
faculty will interview them and select

386
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,440
them to hire them as a research

387
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,360
assistant. Students work 10 hours per

388
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,360
week from fall semester until spring

389
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,240
semester and they're paid roughly

390
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,480
$12,000.

391
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,559
Thanks, Michelle. Um, and so we know

392
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,640
that today's session is geared towards

393
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,400
the curriculum, but someone did have a

394
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,080
question asking if there's any

395
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,520
prerequisite courses that they should

396
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,440
take that will help them um prior to

397
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,320
being in the MBAN program.

398
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:22,160
>> Uh, yes, there are many prerequisites

399
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,080
that we recommend. Um

400
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,960
the most important prerequisite is

401
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,799
linear algebra. You have to take some

402
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,440
linear algebra whether it's an online

403
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,000
course or a full um undergraduate course

404
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,320
in linear algebra. Advanced mathematics

405
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,480
topics. Um differential equations is

406
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,240
also great to have um because these

407
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,480
classes in the fall are very very

408
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,400
technical. They start with your basic we

409
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,840
we basically assume knowledge of linear

410
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,000
algebra of statistics of probability um

411
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,039
when you come into the program um and

412
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
then just some basic coding

413
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:59,600
computer science courses um if you take

414
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,039
like algorithms or data structures um

415
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,400
that will also help um in your fall

416
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:10,320
core. Um a lot of our students have

417
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,520
taken SQL or Java or C++ or or something

418
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,840
to show that they have good uh computer

419
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,120
science knowledge. So I would say math

420
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,400
and computer science are the most

421
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,240
important two requisite two

422
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,880
prerequisites.

423
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,720
>> Awesome. Thank you. Um and then we have

424
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,120
someone who is curious to hear more

425
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,960
about what alternative activities they

426
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,880
can do outside of the curriculum at

427
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Sloan.

428
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,760
>> Oh yeah. Um there's lots of um so social

429
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,200
events, clubs, and activities. Um I'm

430
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,600
just showing you the 12-month schedule,

431
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,840
but within this schedule, students will

432
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,400
u participate in conferences. There is

433
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,120
the annual Sloan Sports Analytics

434
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,760
Conference, which is the largest sports

435
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,280
analytics conference in the world. I

436
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,600
went to the sports analytics conference

437
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,000
one year and I met President Obama at

438
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,320
the time and Michelle Obama was the

439
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,640
speaker the following year. So it would

440
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,679
it's a pretty big deal. Um and students

441
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,280
at Sloan can volunteer to organize these

442
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,320
conferences. There's other conferences

443
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,799
as well like the um I think there's an

444
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,440
Africa conference. Um there's a

445
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,080
technology and AI conference. There's a

446
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,360
product management conference. Um but

447
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,480
you don't have to do conferences.

448
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,400
There's also there's social like sports

449
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,960
intramural sports. We just had Sloan

450
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,120
Olympics. I mean the problem isn't that

451
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,799
there's not enough activities. There's

452
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,960
the problem is that there's too many

453
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,200
activities and students can't decide

454
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,440
what to do because there's too many to

455
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,440
choose from.

456
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,880
>> Thank you. And then another question um

457
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,080
was related to capstone which we will be

458
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,480
having a webinar um that focuses just on

459
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,480
capstone um so stay tuned for that but

460
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,559
the question was how does selection of

461
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,679
the company you work with for capstone

462
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,919
how does that process work? Um, sure.

463
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,320
Yeah. So, uh, you can see some of our

464
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,760
companies on our website, uh, if you go

465
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,559
to the website on this link here,

466
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,039
analytics capstone.edu,

467
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,440
we have returning companies each year.

468
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,320
So, each year we have about 40 40

469
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,559
companies and

470
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,240
many companies return year after year,

471
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,640
but we're also always looking for new

472
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,039
companies to come on board and and host

473
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,840
a project for our students.

474
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,360
Um, so it's just a submission process.

475
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,720
companies will submit a project and

476
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,480
we'll evaluate it and select them to be

477
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,600
part of the 40 each year.

478
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,919
>> Also got a question, Michelle, um about

479
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,080
health care and if students have can

480
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,400
take any healthcare analytics type

481
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,679
courses while they're at Sloan.

482
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,200
>> Oh yes, you can definitely take

483
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,200
healthcare courses. We have a lot of

484
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,600
healthcare the intersection of

485
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,200
healthcare and

486
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,400
u data science or healthcare machine

487
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,159
learning. There's actually a machine

488
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,600
learning in health. There's a course

489
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,520
that's called machine learning in

490
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,280
healthcare. You can Google it. It's

491
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,600
online. It's machine learning in

492
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,240
healthcare offered by MIT where students

493
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,400
work with doctors at hospitals to solve

494
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,440
a data science problem. It's more like a

495
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,280
project class. Um, but there are many

496
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,640
healthcare classes offered in MIT and

497
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,880
you can take them as part of your

498
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,880
electives list. Um, and you can also do

499
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,039
research in healthcare. Uh, for example,

500
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,960
Dimmitri Bertimas, one of the faculty I

501
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,679
I showed you before, has done a lot of

502
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,320
research in oncology and diabetes

503
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:31,200
research where he's helping doctors

504
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:35,720
classify certain symptoms um of patients

505
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,720
into different diagnosis.

506
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,039
>> Thank you.

507
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,320
I don't know.

508
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,440
>> Sorry.

509
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,360
>> Um, we had another question um asking

510
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,200
what the typical class schedule looks

511
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,919
like for MBAN students. Um, and so if

512
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,200
they spend most of their time inside the

513
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:58,640
classroom and what sort of amount of

514
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,280
time they have to do other activities.

515
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,200
>> Yeah, that's a great question. So, this

516
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,159
is a sample class schedule from this

517
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,039
fall. Currently, the students in this

518
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,799
class are doing this schedule um for the

519
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,000
fall semester. So, you can see there are

520
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:16,159
a lot of gaps in their schedule where

521
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,159
they're not in class, but a majority of

522
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,840
the learning does not happen in the in

523
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,559
the classroom. Actually, most of the

524
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,440
students come out of lectures being

525
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,880
really confused or, you know, very um

526
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,240
agitated because they're worried that

527
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,400
they didn't understand everything in the

528
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,559
lectures. And that's normal. A lot of

529
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,799
the students will learn in study groups

530
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,440
or outside the classroom where they

531
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,760
where they go to office hours or they go

532
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,360
to recitation and seek help from the

533
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,520
TAs. Um so I say like 80% of the

534
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,600
learning comes outside the classroom. Um

535
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,559
and then there's also speaker series

536
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,559
during lunch hours where

537
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,960
different clubs or the dean's office

538
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,520
will invite speakers to come and and

539
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,000
talk to the students. Um and then

540
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,400
there's the group work. So students are

541
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
always doing projects together. So when

542
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,080
you're doing projects, it's usually late

543
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,760
late at night or early in the morning or

544
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,080
during the gaps. So that's where the

545
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,080
learning happens.

546
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,600
Thank you. See what else we have.

547
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,760
Oh, there's a question about work

548
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,760
experience. You don't need to have any

549
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,400
work experience coming into the program,

550
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,880
but if you do have work experience,

551
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,640
that's not a negative, it's a positive.

552
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,320
um especially if the work experience is

553
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,480
related to data science or machine

554
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,240
learning or AI. Um so we don't have a um

555
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,200
like

556
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:44,919
I guess um requirements for number of

557
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,919
years of work experience.

558
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:56,039
Feel like there's more questions now

559
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,039
that I answered some.

560
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,559
See?

561
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,559
>> Okay.

562
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Uh,

563
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,799
there's some questions about linear

564
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,559
algebra. So, yeah, if you're a finance

565
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:17,440
major, you can still take linear algebra

566
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,640
or math matricy math or differential

567
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,600
equations online. You can, you know,

568
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,600
there's tons of online courses you can

569
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,600
take to show us that you know the

570
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,600
content.

571
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,360
We did get a question on how classes are

572
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,760
structured. So if they're more project

573
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,120
based, case study based, if you could

574
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,799
answer that. Oh yeah, it's a mix. So a

575
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,799
lot of the courses are traditional

576
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,120
engineering courses. So for example,

577
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,120
machine learning is you go to lecture,

578
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,760
there's problem sets every week, there's

579
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,200
a midterm or and a final one or final

580
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,559
project. This year there's two midterms

581
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,720
and no final, but there's a final

582
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:58,400
project. So that's the that's the

583
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,400
traditional machine learning and um

584
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,240
analytics edge classes. The other

585
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,880
classes you can see here at the top is

586
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,640
the analytics to action. That's a more

587
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,520
communications course and business

588
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,200
course. So it's case study based. It's a

589
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,159
past fail course. So all you have to do

590
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,640
is attend. Um then the analytics lab is

591
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:22,159
also a project course where students

592
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:24,000
really um just learn by working on a a

593
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,000
analytics project with a company. So

594
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,159
they work with the company and the

595
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,760
company gives them you know a guide on

596
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,240
what they're expecting and the students

597
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,480
are ex you know doing the project and

598
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,720
getting a grade at the end of the

599
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,960
semester based on what they have done on

600
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,960
the project.

601
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,159
Thank you.

602
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,240
Um,

603
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,640
so there's lots of questions about GRE

604
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,440
and GMAT and so this is an optional

605
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,520
component when applying. Um, Michelle,

606
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,840
people were asking what is your

607
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,240
viewpoint on if applicants have taken

608
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,720
the exam? Um, should they still submit

609
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,840
scores?

610
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,520
Um yeah definitely if you took the exam

611
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,720
if you took all the trouble to take the

612
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,720
exam yeah go please submit the score

613
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,440
because I mean if it's a good score if

614
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,360
it's a bad score then you know maybe try

615
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,000
again but definitely if you took all the

616
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,880
effort to take the exam tell us how you

617
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,279
did um but it's not required we put a

618
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,520
lot of weight on your transcript. Um so

619
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,840
make sure your transcript looks good and

620
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:42,480
you have good grades on your transcript.

621
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,480
Um that's really the deciding factor.

622
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,960
>> Students asked if you know of any

623
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,679
favorite courses that students take um

624
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,120
that is related to business analytics.

625
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,440
>> Uh well you know that's a always fun

626
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,000
question. I I think you'd have to ask

627
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,559
the students what their favorite courses

628
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,039
are and in the past the best courses are

629
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,600
the courses taught by the best faculty.

630
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,760
So the question really is who's your

631
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,840
favorite professor? And I'm not really

632
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,000
able to say that later on a recorded

633
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,600
webinar, but there's, you know, more

634
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
favorite professors than other favorite

635
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,080
professors. It's just based on who you

636
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,399
like and who what kind of teaching style

637
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,840
you like. So you can go and see like who

638
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,000
are the high most highly rated

639
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,760
professors. And chances are whatever

640
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,360
course they're teaching is an amazing

641
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,440
course. Um, given all that said, um, one

642
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,520
of the favorite most favorite elective

643
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,279
courses our students have taken, no

644
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,880
matter who's teaching it, is power

645
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,600
negotiations.

646
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,200
It's a MBA course that's highly soughta

647
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,840
and our students can take it in the

648
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,360
spring. So, power negotiations will help

649
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,640
you with any future business deal or

650
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,919
even negotiating buying a car or, you

651
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,679
know, your salary or um, offers, all

652
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,120
that. So, a lot of our students love

653
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,120
that course, Power Negotiation.
