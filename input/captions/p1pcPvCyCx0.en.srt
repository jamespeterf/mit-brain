00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,720
so for a lot of people around the world

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,280
we're now using AI for a lot of our

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,280
projects and work and everything really

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,920
and in this case with climate change we

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,600
want to use the data that AI has and try

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,400
and make different solutions to this

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:23,439
ongoing problem in our world and we

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,920
learned that not all AI has credibility

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,960
and it can't be right all the time so

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,599
you really have to make sure to check

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,759
your credibility of your your sources

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,559
like you would with any other project

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,520
even though it might seem that AI always

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,120
has the right answer everyone is biased

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,920
and you could even argue that chat gbt

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,399
and AI is biased you really don't know

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,640
but our generation has to really work

19
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,680
with AI and get to know it better so we

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,039
can use it to the best of its ability

21
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:57,719
