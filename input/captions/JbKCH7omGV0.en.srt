1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,240
Today I have the privilege of

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,720
introducing our next speaker. Uh so this

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,800
is uh Garam Kim. She is a postdoc

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,200
post-dctoral fellow in Evan McCosco's

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,360
lab at the Broad Institute and a Leler

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,080
fellow at the Leler Center for the Study

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,520
of Neurodeenerative Diseases at Harvard.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,039
She previously completed her PhD in

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,279
neurosciences in Aaron Guilter's lab at

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,680
Stanford University. Her research

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,920
focuses on developing technologies that

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,239
combine highresolution imaging and high

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,640
throughput genomics tools in a spatially

14
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,559
resolved manner. She hopes to utilize

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,840
these spatial tools to interrogate the

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,399
biological underpinnings of

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,079
neurodeenerative diseases and to enable

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,840
people from diverse fields to study

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,320
their own research questions using these

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,000
tools as well. Today she's going to give

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,160
us a primer on spatial transcrytoics

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,520
technologies. Thank you.

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, she'll take questions anytime. And

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,000
um thank

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,280
you. Can everyone hear me? Okay. Okay.

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,040
Perfect. Um thank you all for being here

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,560
at this early and rainy hour and thank

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:18,479
you uh both to the organizers for um

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,119
inviting me to to uh share this primer

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,119
on spatial transcrytoics technologies.

31
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,360
Um, and as she just said, please feel

32
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,400
free to stop me at any point. I will do

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,200
my best to answer uh any questions that

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,200
you may

35
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,200
have.

36
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,200
So, okay. So, to give you an overview of

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,520
this primer, I'll first give you a brief

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,000
introduction on spatial transcrytoics,

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,560
what it is, key concepts, and why we

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,079
want to use these technologies. Then I'm

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,520
going to walk you through some examples

42
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,560
and how we can broadly classify these

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,799
technologies. And then we'll discuss

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,880
each method's strengths and challenges

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,240
associated with um these types of

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,439
technologies as well as some practical

47
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,520
considerations for what to look for when

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,079
you're choosing uh which tool you may

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,319
want to use for your particular study.

50
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,479
And lastly, we'll touch on some

51
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,080
immediate and medium-term future

52
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,280
directions um in the field of spatial

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,959
transcrytoics. Okay. So what is spatial

54
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,280
transcrytoics? Um I think that to

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,680
understand fully spatial transcrytoics

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,560
we first want to understand its most

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,560
famous predecessors in particular bulk

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,239
RNA sequencing and single cell RNA

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,959
sequencing.

60
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,959
Um, so this is a cross-section of a

61
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,120
human brain. And as you can see, there

62
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,000
are many Lego pieces that define

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,680
different uh distinct brain regions and

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,879
perhaps even um distinct structures at

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,840
the micro level. And where what what

66
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:54,000
bulk RNA sequencing looks like is like

67
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,800
this. So, um, when we sample any piece

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,400
of tissue from this human brain, uh,

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,319
basically we grind up all the RNAs in a

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
way that's kind of indistinct and

71
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,879
disorganized because now it's kind of in

72
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,720
a in a soup of Lego blocks. And um, this

73
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,800
is advantageous in a way because it's

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,959
very high sensitivity. You're just

75
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,200
grinding up the RNAs and sequencing all

76
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,560
the transcripts that are there. However,

77
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,959
you're losing a lot of information

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,040
because you're averaging um all the gene

79
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,000
expression across a sample. So, you you

80
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,840
can't tell with a RNA transcript came

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,400
from this Lego block versus a different

82
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,319
Lego block. Okay. Then, uh the next I

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,840
guess big

84
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,440
um uh technological advancement was the

85
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,560
development of single cell RNA

86
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,400
sequencing. And so what this enabled was

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:50,159
that now we could look at individual

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,400
cell types and cell states. Um but uh so

89
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,120
yeah so now you can see that the Lego

90
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,200
blocks are kind of uh you know separated

91
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,280
out in space. It can be grouped and you

92
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,920
can kind of see what structures they

93
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,319
came from. Um but one thing that you

94
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,000
still lose is actually its context and

95
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,319
where it was in space. And this is

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,959
because in order to get these single

97
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,680
cell or single nuclear suspensions you

98
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,079
have to dissociate the

99
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,959
tissue. Um so then finally this brings

100
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,400
us to the advent of spatial

101
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,400
transcrytoics which preserves tissue

102
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,280
structures and it allows you to kind of

103
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,919
see okay uh what what did all of my

104
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,160
neighbors look like and what are the

105
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,680
kind of cell interactions and micro

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,680
environment that surrounds that

107
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,680
particular

108
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,120
cell. Okay. So why would we want to why

109
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,080
do we care about studying gene

110
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,240
expression in space? Well, first, ooh,

111
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,080
this is very small, but this is an

112
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,320
example of a very earlier um plot from

113
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,160
one of the earlier spatial technologies.

114
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,759
And what this is is it's um a um plot is

115
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,080
a top type of plot that you get in

116
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,840
single cell RNA sequencing where every

117
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,000
dot represents a unique cell or nucleus.

118
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,040
This dimensionality reduction allows us

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,280
to see that cells that are closer to

120
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,440
each other in their transcripttoic

121
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,240
profile will tend to be also closer

122
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,639
together in space. And so based on this

123
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,720
unbiased hierarchical clustering, we see

124
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,960
that there are distinct cell types that

125
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,440
are per perhaps associated with um

126
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:26,080
distinct regions. Now, um the moment you

127
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,000
put this into space, what you can see

128
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,560
and begin to appreciate is that across

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,639
these different tissue types, um you now

130
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,320
start to see rather than just random

131
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,919
dots in space that kind of cluster

132
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,240
together. Now, um they are you can now

133
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,919
start to see where they lie in space and

134
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,320
what its neighbors look like. And you

135
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,240
can even see the these uh appendimal

136
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,680
cell layer for instance it's a single

137
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,639
cell layer um right near the hippocampus

138
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,280
in the mouse

139
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,759
hippocampus. So basically studying gene

140
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,919
expression in space allows us to see

141
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,320
what cells is it interacting with? What

142
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,000
does the tissue architecture look like?

143
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,080
Um if there's a disease micro

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,400
environment uh is there any kind of

145
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,000
inflammatory niche? Is there some kind

146
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,479
of cell population that's going to um I

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,400
guess aggregate together? And we can

148
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,000
start to see the spatial patterning that

149
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,000
tells us a lot more about what's

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,600
happening

151
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,919
biologically. Okay. Um so in addition to

152
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,560
these sequencing based technologies, I

153
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,800
thought it would be nice to uh look at

154
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,360
how we came to the state of the spatial

155
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,039
genomics field as we know it to today.

156
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,240
And you know there are many historic

157
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,479
milestones and um so many technologies

158
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,720
that have been developed over decades.

159
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:47,199
But um the way that I have tried to kind

160
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,199
of condense it is uh I guess to the

161
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,800
particular experiments or developments

162
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,639
that really paved the way for modern uh

163
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,759
the the modern technologies that we know

164
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,599
today. So starting in 1969 is actually

165
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,280
when we saw the first ever INC2

166
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,000
hybridization.

167
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,880
So this was the first technique in C2,

168
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,599
so in place in the tissue without having

169
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,440
to isolate anything um that they were

170
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:16,720
able to use radioactive probes that uh

171
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,199
would label a very specific DNA sequence

172
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,520
and so you can see it labeling in little

173
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,520
dots um inside the nucleus and this

174
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,840
established the principle that you can

175
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,680
actually detect nucleic acids in a

176
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,800
native context. Um, another year and I

177
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,440
guess technology that I chose was 1996,

178
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,599
the invention of laser capture micro

179
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,960
dissection. And the idea was that you

180
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:44,400
could use a laser to basically cut very

181
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,800
focal fields of view inside a tissue and

182
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,039
transfer it onto this film and then you

183
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,000
would be able to do whatever downstream

184
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,639
analysis you wanted to do. So at this

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,400
point what what this shows is that

186
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,199
you're able to kind of preserve some

187
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,400
level of spatial information and this is

188
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,800
a big step towards um spatial precision.

189
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,720
And in this case this isn't a specific

190
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,800
cell this is actually beta amaloid

191
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,280
plaques um that's associated with

192
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,520
Alzheimer

193
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:18,319
disease. Then uh in oh okay so actually

194
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,360
I I flipped the order of those so please

195
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,560
forgive me. Um so the other I guess

196
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,639
major development was not just incitu

197
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
hybridization using radioactive probes

198
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,720
but now using fluoresence in situ

199
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,200
hybridization which introduced this idea

200
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,640
that now you can have multiplex spatial

201
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,479
uh transcrytoics. So you can now

202
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,680
visualize more than one type of

203
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,839
transcript at one at a given time. Um

204
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,599
and finally this brings us to modern day

205
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,080
spatial transcrytoics that we know

206
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,160
today. So higher throughput um

207
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,560
technologies that now allow us to

208
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,760
visualize many many transcripts inside

209
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,680
of cells uh using very clever strategies

210
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,519
or uh I guess in this context this is a

211
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,680
single cell with many transcripts

212
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,160
labeled inside uh in the case of the

213
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,399
right image this is one of those plots

214
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,720
that I described earlier but now plotted

215
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,920
out in space and we can see that from a

216
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,279
single experiment uh that that all these

217
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,560
different cell types are able to be

218
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,440
resolved.

219
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,040
Okay. So, what are the types of spatial

220
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,200
technologies if we're going to broadly

221
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,120
classify it? So, this is not going to be

222
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,800
a comprehensive list because there are

223
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,839
way too many technologies, but I'm going

224
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,160
to highlight a few especially um a few

225
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,720
that are commercially available or uh

226
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,800
perhaps were invented at the the broad.

227
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,279
Okay. So, uh again, there could be many

228
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,839
ways you could classify it. Um I think

229
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,279
one way that I decided to classify it is

230
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,240
into two broad ca categories of um

231
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,560
spatial technologies. So one of them is

232
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,440
imaging based uh spatial technologies

233
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,760
and the other is sequencing

234
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:59,440
based. So in imaging based methods um

235
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,680
the RNA is always detected through u

236
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,240
repeated cycles of fluorescent imaging.

237
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,320
So you would have some kind of targeted

238
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,399
probes that target a sequence that

239
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,360
you're interested in. um you would

240
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,959
fluorescently label it and you know

241
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,120
there's a limited number of channels

242
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,440
that you can image from at one time on a

243
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,000
microscope. So people have figured out

244
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,600
pretty clever ways to to really scale

245
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,160
this up so that you can um target you

246
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,000
know around 10,000 species at a time

247
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,360
even though most people choose not to

248
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,600
but that is definitely possible. Um and

249
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,440
one really nice thing about having this

250
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,279
imagebased readout is that you have

251
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,240
really high resolution. you see every

252
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,920
molecule. So it's very very uh uh like

253
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,079
you can see subcellular structures, you

254
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,079
can see the cell morphology uh and

255
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,399
things like that. Sequencing based

256
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,640
methods are different in that uh you

257
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,160
never actually look at the image of

258
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,079
um your tissue. I mean you could you

259
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,079
could acquire that but the actual

260
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,120
readout of the RNA itself is that the

261
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,600
RNA is captured basically off the tissue

262
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,800
or or through tissue dissociation and

263
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,519
then sequenced. And um in this case you

264
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,200
don't require um designing specific

265
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,200
probes to target transcripts of

266
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,600
interest. So you have a non-targeted

267
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,480
capture method and this actually enables

268
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,920
whole transcriptto wide profiling. Um in

269
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,760
terms of the resolution that is

270
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,839
dependent on technology and we'll get

271
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,320
into the different types of technologies

272
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:32,480
that are available. Okay. So by oh thank

273
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,720
you. Okay. So in terms of subasses

274
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,959
uh so you know these are two very broad

275
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,839
categories but I thought I would divide

276
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,160
them further into a couple subasses. So

277
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,640
for imaging based technologies there's a

278
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,279
fluoresence in C2 hybridization that I

279
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,360
mentioned earlier as well as in C2

280
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,680
sequencing and I'm going to go into what

281
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,240
what those both mean uh in greater

282
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,240
detail. And in terms of sequencing

283
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,079
based, perhaps we could divide it into

284
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,360
things that uh technologies that use a

285
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:03,680
spot-based. So some kind of barcoded

286
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,480
array that already has um defined

287
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,200
spatial positions with spatial barcodes.

288
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,079
Uh and then that captures the RNA from

289
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,600
the tissue or a cell base where you are

290
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,560
actually tagging the cells with the

291
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:21,440
spatial information and then um using

292
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:24,399
that to put it back into space. Okay. So

293
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,200
let's now go into examples of uh imaging

294
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,360
based spatial technologies. Um these are

295
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,880
just a few that I'm going to

296
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,120
mention.

297
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Um but first I guess for any imaging

298
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,959
based spatial technology if you look at

299
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,399
the key principles

300
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:44,240
um there's basically three major steps.

301
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,560
So the first step is that you're

302
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,639
generating some kind of optical barcode.

303
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,920
So some kind of barcode that you can use

304
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,360
to identify the particular RNA trans

305
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,279
transcript of interest and that barcode

306
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,000
um is different across the technologies

307
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,160
and I'm about to get into that um but

308
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,639
generally you'll have some kind of probe

309
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,279
that's binding to a target of interest

310
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,279
and then um I guess you're generating

311
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,680
fluorescent signal in different ways

312
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,480
across different technologies and then

313
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,560
you read out this signal via single or

314
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,720
multiolor fluoresence.

315
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,440
And then uh once you have that

316
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,920
fluorescent signal then you would image

317
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,160
and then get rid of that signal and then

318
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,720
do another round of imaging. So you have

319
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,800
this constant um cycle of sequential

320
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,279
imaging followed by signal removal. And

321
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,079
you do this as many times as necessary

322
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,399
for your particular set of transcripts

323
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,399
that you're probing for. Um, and

324
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,800
finally, once you have acquired those

325
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,600
series of images, then you're going to

326
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,200
have to um use the actual images

327
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,560
themselves to figure out which

328
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,880
fluorescent spots um you know uh

329
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,120
correlated with which transcripts over

330
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,199
over the rounds of imaging. And so this

331
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,480
is how you're going to then identify

332
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:07,680
what was the actual identity of that RNA

333
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:11,760
transcript. Okay. So uh two of the I

334
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,680
guess um two of two very commonly used

335
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,800
fluorescent and sichu hybridization

336
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,440
methods fish methods are called murfish

337
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,959
and seekfish. So murfish stands for

338
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,079
multipplexed error resistant fish rolls

339
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,720
right off the tongue. Um and seekfish is

340
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,920
sequential fish. So I think that kind of

341
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,760
um is self-explanatory.

342
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,680
So uh I mentioned that for each of these

343
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,959
um technologies that they have a

344
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,560
different way of generating the optical

345
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:44,959
barcode. In the case of Murfish it's a

346
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,279
binary code. So which means every

347
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,000
transcript is actually just given a

348
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,360
random um and unique series of zeros and

349
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,839
ones. So so you will never have two

350
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,079
overlapping series of zeros and ones.

351
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:03,120
Um, so let's assume like transcript one

352
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:05,839
has like the sequence 11 one zero and

353
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,279
RNA 2 a different transcript has the

354
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,760
sequence one 01. Um that would mean that

355
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,880
for the first round of imaging you would

356
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,000
have probes that target these two

357
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:20,160
transcripts and in the next round of

358
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,040
imaging you would be missing um a a a

359
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,519
fluorescent readout for the a molecule

360
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,440
that's binding that particular

361
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,760
transcript. Sequential fish is actually

362
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,760
a very similar idea except that instead

363
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,240
of a binary code now you have a color

364
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,519
code.

365
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:40,480
Um so how does this look? So, uh, this

366
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,240
is a cell if you couldn't tell. And here

367
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,839
are five different transcripts that are

368
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,800
being, um, imaged in this round. And so,

369
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,560
this is just at the first base position.

370
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,440
Now, we're going to image and figure out

371
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,279
which uh, fluorescent spots had a one,

372
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,040
so there was signal. And in the next

373
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,199
round, perhaps um, this transcript now

374
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,360
had a zero in that spot. And so you're

375
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,399
imaging the same spot over all of these

376
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,199
rounds of imaging until finally uh once

377
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,519
you acquire all of the images, you

378
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,959
figure out what was this string of ones

379
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,600
and zeros at that particular um place.

380
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,440
And then you can decode it to basically

381
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,959
figure out what was the identity of that

382
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,519
transcript. And then again sequential

383
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,279
fish is kind of similar in idea except

384
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,440
that this time um they were given

385
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,000
different colors instead of a binary

386
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,000
ones and

387
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,279
zeros. Okay. And then what about the

388
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,920
other kind of subcl broader subclass

389
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,880
under imaging based um spatial

390
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,880
transcrytoics methods is uh it's called

391
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:50,399
INC2 sequencing. So uh two of these

392
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,480
methods are one's called INC2 sequencing

393
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,880
and the other one uh and you might know

394
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,680
that one uh better as Zenium uh from 10X

395
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,720
and uh the other one this was developed

396
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,000
by a faculty member also at the abroad

397
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,000
uh Shaw Wong is called star map another

398
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,400
one that rolls right off the tongue

399
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,520
called spatially resolved transcript

400
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,240
amplon readout

401
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:19,039
mapping. So uh so I mentioned that

402
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,760
merfish had a binary code and sequential

403
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,400
fish had a color code. In the case of

404
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,600
these instit in C2 sequencing based

405
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,720
methods they have a actual just a unique

406
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:34,160
nucleotide barcode. So a series of AC's,

407
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,880
T's and G's and

408
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:42,400
um what these this class of technologies

409
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:46,480
relies on is a uh is a technology called

410
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,440
I guess or type of circularizing of DNA

411
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,240
called padlock probe hybridization. So

412
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,360
you have a padlock probe is basically a

413
00:17:52,240 --> 00:18:00,600
single strand of DNA and you have these

414
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:03,200
um these sequences at the ends that are

415
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,000
complmentary and completely next to each

416
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,400
other on uh that's targeting a

417
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,440
particular strand of interest and then

418
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,760
once it binds and it'll circularize then

419
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,520
you have a loation step to basically get

420
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,360
rid of that gap and now it's fully

421
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,919
circularized instead of just bound like

422
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,200
that. And then there's the other main

423
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,720
concept here is called rolling circle

424
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,440
amplification. And what that means is

425
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,480
that DNA polymerase will bind at a

426
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,640
priming site. Um and then it'll just

427
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,559
basically circle around and around and

428
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,039
around until it's just like super

429
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,520
amplifying itself. Um so in C2

430
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,160
sequencing and star map both use this

431
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,640
padlock probe plus uh rolling circle

432
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,559
amplification technology.

433
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,039
Um and so I guess you know yeah so

434
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,200
there's going to be some some reverse

435
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,160
transcription at some point and the way

436
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,360
that that is done differs um there are

437
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,520
different nuance uh I guess approaches

438
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,039
between the two technologies but the

439
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:08,240
basic idea of padlock probes and RCA um

440
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,240
is is there and then finally how do you

441
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,200
actually read out the unique sequences

442
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,760
that those probes bound to so there's

443
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,120
going to be some uh sequencing by

444
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,919
loation. So basically if these barcodes

445
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,360
are four to seven nucleotides long then

446
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,640
there's going to be some kind of

447
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,840
sequencing primer then a liation of a

448
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,280
fluoresence uh based nucleotide that's

449
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,200
going to read out what was that

450
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,039
nucleotide at that position. So it is

451
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,080
truly like you're actually sequencing

452
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:42,039
out um the actual sequence unlike

453
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:44,960
murfish and uh seekfish.

454
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:47,520
Okay. Okay. Finally, I guess the last

455
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,640
NC2 sequencing method that I thought I

456
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,919
would talk about is called expansion

457
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:56,080
sequencing. And for those of you who are

458
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,640
not familiar, um expansion microscopy is

459
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,679
a very cool technology. So, you know,

460
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,360
not everything, you know, is uh

461
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,080
resolvable in space with high

462
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,480
definition. So if you have something

463
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,440
very small and you have a microscope

464
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,520
that that doesn't reach that resolution,

465
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,679
how do you fix that problem without just

466
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,799
making a fancier microscope? Is that

467
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,559
actually instead of making the

468
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,960
microscope zoom in more, you can

469
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,880
actually just make the sample expand so

470
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,039
it's artificially bigger. And the way

471
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,200
that they do this is by embedding the

472
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:30,559
tissue inside of a hydro and then adding

473
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,320
water and it'll literally expand. So, so

474
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,280
what you're seeing here is that there

475
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,760
are some cells and now um they've

476
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,159
embedded it inside this gel and now it's

477
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,440
expanded and then now you can do NC2

478
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,559
sequencing as you would have done

479
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,559
otherwise. Um the other thing that was

480
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:51,840
uh in this um expansion sequencing paper

481
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,760
is that uh you could also do XC2

482
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,840
sequencing. So basically after you've

483
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,320
sequenced it in C2 if you wanted to have

484
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:03,120
an additional quality control you could

485
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:06,240
um basically isolate out um the rollies

486
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,760
that you created it uh in C2 and then

487
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,840
sequence it out you know

488
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,880
externally. Okay. Yeah. So basically the

489
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,240
three key steps are expansion in C2

490
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,840
sequencing and then optionally XC2

491
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:24,080
sequencing. That brings us to sequencing

492
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:28,080
based spatial technologies. So um there

493
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,480
are also a lot of them. I won't uh talk

494
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,000
about every single one but uh that's

495
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,159
just some listed. Um and again the key

496
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,880
principles that are shared across all

497
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,600
capture and sequencing based

498
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,280
technologies. Um, in terms of

499
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,520
capturebased technologies, the idea is

500
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,000
that you have some kind of capture array

501
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,919
that has some kind of spots that could

502
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,960
be like literal spots, it could be

503
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:56,320
beats, it could be some kind of cluster.

504
00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:01,280
Um, but each spot has a unique set of

505
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:04,159
spatially barcoded DNAs. And these um,

506
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,720
barcodes have a unique spatial barcode

507
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,960
per one of those spots. It has a unique

508
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,880
molecular identifier. So if you have

509
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,200
multiple molecules that share the same

510
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,840
spatial barcode that can be captured and

511
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,200
then it has a polyDT at the end. So

512
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,039
that'll allow us to capture all

513
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:26,360
polyadenolated mRNAs in a very unbiased

514
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:29,840
manner uh or unargeted manner. Um, and

515
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,000
then yeah, so and then I guess so the

516
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,039
key principles in addition to the use of

517
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,400
a capture array is that you you're going

518
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:40,640
to place a piece of tissue. Uh, it could

519
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,600
be fixed or frozen and then you place it

520
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,520
directly on top of the barcoded capture

521
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,760
array. Um, then you would actually

522
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,000
capture the RNA. So perhaps the RNA will

523
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,679
diffuse onto the array and bind to the

524
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,240
spatial barcodes or the other way

525
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,520
around. Then you're going to prepare

526
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,720
remove the tissue and prepare um I guess

527
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,200
you know you'll have some kind of

528
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,120
reverse transcription to get cDNA then

529
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,039
you'll prepare the libraries for

530
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,400
sequencing and then you'll actually

531
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:11,360
sequence it out. Um so that's the basic

532
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,080
principles. So now going into examples

533
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,840
of major capture and sequencing based

534
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,799
methods is uh I guess I put these three

535
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,600
on the same slide cuz I guess uh you can

536
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:26,480
kind of see side by side how they're

537
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:30,000
quite similar but the ways in which they

538
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,280
differ. So 10x Genomics has a product

539
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,480
called Bizium. Um the difference so

540
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,720
basically the original version has a a

541
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:44,559
glass slide that has this kind of uh

542
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:47,280
barcodes at at uh a resolution where you

543
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:50,640
know the beads are about 100 microns

544
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:53,200
apart center to center. And so you can

545
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,919
imagine that's actually on the lower

546
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,159
side of resolution now in retrospect uh

547
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,799
because it's not single cell resolution.

548
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,520
Single cells are much smaller than that.

549
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:08,000
Um however since then there's been

550
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:11,600
Vizium 2 which has been um adaptable for

551
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,159
uh fixed tissues and Vizm HD is the

552
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,960
latest version that now gets actually

553
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,919
down to two micron resolution and they

554
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,520
use um squares that don't have any

555
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,559
spacing in between. So it's supposed to

556
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,440
be a lot higher resolution

557
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,640
um and it's compatible with formal infix

558
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,799
paraffin embedded or FFP tissues. So

559
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,640
actually tissue fixation is another

560
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,279
topic that we'll come back to in a

561
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,320
little bit. Um then there's this

562
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:43,919
highdefinition spatial transcrytoics so

563
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,840
called high definition ST. So ST which

564
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,400
was the version before this is actually

565
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,520
I think the first spatial tech like high

566
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,000
throughput spatial technology. Um but

567
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,320
the idea here is that you have um these

568
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,600
wells and each of these wells has a

569
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,000
single bead and each of the beads has a

570
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,320
unique spatial barcode and so this bead

571
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,400
is about two microns in size. So that's

572
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,440
that's where the high definition came

573
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,799
from. And then slideseek is a technology

574
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,520
that was developed in in uh my lab which

575
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,600
is uh Evan McCosco's lab in

576
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,159
collaboration with fa hen's lab also at

577
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:27,919
the broad and the way that uh these

578
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:31,919
capture arrays are created is that uh we

579
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:34,000
have a bunch of 10 micron beads that are

580
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:38,080
uh that we can basically spin down onto

581
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,600
glass slides and or a glass surface and

582
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,960
it'll just be randomly situated and we

583
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,799
will uh sequence those so that we have a

584
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,279
ground truth of where the spatial

585
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,200
barcodes are at each of those locations.

586
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,159
Then we place a tissue on there allow

587
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:58,159
the RNAs from the tissue to diffuse and

588
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:03,120
bind onto um the the these uh bead

589
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:04,720
capture uh the polyDTS here and then uh

590
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,960
and then we'll do the downstream

591
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,360
processing to to get the libraries

592
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,520
prepared and

593
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,760
sequenced. Okay. And then um this

594
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,720
another technology that also rolls off

595
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,559
the tongue is called dit dbit seek. So

596
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,400
this is a little bit different from the

597
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,799
capture based arrays that we just spoke

598
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,279
talked about. So DBS seek stands for

599
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:29,919
deterministic barcoding and tissue for

600
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:33,520
spatial omix sequencing. Um and uh and

601
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,919
instead of bead or wells this actually

602
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,960
uh or having this kind of array this is

603
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,919
actually a micrflu

604
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:44,640
micrluidics based method. So basically

605
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:48,000
you have micrfluidics chips that have uh

606
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,400
parallel lanes throughout and you clamp

607
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,120
this microffluidic chip directly onto

608
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,799
the tissue and then into the

609
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,159
micrfluidics wells you're going to

610
00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:01,360
introduce uh

611
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:03,200
polydagged DNA barcodes um inside those

612
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,039
channels and let it just flow over the

613
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,600
tissue. Then you're going to uh add a

614
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,480
second I guess perpendicular um

615
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,039
micrfluidic chip on top. And then and

616
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,279
then uh what you put into that is a

617
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,919
biotinilated second barcode that's going

618
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:24,360
to have your unique molecule uh

619
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:27,279
molecular identifier information.

620
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,120
Um and it's biasilated so that

621
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:33,200
downstream you it can bind to strep

622
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:35,520
tavitin beads and um be used during uh

623
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,120
library preparation and generation. Can

624
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,159
I ask you a quick question about that?

625
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,880
Are they are there plans to make this

626
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,520
three-dimensional so that you get the

627
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,400
xyz position of these barcodes? So I

628
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,840
think that is a common goal across all

629
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:53,200
the technologies. Um, star map is the

630
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,159
only one from the among the technologies

631
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,039
I've discussed where in their initial

632
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,760
study they they kind of presented it as

633
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,799
a 3D method. One thing I didn't mention

634
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,799
is that star map um has hydrogel

635
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,840
embedding as well and they do very mild

636
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:13,200
expansion and also tissue clearing to to

637
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,840
kind of help with the imaging. Um in the

638
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,720
case of debt seek I don't believe that

639
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,399
is uh it's there yet but I think all

640
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,399
technology at the end of the day are

641
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,600
striving to get there at some point.

642
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:29,679
Yeah thank you for that

643
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:32,200
question. Okay. Um so now getting to

644
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,039
higher resolution this is called

645
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:39,679
stereosseek so spatial enhanced

646
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:44,880
resolution omix sequencing. And um what

647
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:48,960
this type of array uh uses is called DNA

648
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,720
nanobballs um which is DNB. So basically

649
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,799
what you do is you have single stranded

650
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,200
DNAs and you also use rolling circle

651
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,760
amplification to just make like a bunch

652
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,840
of copies of itself and and then because

653
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,960
DNA is very negatively charged it'll

654
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,720
just kind of like spontaneously like go

655
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,600
into like this ball which is why they

656
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,000
have um all of these balls and then they

657
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,200
have a pattern chip and basically they

658
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,559
they'll flow over these this DNA nanob

659
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,440
balls across all of the uh uh the the

660
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:25,919
flow cell. And because these nanobballs

661
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:29,039
are about 200 nanometers um in size,

662
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:34,080
it'll naturally kind of only occupy one

663
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:37,039
per uh patterned spot. Um and then uh

664
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,559
and then that's actually used to capture

665
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:43,279
the RNA. And then um again, similar

666
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:46,159
principle downstream, but that that's

667
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:49,200
primarily the difference um with other

668
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:52,000
technologies. And I believe this is the

669
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,799
last capture based method that I'm going

670
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,559
to mention. It's called open ST. It's

671
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,720
open because like everything their

672
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,240
scripts and uh their methods and

673
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,559
everything is very open. They want

674
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,960
everyone to use it as open- source

675
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:07,840
technology. But they had a very clever

676
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,960
idea of taking the aluminum flow cells

677
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,640
which have very very high resolution uh

678
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,640
and it's very tightly packed and they

679
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,760
took advantage of their sequencing by

680
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,720
synthesis method to basically within the

681
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,440
flow cell um generate unique spatial

682
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:25,760
barcodes there and then and then they

683
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,799
would do um some kind of post-processing

684
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:32,080
to to make it

685
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:34,559
um amendable to RNA capture and you can

686
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,200
basically break up They have like a you

687
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,320
can cut these flow cells. They have a

688
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,919
cutting

689
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:45,279
like you know like some technology that

690
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:48,080
they say you can also do. Um and then

691
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,159
basically in terms of the size that

692
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,480
you're able to spatially profile is

693
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,799
going to be limited to the size of these

694
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,960
flow cells. So you can see actually in

695
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,120
length it's actually quite good. I think

696
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,880
it's I forget exactly how many

697
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,880
centimeters maybe like nine or 10

698
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,799
centimeters or something like that but

699
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,360
in width it's you know small small so um

700
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,480
but I think this a really exciting idea

701
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,880
and again you're going to have the RNAs

702
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:20,240
bind to that flow cell and

703
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:23,440
um yeah and and you're able to then get

704
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,159
very high resolution information. So

705
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,000
that was all spot-based. But the second

706
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,559
subclass I mentioned and I'm actually

707
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,200
only going to give one example and um

708
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:37,679
this is the technology that is most dear

709
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:40,320
to my heart because my postto project uh

710
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,320
is built off of this technology. So if

711
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,519
you have any specific questions, let me

712
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,240
know. Um uh so what I mean by cellbased

713
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,600
is that instead of capturing RNAs onto

714
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,279
an array, we're actually now um tagging

715
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,559
the cells with the spatial

716
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:59,679
information. And this method is called

717
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,480
slide tags. And so slide tags actually

718
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,799
still uses a beat array as well. And

719
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,760
they also have spatial barcodes. The

720
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:10,000
difference is that um now it has a photo

721
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,600
cleavable linker so that when you shine

722
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,080
UV light on it um the spatial barcodes

723
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,360
will cleave off of the p uh the of the

724
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,440
bead array and tag the tissue. And so

725
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,760
you just have an intact piece of tissue

726
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,159
and once the nuclei attacks then you can

727
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,480
actually isolate the nuclei and then you

728
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,279
can use any established single cell

729
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,159
profiling technology beyond even um just

730
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,440
the transcripttoone to profile these

731
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:40,200
nuclei in a very high throughput

732
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:44,799
fashion. So it it it basically um I

733
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:48,399
guess will I what's the word tag tag

734
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:51,039
tail tail anyway? it it'll it'll um

735
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,039
blend in to existing workloads very

736
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,200
easily because all you're doing is just

737
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,559
adding a tag of DNA barcodes and then

738
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,640
you just remove the the array. Um so

739
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,720
then I guess the advantage of this is

740
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,480
that now you have the very high

741
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,120
throughput capture um unargeted capture

742
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:14,320
of RNAs. So you can still get this high

743
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:16,399
resolution um um and then um and then at

744
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,279
this point using the spatial barcodes

745
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:24,120
that was uh that each nucleus is tagged

746
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:27,679
with you can now map it back into space

747
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:30,320
um uh depending on what what were the

748
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,039
spatial barcodes and in what quantities

749
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,919
it was tagged

750
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:38,159
with. So now when we're um actually

751
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,799
comparing all of these spatial methods,

752
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,200
you can see that the resolution uh the

753
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,600
spatial resolution across these

754
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,480
technologies differs. This is this

755
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,640
figure is taken from a review in um that

756
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,640
was published in 2022. So it's

757
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,960
definitely missing some of the very big

758
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,799
technologies, but you can see that even

759
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:03,679
at that time um we were you know seeing

760
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,679
0.25 25 micron resolutions.

761
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:11,839
Um yeah and but you know

762
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,720
uh one thing I wanted to mention is that

763
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:17,520
so far we have talked about spatial

764
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,839
resolution and like you know how small

765
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,040
are these spots that we can actually tag

766
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:24,440
tag the cells with but actually um at

767
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,599
the end of the

768
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,919
day that's a spatial resolution but what

769
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,839
we haven't really discussed is the RNA

770
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:36,639
resolution And

771
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:38,560
um and at least on the RNA end at the

772
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,800
end of the day, single cell sequencing

773
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,399
remains kind of the gold standard for

774
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,200
unbiased transcripttoics. It's very

775
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:46,639
reproducible. It's commercially

776
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,240
available. There's a massive

777
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,760
computational toolbox. Um it it covers

778
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,480
genomewide

779
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,280
uh transcripts and there's also

780
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,880
established multi modality in terms of

781
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,119
um what other information you can

782
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,240
capture. Especially I think one of the

783
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:08,800
most common ones is the RNA and the taxi

784
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:12,640
multiome and and uh one way to really

785
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:16,320
drive this home is a direct comparison

786
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,000
of the RNA profiles and UMAPs across uh

787
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,000
four different technologies. Three of

788
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,079
them capture based and one of them um

789
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,240
cellbased. And so you can see that uh

790
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,880
again I mentioned at the beginning that

791
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,320
in when you have this dimensionality

792
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,119
reduction um cells that are closer to

793
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,520
each other in uh in in their gene

794
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,880
expression profile will also be closer

795
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:43,359
to each other in um space. Uh and the

796
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,839
more clearly that they isolate from each

797
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:50,400
other um I guess the more distinct they

798
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:53,720
are. And when you also look at you know

799
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,000
various um cell types and gene

800
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:59,200
expression you can see for instance in

801
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,200
the senium data set that uh when you

802
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,320
look at a excitatory neuron marker

803
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,079
across all the clusters that perhaps

804
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,720
it's it's looking like like it's

805
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,720
expressed in a lot of clusters. Um, and

806
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,440
part of that is that actually the spot,

807
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,640
no matter how big or small, you can have

808
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,480
nanocale resolution in a spot, but you

809
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,040
still have to actually map it back to

810
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,359
the cells. So, it's actually a very

811
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,079
tricky computational problem to try to

812
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,000
deconvolute um what the signal from each

813
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,280
of those spots and which cell it came

814
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,160
from. Um, so that that's just another

815
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,040
thing to keep in mind um as as we

816
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,960
consider these technologies.

817
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,320
So now we'll briefly touch on the

818
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,520
strengths and challenges of each of

819
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,599
these methods and hopefully have a a

820
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,720
practical how to really choose the

821
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,880
platform that's that's for you. So the

822
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,480
strength and challenges of imaging based

823
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,440
methods

824
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,040
um as as you saw you can really directly

825
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,440
visualize every single fluoresence

826
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,920
molecule and so that subscellular

827
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,280
resolution is really nice like it's I

828
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,960
think there's something very beautiful

829
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,800
about being able to see the morphology

830
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,680
and the cell structure and and

831
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,760
everything around it. Um, so you get the

832
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,400
morphological context. You can also

833
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,520
co-detect it with protein. Um, and you

834
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,119
don't have any kind of tissue

835
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,000
dissociation artifacts because you're

836
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,560
looking at the tissue as

837
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,720
is. However, um, in terms of, uh,

838
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,880
potential challenges is that that

839
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,359
requires very specialized microscopy

840
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,280
equipment. Um, you will be limited to

841
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,079
targeted gene panels because you have to

842
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,440
always design the probe. um you do have

843
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,839
a kind of molecular crowding situation

844
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,760
where you you know if you have too many

845
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,440
molecules together in space and you have

846
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,720
florores that are bleeding into each

847
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,240
other um that that might pose a small

848
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,240
challenge

849
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,440
um with expansion I think it's a little

850
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,800
bit more resolvable but nonetheless that

851
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,960
can be a challenge um imaging based

852
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,720
methods also will pick up all

853
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,720
fluorescent signals and that's not

854
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,240
limited to specific fluorescent signals

855
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,560
It will also pick up background

856
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,320
fluoresence and particularly in human

857
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,839
tissues there's gross amounts of

858
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,480
autofllororesence that come from

859
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:15,040
lipopusin buildup over time. So that is

860
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,200
also another challenge to keep in mind

861
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,200
given that um there's this uh probe

862
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:24,000
hybridization stripping u and rounds of

863
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:27,119
imaging uh these protocols can be very

864
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,599
complex and uh require very long imaging

865
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,160
times and that can also sometimes lead

866
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,240
to photobleaching and light toxicity. So

867
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,760
that's also, you know, dependent on how

868
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,520
many rounds of imaging, what does your

869
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,760
panel look like, how many transcripts

870
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,560
are you trying to probe, but that is a

871
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,520
uh potential challenge. And uh with each

872
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,000
of these probe designs, you need it you

873
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,440
need it to actually be all at the same

874
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,200
time. You need to be very highly

875
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,760
specific. You don't want it to cross

876
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,920
react because they are kind of short um

877
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,000
oligo sequences that are, you know,

878
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,520
binding to your transcripts of interest.

879
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,599
So you want to make sure that it's not

880
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,640
going to have offtarget effects and bind

881
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,320
to other similar transcripts. Um so

882
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,079
that's what we mean by minimal cross

883
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,320
reactivity. And then you want to make

884
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,400
sure that the hybridization efficacy is

885
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,280
pretty uniform across all the

886
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,079
transcripts. You don't want one um probe

887
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,720
that's going to bind much strongly much

888
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,720
stronger than another transcript. And

889
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,480
finally, you know, to follow every

890
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:28,960
single one of those dots and and um

891
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,400
figure out keep track of their identity,

892
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,520
it can be very computationally

893
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,320
intensive. I may have missed this. Uh

894
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:38,880
did you are all the methods um poly t

895
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,119
RNAs or can you capture non um

896
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,440
polytarnas? Uh you can.

897
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:48,280
So, so one of the uh technologies that I

898
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:54,160
use is actually

899
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:56,480
um well, so 10X has this flex kit that

900
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,359
has probe based capture, but it captures

901
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,200
a whole transcripttome and depending you

902
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,680
can just basically change out the handle

903
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,920
so that um it's binding to whatever

904
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,200
transcript of interest. I think poly

905
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,880
RNAs are easy cuz they're all regardless

906
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,599
of transcript identity, they all have

907
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,960
A's. Um, but I think there are ways to

908
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:19,599
enrich or deplete for specific uh types

909
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,160
of RNAs or sequences that you might be

910
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,960
interested in. But, um, I think most of

911
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,960
the technologies start from the poly

912
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,400
RNAs because it's kind of low hanging

913
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:35,079
fruit. Um you know if you use random

914
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:38,720
primers you can capture other RNAs.

915
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:41,839
Um you can also you know add a poly

916
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:46,000
adenolation step which is uh something

917
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:49,359
that a later version of debit seek

918
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,440
called pathodit does and um other

919
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,599
technologies have done that not

920
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,880
necessarily just in the spatial context

921
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:59,440
but just in single cell context. Um so

922
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,640
there there are ways to to capture other

923
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,400
RNAs as

924
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:07,280
well. Okay. And then in terms of the

925
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,000
sequencing based methods well I just

926
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,760
mentioned oh so so even the probe based

927
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,440
method it's still covers the whole

928
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,720
transcriptto. So the throughput is the

929
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,920
same but I guess uh yeah so in that

930
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,880
particular uh case it's using probes but

931
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,319
it's whole transcriptto. Yeah. And it

932
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,079
doesn't add more time to have whole

933
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,240
transcription. Okay. And then the

934
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,240
strengths and weak uh not weaknesses

935
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,200
challenges of these capture and

936
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,920
sequencing based methods is again um

937
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,319
when it's sequenced it can be unargeted

938
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,319
and cover the whole transcriptto in a

939
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,560
very high throughput manner. Uh it's

940
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,200
compatible with existing next generation

941
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,040
sequencing workflows uh and a lot of

942
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,440
more standardized workflows that maybe

943
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,359
people are more broad like widely

944
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,520
familiar with. So it requires less

945
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,520
specialized equipment. But the

946
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,839
challenges can be that well you don't

947
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,319
have imaging so you're definitely going

948
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,119
to have lower spatial resolution even

949
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:07,440
when the spot sizes are very high in

950
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:09,760
resolution. Um so in in many tissue

951
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,119
types you often find in the current

952
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,200
state of technology that you can't

953
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,800
necessarily resolve individual cells

954
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:20,480
with super high confidence. um as as you

955
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,160
have RNAs that are binding to your

956
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,200
capture surface you might have some

957
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,319
potential RNA loss during that tissue

958
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,920
removal. Um alternatively when you have

959
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:33,359
cellbased actually it's not listed here

960
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,880
but you know once you tag the tissue you

961
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,280
have your whole tissue but during the

962
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,720
dissociation you might actually lose um

963
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,200
have some dropout of cells as well. um

964
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,839
when the RNA is actually diffusing into

965
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,800
onto the array the diffusion might not

966
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,960
just be you know clear one to one but

967
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,200
actually like sideways diffusion as well

968
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,920
so that could also blur some spatial

969
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,760
boundaries but um one thing I I

970
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,760
mentioned is that you know the spot size

971
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,800
isn't everything so we might think that

972
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,160
looks very very high resolution so for

973
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:09,920
instance stereo seek which

974
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:13,040
um has you know I think 200ish ish

975
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,240
nanomar resolution. They actually find

976
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:21,440
that when they're trying to assign cells

977
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:24,800
to uh or spots to cells, it it'll be

978
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,200
like 400 spots that are are encompassing

979
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,640
the cell, but they because they have so

980
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,520
many spots, then they actually have to

981
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,640
bin it to include be more inclusive of

982
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,160
its neighbors. So, so I guess the spot

983
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,480
size isn't everything in terms of

984
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:43,440
resolution. And also um I guess this can

985
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,880
be higher cost per sample um depending

986
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,520
on the fabrication of the capture

987
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:52,880
arrays. So if you're choosing a method I

988
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,520
think uh uh yeah a nice way to approach

989
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,760
this is by you know first defining your

990
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,839
biological hypothesis and what is your

991
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,480
actual question of interest. Is this

992
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,800
more for you know discovery? Are you

993
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,040
looking for something new that maybe you

994
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,960
weren't looking for or are you

995
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,839
validating something or do you need to

996
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,920
do take a more targeted approach and

997
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,920
what are your gene coverage coverage

998
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,000
needs? So maybe you don't need to target

999
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,000
the entire transcripttome but maybe you

1000
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,599
do. What are your resolution

1001
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,960
requirements? Do you need to be looking

1002
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:27,280
at the subcellular level or is it more

1003
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,599
you're uh interested in like you know

1004
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,240
general broad structures in which case

1005
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:36,480
perhaps the tiny resolution differences

1006
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:38,560
actually really don't matter to you. Um

1007
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,119
uh and then I guess scale goes uh

1008
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,760
handinhand with that. Another thing to

1009
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:46,079
consider is the sample type. So, you

1010
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,880
know, a lot of these technologies

1011
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,119
actually require fresh frozen tissues,

1012
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,800
especially because RNAs degrade very

1013
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,640
quickly and need to be um uh preserved

1014
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,640
correctly and the moment you fix it,

1015
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,079
you're introducing a lot of these cross

1016
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,640
links that can be damaging. Um, however,

1017
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,400
like FFP tissues for instance, again,

1018
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,359
it's formal and fixed paraffin embedded.

1019
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,000
So they're these wax cassettes of all

1020
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,000
these archival human specimens across

1021
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,359
basically every pathology department in

1022
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,319
every hospital. It's so widely

1023
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:22,000
available. Um and is is is the

1024
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,800
preservation method like you don't have

1025
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,520
a choice in the type of fixation or can

1026
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,520
you actually um choose the fixation type

1027
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:32,160
because you are planning the experiment

1028
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:35,119
and collecting the tissues yourself. So

1029
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:37,680
um I think the technology you choose

1030
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,079
might not have a FFP compatibility. So

1031
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,000
that is something to

1032
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:44,240
consider and uh section thickness of

1033
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,640
what you want to capture as well as u

1034
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:52,240
the tissue quality of what's available.

1035
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:54,880
Um I think a couple other things to

1036
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,520
consider is you know the actual

1037
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,240
technical expertise that that are that

1038
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:04,520
is around you and all of these

1039
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:08,079
technologies often um require very heavy

1040
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,920
computational support or skills. Um I

1041
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,400
think some commercialized technologies

1042
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,359
try to streamline that for you but uh

1043
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,000
that is definitely something that's uh

1044
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:19,680
not to be overlooked. And finally uh

1045
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,200
there are you know very practical

1046
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,520
considerations in terms of available

1047
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,119
infrastructure. So is the equipment

1048
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:30,880
available? Um what are your budget

1049
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:33,359
restraints like and uh and do you want

1050
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,119
flexibility in in what the technology

1051
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,800
does? So if it's commercially supported

1052
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:41,280
it's going to be very expensive and um

1053
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,839
probably a lot less flexible than if

1054
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,359
you're working with an open platform or

1055
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:49,520
something that a collaborator might

1056
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:52,000
have. Um so perhaps that is much cheaper

1057
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,480
and also but and also provides greater

1058
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,040
flexibility. Okay. Okay. So in terms of

1059
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,359
future directions so what's still hard

1060
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,599
is I just mentioned that FFP sample

1061
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:03,640
compatibility can remain challenging for

1062
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:07,160
actually like most of these tech uh

1063
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:09,440
applications. Um and you know if you can

1064
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,200
proactively actually fix the tissues

1065
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,880
yourself that's that's very nice because

1066
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,960
you can control it but often it's

1067
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,200
hyperfix. So that's that's very

1068
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,760
difficult to get around and um you know

1069
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,280
in our lab as well as in many other labs

1070
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,280
we're trying to figure out how to

1071
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,280
actually extract more RNA information

1072
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,520
even if there are these archival

1073
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,680
specimens that that we can't choose how

1074
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,440
they're fixed. The cost barriers still

1075
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,040
can remain high and the computational

1076
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,680
demands like I mentioned um can require

1077
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:39,440
a lot of work and and the other thing is

1078
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,160
across all of these technologies there's

1079
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,319
actually very little standardization. So

1080
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,800
you know in terms of common benchmarks

1081
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:49,359
uh I think it's it's it can be a little

1082
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,839
bit difficult to really um standardize

1083
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:55,440
across all the technologies in terms of

1084
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:57,640
what is coming up in the inter uh the

1085
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,079
immediate to intermediate term

1086
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,160
um is you know technological

1087
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,760
advancements we're going to you know

1088
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,079
technologies are going to continue to

1089
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,079
become higher resolution and uh one

1090
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,839
thing we didn't I kind of mentioned but

1091
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:12,560
we didn't really elaborate on is

1092
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,079
actually the capture area. So, you know,

1093
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,599
a lot of these might be, you know,

1094
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,160
millimeters

1095
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:23,040
uh big in terms of the surface area

1096
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:25,760
you're looking at. Um up to 13 cm is I

1097
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,440
think what I have seen published. Um but

1098
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,680
I think scaling up the capture area

1099
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,760
consistently so that people people can

1100
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,800
you know not have to subsample their

1101
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:38,079
tissue in to a very tiny area. the

1102
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,160
compatibility with FFP tissues. Um you

1103
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,839
know that most of these protocols are

1104
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,079
incredibly timeconuming. So how do we

1105
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,319
streamline that to a faster workflows

1106
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:48,640
and increasing multiomix capabilities so

1107
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:50,880
that um we can really combine all the

1108
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,319
OMIX together to really scale this up

1109
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,480
and get more uh rich

1110
00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:58,240
information. One thing uh that I'm

1111
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,000
personally interested in is pathology

1112
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,839
integration. So a lot of you know

1113
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
neurodeenerative diseases or all

1114
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:06,240
neurodeenerative diseases have these

1115
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,200
protein pathologies that may not be

1116
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,040
inside well one it's protein and two um

1117
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,160
it may not be inside the nucleus

1118
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:15,440
especially when you're using a

1119
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,920
dissociation based technology. So um uh

1120
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,760
so in really integrating that and being

1121
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,079
able to capture you know

1122
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,800
multi-dimensional information uh would

1123
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,880
be useful and finally uh I think there's

1124
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,000
a lot of computational advances that

1125
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,319
will be very exciting. So you me you

1126
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,200
asked about 3D reconstruction. So that's

1127
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:39,440
definitely in the works. Um really you

1128
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:42,040
know really studying on a like higher

1129
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,640
throughput level uh the cellular

1130
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,960
communication networks and their

1131
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:48,720
proximity. And finally, you know, if you

1132
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:52,760
can use machine learning models to

1133
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:55,599
actually do feature extraction um from

1134
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,760
images uh or just pattern recognition

1135
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:01,119
and spatial data, perhaps there will

1136
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:03,440
come a day when we have outputed enough

1137
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,280
really high quality data sets that we

1138
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,720
will be able to actually just image a

1139
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,960
cell and potentially uh be able to infer

1140
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,920
its transcrytoic state. So I think that

1141
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,960
is probably a slightly longer term

1142
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:21,440
perhaps not so long because AI is crazy.

1143
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:23,520
Um but uh that that is uh yeah what I

1144
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,680
think are exciting future directions.

1145
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,839
And finally, this is the last slide is

1146
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,160
that I just wanted to uh say you know

1147
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:32,880
there are all these technologies but uh

1148
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,599
you know from the history of you know

1149
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,920
the foundations before spatial the

1150
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,400
current era of spatial transcrytoics to

1151
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,000
now you know spatial transcrytoics has

1152
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,839
come a really long way across all of

1153
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,680
these species and using all these

1154
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:48,079
various technologies you see all of

1155
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,240
these beautiful spatially resolved uh

1156
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,480
figures and I just think that's really

1157
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,680
exciting and I hope that you are excited

1158
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,240
about it

1159
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,760
Um this is just for further reading

1160
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,680
reading if you're interested. This is

1161
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,839
not a comprehensive list at all but it

1162
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,000
will be in the slide deck so that you

1163
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:06,800
can refer to it if you want to read more

1164
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,480
about any technologies and thank you for

1165
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,880
your attention and I will be happy to

1166
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,880
take any questions.

1167
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,640
Thank you so much. I think because of

1168
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,200
time we'll end here but if you have

1169
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,680
questions just please stick around. Uh

1170
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:25,240
no seminar today and we'll see you next

1171
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,240
week. Thanks everybody.
