1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:09,840
so before I introduce um today's lecture

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,519
I want to just mention that this is this

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,320
lecture um which is being presented in

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:20,880
conjunction with the broad MIT seminar

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:25,880
series is really um the MIT chemical

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,560
biology group lecture and so um it was a

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:32,360
longstanding lecture at MIT that was

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:37,200
first first held in

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:43,440
1979 and this lecture was in endowed by

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,680
um Ty Shen so Ty Shen was uh postto with

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,800
Arthur cop at

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,640
MIT in the

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:55,840
1950s and he worked on conversion of

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,680
carbohydrates to synthetic intermediates

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,600
so of course he was super ahead of his

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,640
time in recognizing some of the most

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,400
important

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,479
biomolecules he then joined Merc and um

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,400
there he was an execu he became an

20
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:17,119
executive uh director and he in he uh

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,119
developed the drug in Dano

22
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:25,040
methes um a leading uh

23
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,520
NAD so he had an illustrious career at

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,840
MC and then he really thought that one

25
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,360
thing that is important at universities

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,399
is to have amazing external speakers

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,119
come because they can really change the

28
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:47,799
landscape and give people new ideas and

29
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:51,200
um and so he endowed this lectureship to

30
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:54,479
provide MIT with the opportunity to have

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,560
incredible outstanding scientists come

32
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:02,399
and many of the people who have come um

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,960
have gone on to win Nobel Prize and so

34
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,719
um it's an incredible group of people

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,399
that have come through this lecture ship

36
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:13,800
I can just mention a few that are in

37
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:17,040
that category um Carolyn

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,640
bertoy uh let's see I got to scan

39
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,640
through this

40
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,599
list

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,200
um well I'll just mention um we've had a

42
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:34,760
couple of people who have won the the

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,680
um uh a number of important Awards you

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,239
can you can hopefully tomorrow pick up a

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,040
copy of this brochure so this is a two

46
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,879
lecture series there's a lecture today

47
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,159
and then tomorrow we'll have a lecture

48
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,560
in a hopefully little bigger room so

49
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:53,319
that everyone can

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:56,959
fit um so just to mention this um is

51
00:02:53,319 --> 00:03:01,159
being conducted in uh along with the

52
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:04,120
broad MIT lecture series and you can see

53
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:07,159
um also that we have a great lineup for

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,280
that lecture series as well and we want

55
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:12,680
to um again thank the sponsors of that

56
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,120
lecture series which is up on the board

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,200
so really MIT and then these units are

58
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,680
the major sponsors of this so um let me

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:26,840
go ahead and do the more important thing

60
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,080
um for me to focus on now um in addition

61
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,040
to the great

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,519
acknowledgements um let me just

63
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,280
introduced Jim and I'm have my little

64
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,360
cheat sheet here so I make sure that I

65
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:41,360
get things right so um today's lecture

66
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,080
Jim Wells is really in the spirit of the

67
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,040
amazing people that have held this

68
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,680
lectureship previously um Jim started

69
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,400
his career at Genentech where he was a

70
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,400
founding member of the protein um

71
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,079
engineering department and in at

72
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,319
Genentech he did a number of things he

73
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:04,599
really uh showed

74
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,560
how enzymes can be engineered to have

75
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:10,239
new

76
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:13,000
properties and his his lab engineered uh

77
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,079
sisin to have a number of properties

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,320
that the enzyme didn't intrinsically

79
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,639
have he then went on to think about um

80
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,080
not only how enzymes work but how

81
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,000
protein protein interactions are

82
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,520
involved in signaling and he was a

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,639
Pioneer in understanding and unraveling

84
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,560
how how human growth hormone works a

85
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,400
paradigmatic signaling

86
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,600
pathway he and in the course of this he

87
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,680
always uses his knowledge his deep

88
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,199
knowledge of chemistry enzymes protein

89
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,080
chemistry to design new and think about

90
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,039
new therapeutic strategies that can

91
00:04:52,080 --> 00:05:00,960
teach us new biology and um Advanced

92
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:02,880
medicine so he not only um figured out

93
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,560
these signaling Pathways he also

94
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,160
introduced common strategies that we use

95
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:14,520
today like alanine scanning

96
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,639
mutagenesis so in 1998 he left genitech

97
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,919
to start a new company

98
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,919
sunis and there he was the founder and

99
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:26,880
the head and that that uh company really

100
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:30,880
pioneered the method of tethering using

101
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,720
uh coent linkages to identify uh lead

102
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,639
compounds that might occupy protein

103
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:42,280
binding sites so again a very clever use

104
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:45,840
of chemistry to find new uh lians so in

105
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:49,919
2005 he uh went to

106
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:53,800
UCSF and there he continued to on this

107
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,800
strategy so he's developed um he studied

108
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,240
protease signaling Cascades he showed

109
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,759
how proteases could be co-opted to to

110
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:08,000
investigate uh pathways on a global

111
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,560
scale he um he developed many many new

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,440
methods and you you will see that in his

113
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:18,120
talk every time I read a Wells paper I'm

114
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:21,560
like oh that is so cool that's a really

115
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,400
neat new way to think about the problem

116
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,080
and so Jim just keeps doing this over

117
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,759
and over and over and probably many of

118
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,520
you have seen some of his recent work

119
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,840
studying the surface home and also

120
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,319
really exciting work um developing new

121
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:41,080
strategies for proximity labeling so

122
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,400
again and again just new and exciting

123
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,240
things so Jim we are so happy to have

124
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,759
you here and we're really looking

125
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,780
forward to your lecture which is

126
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:56,650
entitled I don't

127
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,650
[Applause]

128
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,639
know okay can can you hear me

129
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:07,160
okay okay great um wow Laura that was a

130
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,919
great uh intro and I have to say you

131
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,520
have to love the spontaneity of this

132
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:14,199
woman just had to deal with it something

133
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,000
that collapsed downstairs now up here

134
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,080
everybody's here seated it's just

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,120
awesome to see everybody here I'm so

136
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,160
honored to be here today uh whenever I

137
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,080
come and and I wish I have I'll probably

138
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,960
take a screenshot of this and send it

139
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,039
back home to my to my family uh it's

140
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,520
like the Hollywood of science you know

141
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:36,440
it's like everybody it compacted into a

142
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,000
very small area with the scientific

143
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,479
intensity that's it's it's uh just

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,720
really hard to beat it's just an amazing

145
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:46,120
place so I appreciate that and if you

146
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,000
don't mind I am going to take a

147
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:54,639
picture let's see get you guys to say

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,159
hello wave or how about K La

149
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,159
Harris there we go all right I got

150
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:03,680
it all right right well so thank you so

151
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:05,560
much Laura for this invitation and to

152
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,479
give this I'm honored to be part of this

153
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,360
group um just a uh uh want to start here

154
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,000
um so that ball there with a bunch of

155
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,759
fingers on it is meant to be a cell

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,840
member and a cartoon of a cell memberane

157
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,240
and and what my lab is focused on is how

158
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,919
the cell surfaceome changes from a

159
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,919
healthy state to a disease State and

160
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,639
then build modulators to modulate this

161
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,159
set of proteins membrane proteins

162
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,959
there's about 5,000 genes that encode

163
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,839
the uh membrane surfaceome and secreted

164
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,200
protein uh set so quarter of nearly a

165
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:44,000
quarter of the genome is devoted to it

166
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,480
um and it's an incredible compartment

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,120
for drug Discovery half the drugs small

168
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,200
molecule drugs engage this compartment

169
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,560
and virtually all of the biologics drugs

170
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,800
do and then you may wonder why there's a

171
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,800
pirate ship sitting on top of that cell

172
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,000
that's meant to be my lab I consider

173
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,600
them Pirates

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,120
we we behave like Pirates we break

175
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,880
things and then we put them back

176
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,240
together we hunt for Treasure Etc um and

177
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,680
the other aspect of this is I call

178
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,519
pirating proteins to attack the C cancer

179
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,519
surface Zone because unlike the great

180
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:22,240
minds of David Baker or Bill deg gr who

181
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,200
would buil build things from scratch um

182
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,720
my lab focuses just on taking parts from

183
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,200
nature fashioning them in a way that can

184
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:35,920
be utilized to do these uh these

185
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,200
activities so um my uh inspiration for

186
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,360
the surfaceome came from the simple

187
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,760
micrograph uh from a colleague of uh uh

188
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:49,279
UCSF colleague sarra bapi who is

189
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:52,440
studying how kras and other enogen alter

190
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:55,920
the the alter cells when I saw this

191
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:59,920
micrograph of going from a um from a

192
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:03,760
what I call a fried egg to a Quant all

193
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,839
due to the trans transformation by kras

194
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,519
I was just going what the hell what's

195
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,360
going on in the cell surface here and so

196
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,480
we got really intrigued that's was sort

197
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,079
of our our ENT entry into this about 10

198
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,839
years ago when we started this work and

199
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:22,560
so we wondered can we find kasas induced

200
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:25,120
surface targets and if we did even in

201
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,360
these isogenic comparisons we might been

202
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,079
be able to identify new service targets

203
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,000
that we could attack uh right which then

204
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,079
was

205
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,839
undruggable thanks now to Kon shokat and

206
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,440
his his work it's now is druggable but

207
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,079
then it wasn't we could attack kras from

208
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,040
the outside with the uh you know the

209
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,560
consequence of kras uh transformation so

210
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,160
that was our rationale and it started

211
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,000
here with with h a postto in my lab

212
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,440
Kevin Le young and a really talented

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,880
graduate student Alex martinko that

214
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,040
utilized a self-surface uh capture

215
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,959
method that was developed in Rudy aol's

216
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,519
lab where you can take um you know there

217
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,600
are carbohydrates on the surface of

218
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,519
cells right

219
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,079
Laura and you can take those

220
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:13,839
carbohydrates and mildly priate oxidize

221
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,959
their cyc acids for instance to alahh

222
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:20,160
that alahh creates a handle for biotin

223
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,440
hydrazide a hydrazide with biotin on it

224
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,880
to label those membrane proteins and

225
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,760
carbohydrates are are very unique to the

226
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,760
cell surface especially complex ones and

227
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,079
we that way we could enrich the cell

228
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,959
surfaceome because as I mentioned it's

229
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:38,000
only uh you know a quarter of the genome

230
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:41,040
is encoded there but the concentration

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,360
of membrane proteins is about 1% the

232
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,120
concentration of so cytosolic proteins

233
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,880
so yes you could do this by mass

234
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,760
spectrometry just lysate mass

235
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,519
spectrometry and people do um but uh we

236
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,440
prefer these enrichment methods because

237
00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:00,120
it gives us a much deeper dive into

238
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,760
what's there um so using a KAC approach

239
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,120
where we take the the Kos transform

240
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,120
cells or or the um uh the vector control

241
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,600
we can compare what was there and you

242
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:14,560
get these volcano plots where you see

243
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:17,079
here uh from0 to six in log two units

244
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,800
the induction of proteins from kayas and

245
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,920
it's a bidirectional remodeling event

246
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,600
some things go up like these proteins

247
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,199
here some things go down like these

248
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,480
proteins here and so it's not just that

249
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:31,639
the enco Gen induces all of this new

250
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,440
protein expression no it's remodeling

251
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:35,320
because the cell is learning to do

252
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,920
something new it's learning to be

253
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,279
transformed and it's learning to

254
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,240
metastasize and in fact when we map

255
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,480
these onto the sort of Hallmarks of

256
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,360
cancer you would see that most of these

257
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,120
things are involved in tumor

258
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,240
metastases uh immune Invasion uh other

259
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,160
other forms that are well known to to

260
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:57,279
induce uh uh uh transformation knowing

261
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,000
these Ecto domains we chose the single

262
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,959
pass ones uh which have just a single

263
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,160
Ecto domain a transmembrane domain an

264
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,760
intracellular domain we clipped off the

265
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,760
EO Ecto domains expressed those and then

266
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:12,720
generated antibodies to these targets to

267
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,560
then follow them in different uh uh in

268
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,639
different cancer settings and from there

269
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,360
some really interesting things came out

270
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:22,480
of that this one protein cdcp1 Cub

271
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:27,079
domain containing protein one which is

272
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,519
an anti- anous protein uh we' made some

273
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:30,399
antibodies to that and those have been

274
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,959
licensed out several of these others

275
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,800
have been as well and so we use that as

276
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:39,000
a sort of as our launch pad for getting

277
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,519
into the surfaceome and what it what it

278
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,360
does find out what's upregulated in the

279
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,240
surfaceome but there are many other

280
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,480
things that happen on the surfaceome and

281
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,440
cancer and one of them most important is

282
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,000
proteolysis so it's well known that this

283
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,560
the the business of metastasis happens

284
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,600
with uh remodeling the tme and that's

285
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,800
the induction of of protasis for

286
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,680
instance

287
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,480
as are many other things so proteases

288
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,920
can are involved in a number of things

289
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,560
on the outside of cells they're involved

290
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,639
in protein shedding many of the growth

291
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,759
factors that are produced in cyto kindes

292
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,000
are produced as membrane bound things

293
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:19,480
they're shed by proteases and then that

294
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,920
goes off and then activates neighboring

295
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,560
milu and or autocrine uh activation of

296
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,480
them uh themselves they receptor

297
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,320
activation events in fact most of the

298
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,639
proteolytic events that happen on the

299
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,000
surface of cells that are well annotated

300
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:37,600
are activation events shedding is that

301
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,480
way okay um and these these protolytic

302
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,560
events uh are associated with all of

303
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,079
these different phenotypes here growth

304
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,639
survival death angiogenesis Invasion

305
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:50,839
metastasis inflammation immune Invasion

306
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,440
and through knockout studies many of the

307
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:55,680
proteases that that are doing this work

308
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,199
are shown down

309
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,199
below so it's interesting because um of

310
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,199
the post transational modifications that

311
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,759
occur on the surface of a cell and

312
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,199
there's not that many only about a

313
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:10,120
handful compared to inside the cell

314
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,720
where there's many and they uh

315
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,199
phosphorilation def phosphorilation

316
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,600
ubiqutination de ubiquit all of these

317
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:20,120
they're all reversible inside so there's

318
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,560
the writers and erasers inside but

319
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,240
outside the cell there's only the

320
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,880
writers the all these things are

321
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,199
irreversible and proteolysis is an

322
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,160
obvious one and it's the most highly

323
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,240
regulated one too so even though there's

324
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,000
glycosilation out there which is super

325
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,000
important the the the regulatory

326
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,519
features of that are not what they are

327
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,399
certainly in cancer with proteolysis so

328
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,720
we wanted to understand this uh um the

329
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,680
proteases involved and especially what's

330
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,199
being cleaved on the cell surface so we

331
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,079
could identify some of the things that

332
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,000
we don't know about that we would that

333
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,319
we would find out about so that was the

334
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,560
question we asked can we discover the

335
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:01,720
proteic cleavage sites on the surface of

336
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,000
cells because while we know a lot about

337
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,759
the proteases very little was known

338
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,319
about this in fact when we started this

339
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,639
work there were only about three dozen

340
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:12,360
annotated proteolytic events which had

341
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,639
been characterized to occur on the

342
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,920
outside of the cell I told you there's

343
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,639
5,000 proteins there's got to be more

344
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:23,560
than just three dozen so um to study

345
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,839
what was actually being uh what was

346
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,079
being cleaved on the surface of cells we

347
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,920
hearkened back to A protein that uh

348
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,440
Laura mentioned uh that we were working

349
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,680
on a Genentech s liin and we had

350
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,600
fashioned that to be like resistant to

351
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,920
oxidants which then turned into

352
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,120
detergent and we fashioned it to have a

353
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,120
better specificity we also with two

354
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,759
mutations and these were rational

355
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,279
mutations these were these were not

356
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,560
quote directed Evolution mutations these

357
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,680
were based on structural inspection and

358
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,880
mechanistic insight some of which came

359
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,079
from Tom Kaiser's group with two

360
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,240
mutations we were able to take sisin

361
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:01,079
which is a ferocious protease found here

362
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,280
in

363
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:07,520
tide this was actually I think that that

364
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:10,959
suyon may have been the first engineered

365
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,240
protein that was sold but protein

366
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,559
engineered protein and it was sold here

367
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,839
for the work uh for uh use in in tide

368
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,959
okay so we with two mutations you could

369
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:25,160
convert This ferocious protease this

370
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:27,880
sering uh 221 cysteine because it's a

371
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,240
cysteine class protease and making more

372
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,760
room for the Cy this allows it to to

373
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:37,240
form an ACL tho ACL enzyme intermediate

374
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:41,760
so this um because cystines are much

375
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:44,799
more prone to amiz than than hydroly it

376
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,640
we could then use it as a peptid ligase

377
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,160
where uh the alpha amine of a second

378
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,280
peptide would come in displace that and

379
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,000
create an uh a new peptide bond so we

380
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,080
could use this for synthesis it didn't

381
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,360
work so well at first but with this

382
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,280
additional mutation here proling 225

383
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,600
alanine allows this more room so it

384
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:07,720
actually carries out this almost as

385
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,200
efficiently as it will carry out

386
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,559
proteolysis this enzyme then has been

387
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,960
used in a lot of different uh uh

388
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,080
applications for instance blockwise

389
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,600
peptide synthesis um yeah great to talk

390
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,120
to the uh uh uh the group today who's

391
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,559
making uh synthetic proteins here this

392
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,679
might be helpful there um cyclic

393
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,280
peptides bio conjugation but the use

394
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,799
that we were going to apply it to is

395
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,400
this one here which we call n

396
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:41,000
terminomics where we can tag the newly

397
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:44,520
formed uh uh proteolytic events with

398
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,200
satell liase plus a peptide Esther tag

399
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,039
so the way that works is that we take um

400
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,280
satellite we take our uh extract this

401
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:56,640
was first applied to study apoptosis in

402
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,919
in cells we took lates from cells which

403
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,440
which would undergo apoptosis namely

404
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,640
caspase cleavage that would generate new

405
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,000
ENT termin if we had sellig gaze in this

406
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,480
tevest peptide which has a a biotin on

407
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,600
one end a tev proteas cite in the middle

408
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,799
and a and a a mass tag which would stay

409
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,320
Remnant once tagged we could generate

410
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,200
this ACL enzyme intermediate with s

411
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,440
liase and then the new ENT Terminus from

412
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,679
A protein that had been cleaved or

413
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,720
resident uh uh uh already cleaved would

414
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,799
come in displace that now it's

415
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,360
biotinated we can pull that out and

416
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:37,520
sequence then the thing the uh the

417
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:40,000
protein that was now uh contained this

418
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,559
Mass tag and that gives us exactly the

419
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,240
Precision of where it was cleav because

420
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,640
it's sitting there right on the alpha

421
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,039
amine the enzyme will not tag will not

422
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,960
use Epsilon Amino groups of Lysine it

423
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:57,320
will only use uh the uh the Alpha amines

424
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:00,760
from uh from peptides so we fashioned

425
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:04,159
this to um to then be for apoptosis

426
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,720
we've been uh studying that that aspect

427
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,039
but we wanted to use it on the on the uh

428
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,039
cell surface so enter um Amy weeks a

429
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:15,559
postto who's now at University of

430
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:17,919
Wisconsin Amy then engineered additional

431
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:20,600
variants of SLE lias to make it uh even

432
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,480
broader specificity and showed that we

433
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:27,200
could take um uh uh tried to apply

434
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,080
subtle lias to the cell surface but

435
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,919
unfortunately when we did we got very

436
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,679
few peptide IDs when we just added

437
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,600
soluble sellig gaze with the tag very

438
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,559
few IDs and Amy came up with the idea

439
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,360
that hey maybe the thing to do is to

440
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:44,960
tether it onto the cell surface and that

441
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,520
way rather than trying to tag thing from

442
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,880
from the outside we tag them on the lawn

443
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,320
of the cell so like rather than mowing

444
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,240
the lawn with a helicopter you mow it

445
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,600
with a lawn mower on the ground okay so

446
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,760
so using this we showed that we were

447
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,240
getting now many many many more IDs the

448
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:05,799
the liation occurs very quickly within

449
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,799
10 minutes we basically saturate the

450
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:11,720
cell surfaceome with uh of the intermed

451
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,320
that we could uh access you inactivate

452
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,840
the active site cysteine now with an

453
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,440
allinine it's dead so there's no so we

454
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,320
knew it was coming from there then enter

455
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,159
uh Katie Schaefer and Irene Louie um a

456
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,320
postto and graduate student in the lab

457
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,480
and they were able to make another

458
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,360
variant of this that did not require

459
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,520
genetic uh engineering to get it into

460
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,720
the membrane but rather just simple uh

461
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,159
um attachment because what we did was we

462
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,559
put a uh an oxim on the end Terminus of

463
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,080
sleaze and then with mild priet

464
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:47,480
oxidation we could then jump on the

465
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,039
sugars that were there so this allows us

466
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:53,039
to label not just through genetic

467
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:57,480
engineering of the cell but through any

468
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,279
cell primary cells uh uh tumor cells Etc

469
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,200
we could simply add this agent it'll

470
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,760
stick on the cell surface and allow

471
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,960
labeling and doing that we could show

472
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,799
robust labeling on the cell surface with

473
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,559
sub liase when it's fluorescently tagged

474
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:17,039
and very robust um bation now of cell

475
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:18,480
surface uh proteins um this allowed us

476
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,480
to pick this

477
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,120
aminooxy uh uh attachment uh liant

478
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,400
because we got more robust labeling with

479
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,720
that so then we started labeling the

480
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:35,679
cell surface on first of just um uh some

481
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:38,279
uh primary cells nkt cells CDH cd4s or

482
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,400
some tumor cell lines adherent cells and

483
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,000
what we found was that uh we identified

484
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,840
for each of these different cell lines

485
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,559
we identified about 300 different

486
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:53,480
proteolytic events so imagine we were at

487
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:55,799
36 and now we're over 300 per cell line

488
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,240
so we in total we identified something

489
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:01,840
like in these six cell uh cell lines we

490
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:06,799
identified almost 500 proteins the

491
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,760
interus of them um uh uh and about and

492
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,360
we of course we see signal peptide

493
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:16,039
cleavage this is about 11% of our uh

494
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,279
cuts are that we also see then um other

495
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:21,000
cleavages and especially those in the

496
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:23,840
extracellular region of the of the of

497
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,720
the protein so remember these proteins

498
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,840
have in some cases very large

499
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,799
extracellular domains most most of the

500
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,840
cuts we see are are in those domains um

501
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,480
now most of them we don't know their

502
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,159
their functions we don't know what they

503
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,880
do but um it it provides a lot of Gris

504
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,039
for study since the annotated literature

505
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,880
would suggest many of these perhaps most

506
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,960
of these are going to be gain a function

507
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:53,279
in their uh uh in their character uh

508
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,600
interestingly we get uh both type one

509
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,679
and type two remember type two is turned

510
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,520
around backwards so the C Terminus is

511
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,360
out the you think about that if you've

512
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,840
cut it there is no Alpha amine that's

513
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,200
present on the thing that might be shed

514
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,360
so what that means is for this class

515
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,240
these are proteins for which the the

516
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,640
cleave fragment remains attached to its

517
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,840
it its parent um we also there's a whole

518
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,799
bunch of multipass cleavages that happen

519
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:26,240
now um some of those uh are known to be

520
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:29,240
um activating uh like the uh par for

521
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,960
instance which is a trans it's a 7tm

522
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,960
receptor that gets activated that's the

523
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,880
only one that's annotated but there's

524
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,200
many more that that are here that we

525
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,320
don't yet know

526
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,840
about so then we wondered do these

527
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:45,600
enogen induce differences and to study

528
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:48,320
that we then compared uh for instance um

529
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,840
different uh enogen

530
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,960
transformed uh uh isogenic cell lines

531
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,799
and here what I'm showing is uh kras

532
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,720
versus the empty Vector this is showing

533
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:01,919
the uh cell surface proteolysis

534
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,440
enrichment that we got again we get

535
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,960
bidirectional effects on proteolysis

536
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,320
some events go up some events go down

537
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,360
and along the Y AIS what we're showing

538
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,440
is the expression differences so using

539
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,640
cell surface capture we can determine

540
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,559
how much of each protein is there and so

541
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,559
in each case you can see that there's uh

542
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:26,200
some proteins go up in expression some

543
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:28,480
go down I showed you that earlier um

544
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,520
this is also showing that there's really

545
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,240
only a mild correlation between the

546
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,559
extent of proteolysis and the expression

547
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,240
levels now that that's actually really

548
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:39,679
good news if you want to look at these

549
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,080
as potential drug targets especially the

550
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,279
cleave form because it provides you an

551
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,159
and gate for um specificity and I'm

552
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,720
going to tell you a story about that uh

553
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:53,279
in in just a minute um so we saw as I

554
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,360
mentioned a number uh about three dozen

555
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:59,279
have been annotated some are shown here

556
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,720
in in uh uh red dots we find these

557
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,799
cleavage sites in precisely the same

558
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,360
cleavage site that has been annotated in

559
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:07,640
in the literature so that gives you a

560
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,480
sense of the resolution of the method

561
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,320
the accuracy um and one of our favorites

562
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,840
is this one

563
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,840
cdcp1 I'll come back to that um you see

564
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,840
here if we compare an isogenic cell line

565
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:23,720
that's her two versus kras transformed

566
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,600
generally you you'll see a similarities

567
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,840
between these two they're both very

568
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,880
powerful uh uh proliferative enogen

569
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,520
you can see that we get um most pink on

570
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,840
the right side of this and most mostly

571
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,960
blue on the down on the left side of

572
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,399
this um but there's a lot of differences

573
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,919
between these two so there's customized

574
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:46,960
proteases that are being built here

575
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,279
which are um specific at least in

576
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,840
aggregate for what they can be uh what

577
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:58,039
they will cut so um enter this group of

578
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,799
posts uh giia Joe and Shian Lim uh who's

579
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:01,039
uh

580
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,120
G is currently at uh University of

581
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,320
Chicago and Shan's at jentech they

582
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,960
studied one of the proteins that we

583
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:13,720
found cleaved and that's this protein

584
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:16,000
cdcp1 cdcp1 is a uh has two large

585
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:18,200
domains on the outside transmembrane

586
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,039
domain and an intracellular domain and

587
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:25,480
it's involved in this process of aus so

588
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:28,840
when a cell dissociates from the cell

589
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,000
its Brethren sister its tribe and it's

590
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,640
it's out there in free floating normally

591
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,880
cells will undergo

592
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,200
apoptosis um they know they're doing

593
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:42,840
something wrong illegal maybe um and and

594
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,279
so uh uh but this protein if induced it

595
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:49,480
will induce survival from uh anoas and

596
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:52,480
in fact we saw that here this is a a an

597
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,440
immortalized pancreatic cell which has

598
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,320
very low expression of cdcp1 but as soon

599
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,279
as you add Kass you get a lot of

600
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,760
expression of cdcp1 and in most of these

601
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:08,360
pancreatic cell lines which have Kass

602
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:11,120
you see this cleave form um cdcp1 is

603
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,600
really interesting we found that after

604
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,519
it's cut in one of three places in this

605
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,760
this is an alpha fold model we do not

606
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:21,039
yet have a structure of it but um right

607
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,080
here in this region cut one cut two cut

608
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:27,360
three are is a nested set of three

609
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,640
different cut sites all dibasic in their

610
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,880
character um that can leave uh give rise

611
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,799
to this band that's uh shown here that

612
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,360
would be the the C terminal fragment but

613
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,519
these two these two stay together in the

614
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,360
membrane once it's cut it does not leave

615
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:47,919
so we could express them as uh coexpress

616
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,559
them and these two domains cut here and

617
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,760
there would actually assemble as a

618
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:56,519
single antigen

619
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:59,440
um so it uh we imagine that it looks

620
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,600
like this um we wondered could we make

621
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,880
an antibody that would see this cleave

622
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,840
form because if we did we'd be able to

623
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,399
get something would be much more

624
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:12,120
selective for cancer cells than normal

625
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:15,159
cells um and to do that we we used uh

626
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,480
our phase display Library um Fab phase

627
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:21,799
display Library where we have um the uh

628
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,360
fulllength cdcp1 as an FC Fusion antigen

629
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:28,679
this is a Decoy for us so we take our

630
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,960
Fage Library we we uh um take we the

631
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,799
Fades that would bind the full length

632
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,840
and then positively select for Fades

633
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:38,279
that have the cleave form on them

634
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,600
because we can coexpress the Ecto uh the

635
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:43,799
N Terminus and C terminal domain and

636
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,880
this way we could positively select for

637
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,600
Fage that would bind to the cleave form

638
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,240
and negatively select for things that

639
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,080
bind to the full

640
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:57,080
length and indeed we found such uh such

641
00:29:53,080 --> 00:30:00,440
molecules such antibodies this cl3 a two

642
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,679
nanomolar binder you can see here by B

643
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,200
binds to the cut form 3 it actually

644
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,000
binds to all three of the cut forms so

645
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,120
it's probably not binding right over the

646
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,559
proteolytic site but it's binding nearby

647
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,159
and sees that confirmational difference

648
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:16,360
and it does not bind to the full length

649
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,519
now if we take these these antibodies

650
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:22,399
and we fashion them with uh an ADC a

651
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,360
drug we put a poisonous drug like an Ora

652
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:27,080
Statin analog on them

653
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,880
mmaf um you can see if we put them Just

654
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,519
into a mou

655
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,399
um wild type Mouse not engineered at all

656
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:36,519
just looking at safety here you can see

657
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,720
these three curves at the top are

658
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:42,480
different dose ranges of the antibody to

659
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:46,399
the cleave form of uh

660
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:49,559
cdcp1 and these others which show some

661
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:51,720
dramatically uh toxic effects are the

662
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:53,360
ones which have which are directed to

663
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,519
the fulllength

664
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,760
cdcp1 so in other words making something

665
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:03,559
to the CLE form had much greater safety

666
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:07,000
profile than ones to the full length and

667
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:11,720
then we uh with our colleague Mike Evans

668
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:14,960
at UCSF we then went and um uh uh built

669
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:18,720
an rlt version of this with litium uh

670
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,639
177 on the uh on the antibody and you

671
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,360
can see here unabated the tumor will

672
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:28,159
grow uh wildly um and then it two

673
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:29,880
different doses uh higher um low dose in

674
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:33,240
a higher dose you could see what could

675
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:36,399
dramatically Abate the tumor growth so

676
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,399
this is an example where you have an

677
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:42,279
antigen you know it's functional because

678
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:44,039
it's uh important for the the the tumor

679
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:47,200
itself and in fact it's synthetically

680
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:49,039
lethal for Ras if you knock it out and

681
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,039
but you do have it in other tissues some

682
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,559
other tissues and you don't want to go

683
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,960
there you want to be only on the cancer

684
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:58,960
then Target the thing that's the the

685
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:02,080
consequence of uh a proteolysis and we

686
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,679
can get there um Gia then went on to do

687
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,679
some other really interesting uh uh

688
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,279
selections we wondered well we can build

689
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:12,279
things to the cleave form but what about

690
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,360
protecting these cleavage events so she

691
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:17,440
developed a similar kind of approach we

692
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:21,399
call them bandab bodies like

693
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,840
Band-Aids and uh in in so that the idea

694
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:25,960
was can we block proteolysis by building

695
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,440
an antibody that will sit right over the

696
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:32,919
site of prot proteolysis and prevent the

697
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:35,360
cleavage at all and uh and there's other

698
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,000
consequences not just proteins like

699
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,840
cdcp1 or fa2 that undergo this

700
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,159
activating cutting events but also uh

701
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,960
proteases themselves they are all built

702
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,039
as pro-enzymes that propiece has to be

703
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,440
cleaved to make them active could we

704
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:54,519
find uh bandab bodies that would protect

705
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,320
against that cleavage and and therefore

706
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:59,440
inhibit that uh

707
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:03,080
MMP okay so what we did in this case was

708
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,679
to the trick was we we're going to use

709
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,720
again differential

710
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:11,639
selection uh but we we're going to do it

711
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,880
where we select against the um uh

712
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:16,039
binding to the the cleavage site to

713
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,000
begin with and only and and bind

714
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:22,440
everywhere outside and then select four

715
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,159
directly for that that uh that cut site

716
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,919
and so what we did was we here's the POI

717
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:28,919
this would be the cleav protein of

718
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:32,200
Interest this is be the uh where the

719
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:35,200
cleavage site is we built a mutant poy

720
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,399
which mutated this cleavage site now

721
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,039
what we do is we use this as a negative

722
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:43,360
selection to to scrub away Fage that

723
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,919
would bind to everywhere outside of that

724
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:50,000
cleavage site in a negative selection

725
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,880
mode and then uh then use this antigen

726
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,840
which is basically just a wild type

727
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:56,600
protein with an intact cleavage site to

728
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:00,440
collect those Fades that would bind to

729
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:03,159
that and and indeed that that worked we

730
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,760
could get we call this epitope directed

731
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:10,000
antibody selection it's actually way

732
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,679
easier than directed design I I'll show

733
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,599
you a couple examples of this we did

734
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,839
this in uh uh six different six

735
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:18,679
different examples of this and every

736
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:20,800
time we were able to find an antibody

737
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,159
that would block the proteolytic uh

738
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:28,040
cleavage um so we showed that for

739
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:30,800
instance on uh in in the case of uh um

740
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:34,280
oh uh I was going to skip this because

741
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,280
uh this case here where we have cdcp1

742
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,760
again we wanted to find an antibody that

743
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,079
would sit over there so we built that

744
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,440
the the poy that had poisoned these cut

745
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:47,480
sites and then selected on the wild type

746
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:51,359
and indeed if you add uh

747
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,800
cdcp1 with a um uh uh without the

748
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,359
blocking antibody in plasma plasman

749
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,040
which can cleave it um you can see that

750
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:01,079
you can protect against thatle cleavage

751
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:05,200
with any of these antibodies here um we

752
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:07,880
can also use um uh uh have been able to

753
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,240
show that this processing of

754
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,839
cdcp1 is going on inside the cell

755
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,240
because if we take those antibodies

756
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:17,560
which we've shown can block the

757
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,839
processing they don't prevent the

758
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:24,240
surface processing that we see in fact

759
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:27,119
we showed that by uh taking the gene for

760
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,960
the CLE for the CLE form antibody

761
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,680
expressing it in coexpressing it with

762
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:36,680
cdcp1 and in that case we can prevent

763
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,480
shown here the cleavage of cdcp1 in

764
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,359
other words if they're expressed

765
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,680
together as they traffic through the ER

766
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,680
they you can block the the cleavage but

767
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,680
if you just add the Fab the purified Fab

768
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:52,319
outside it doesn't prevent it so the

769
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,240
proteases can be active in the ER and on

770
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,079
the surface of the cell this is an

771
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,319
experiment that shows us that the

772
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,880
processing is happening in the ER okay

773
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:06,560
we've also applied it to uh uh mmp9

774
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,319
which blocks uh uh uh by blocking the

775
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,040
pro-sequence uh cleavage we're able to

776
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:16,440
find antibodies that prevent the um uh

777
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,000
the activation of the pro uh MMP because

778
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,960
it will autoactivate itself and you can

779
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,880
see some antibodies don't work like

780
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,680
these still gets activated but these

781
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,240
here prevent the processing and those

782
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,240
that are most effective at preventing

783
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:35,359
processing also suppress migration of

784
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,000
cells in a Cell migration assay so these

785
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,760
kinds of approaches I think are going to

786
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,800
be very important we've also done it

787
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,640
with mmp1 and mmp3 you can get highly

788
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,440
selective Inhibitors this way and I just

789
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,119
have to say it is so freaking easy to do

790
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,920
this this is not a rocket science design

791
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,359
project to direct things there all you

792
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,359
need is the differential selection of

793
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:01,000
what you want against what you don't

794
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:04,760
want and you can uh you can get there so

795
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,400
it's very effective um so I may have

796
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,040
time to tell you a bit about what we've

797
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,560
been doing in the protein degradation

798
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,839
area which is another area we've been

799
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,359
modulating uh uh the cell surfaceome um

800
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,839
as you know antibodies are super

801
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:20,319
important modalities about half the

802
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,760
Pharma big Blockbuster drugs are

803
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:26,079
biologics these days most of them are

804
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,200
antibodies um and uh there's one of the

805
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,560
things is so cool about them is that you

806
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,640
have five shots on goal you can bake a a

807
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,760
functional inhibitor you can also bake a

808
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,880
uh antibody drug conjugate or get the

809
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:42,200
immune cell involved with adc's antibody

810
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,440
directed cellular cytotoxicity or bites

811
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,800
or carte cells um so there's a lot of

812
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,720
different things you can do there's

813
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,400
another modality uh we were inspired to

814
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,960
uh to investigate which is can these

815
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,640
these antibodies be harnessed for

816
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,200
extracellular targeted protein

817
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,800
degradation

818
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:05,119
and uh this is inspired by the work on

819
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,839
protax and glues all intracellular so we

820
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,200
call this uh extracellular targeted

821
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,880
protein degradation the the sort of the

822
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,800
pioneer of this was this work done by

823
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,800
Tom aawa at Shou guy who developed these

824
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,160
sweeping antibodies that will bind a

825
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,720
soluble protein take it into the uh get

826
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,920
taken up by the

827
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,520
fcrn uh and so soluble protein shown

828
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,839
here in these little green things and

829
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:34,520
then bind antibody binds it'll get uh

830
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:36,400
moved into the endosome uh where it gets

831
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,920
acidified they've engineered it so you

832
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,000
can get losal release in the endosome

833
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,640
and then it will leave the the Target in

834
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,240
to go to the lome and then finally uh

835
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:51,839
reappear so it can do work this

836
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,319
catalytically the the first uh uh second

837
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,240
example of this was work from Carolyn

838
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:59,680
berto's lab using what they call LX

839
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:03,040
which which are these um antibodies that

840
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:05,680
use a glycan recycling receptor the uh

841
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,599
the Manos chloride independent mano6

842
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:14,280
phosphate receptor so this binds uh uh

843
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:17,000
gly uh poly uh glycans um and by

844
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:20,119
fashioning uh he had to sort of uh

845
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,040
attach a dozen or so of these glycans

846
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:24,800
chains to the antibody that would then

847
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,160
if the antibody binds a cellular

848
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,400
membrane Target then it will traffic it

849
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:32,839
in into the lome for degradation or you

850
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,440
could also use it for soluble um

851
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:38,200
degradation of proteins um as well if

852
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,960
the antibodies directed to a a soluble

853
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:44,160
protein um so that's that that those

854
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,839
were Inspirations for us and um of

855
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,119
course the the the protac or and

856
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:52,760
molecular glue area is one where you

857
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:55,119
have protein of interest uh E3 liay are

858
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,880
brought together with a small molecule

859
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:01,560
that binds each independently um a glue

860
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:04,000
would be where it's one combine both um

861
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:06,440
but in any case once you put them next

862
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,200
to each other you'll get the degradation

863
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,000
ubiqutination of the poy and uh in

864
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,359
subsequent

865
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,280
degradation so we were inspired because

866
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:20,200
there are some E3 liases which are known

867
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,000
which are transmembrane E3 liases this

868
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:25,160
family over here one in particular rnf43

869
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,280
that's involved in Wind signaling has an

870
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,319
E3 liaye domain we wondered could we

871
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,240
bind build an antibody that binds the

872
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:35,359
Ecto domain of barn f43 and have this

873
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:38,440
bind a protein of interest is in a

874
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,599
bispecific format namely uh we did it

875
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:43,440
with first with pdl1 would we get

876
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:46,720
degradation of the product and in fact

877
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:51,079
this did work we're able to degrade

878
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,760
pdl1 uh egfr cdcp1 and actually now a

879
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:54,680
number of other Targets in a company

880
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:58,640
that's been formed called Epi

881
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:03,160
biologics um and uh uh that uh

882
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:06,880
degradation is uh specific to the uh

883
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:11,400
sorry um that degradation requires both

884
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:14,560
arms to work single arm uh uh antibodies

885
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,440
do not degrade pdl1 only the bispecific

886
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,319
does um It's Time dependent uh it's

887
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,760
actually slower than a protac protacs

888
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:26,680
are tend to be uh faster um if you knock

889
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:31,040
down rnf43 it protects if you have more

890
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:32,839
or less of the rnf43 on cells it uh

891
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,640
there's a dose response for the amount

892
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:38,359
that's there generally you have to be

893
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:42,520
within about tfold POI and uh degrader

894
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:45,720
so it can work in a um uh with less uh

895
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:48,160
degrader there than than than po um it

896
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:52,280
requires the lome based on inhibitor

897
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:56,440
studies and um they there's uh a lot of

898
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:59,160
uh uh cool s about this along with uh

899
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:02,640
additional um uh antibodies that can be

900
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,319
brought to bear so um we've also and I

901
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,720
know I'm running out of time so I'm kind

902
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,200
of speeding up here but I also wanted to

903
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,400
tell you about another variant of this

904
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,640
which doesn't use a a transmembrane e3

905
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:19,440
lies like a Protek or or a um uh or a

906
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,400
glue but rather uses just natural

907
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,359
recycling characteristics especially

908
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,400
prevalent in cyto kindes that's the way

909
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:28,839
they're turned off so we said well

910
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,640
rather than having antibody that binds

911
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:33,599
to the uh to the degrader let's just use

912
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,800
a natural ligan that binds to the

913
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,319
degrader the cyto receptor fashion

914
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,640
something on the other side that binds

915
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:42,440
the POI and can we get those degraded

916
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,559
and this is the work of Katarina pants

917
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:48,200
uh from couple of years ago and uh yes

918
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:52,079
we were able to for instance using a

919
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:56,079
degrader to um uh that would uh that

920
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,160
would uh uh bind to the cxcr7 receptor

921
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,240
which binds C

922
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,480
cxcl12 uh we were able to degrade both a

923
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,520
membrane proteins egfr as well as uh

924
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,559
soluble

925
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,000
proteins so um we're really excited

926
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,839
about this and uh this is just showing

927
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,440
the degradation of egfr you can see

928
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:17,200
before treatment and after treatment

929
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,800
egfr just takes a major hit and it's

930
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,079
very specific if you look at the if you

931
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,119
do surface omics as I described earlier

932
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,000
you ask what's being hit in this example

933
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,720
here it was very specific for egfr

934
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,760
versus other things that could be there

935
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,520
um and it kills better than just the

936
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,640
normal antibody wood and uh so we're

937
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,520
also interested in using it for soluble

938
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,400
proteins for instance we showed this in

939
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,440
VF it can take up vef effectively from

940
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,480
outside so all of the soluble proteins

941
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,160
that you can think about could also be

942
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:57,240
amenable here um so uh we're excited

943
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,160
about that this uh company epi biologics

944
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,680
is formed is actually has three

945
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:04,079
different Mo modalities we call them all

946
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,160
epacs depending on the degradation

947
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,119
mechanism that they employ and they've

948
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,280
been very effective in degrading egfr as

949
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,079
an example shown here but a number of

950
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,000
other targets and they promote the the

951
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:20,040
life of of of animals when given to

952
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,800
those that have tumors um so when you

953
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,520
think about this field it's I I'm it's a

954
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,040
very exciting area this uh extracellular

955
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,960
targeted protein degradation it sort of

956
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,640
reminds me of like the early days of

957
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,720
flying because there's many different

958
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,680
variants of this in fact uh at Epi they

959
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,160
now have 230 different degrader systems

960
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,480
that they've identified in screens and

961
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,280
whatnot um and it's uh so it's on its

962
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,520
way I would say it's it's kind of in

963
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,880
this stage here maybe the Spitfire stage

964
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,720
you know we haven't seen the first

965
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,000
clinical trial with these but I think

966
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:57,319
they're soon to come I should mention

967
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
that that the sweeping antibody uh area

968
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:03,480
uh Tom agawa has an approved antibody

969
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,839
for the il6 il6 receptor complex that

970
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,520
circulates so it's shown that

971
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:12,640
degradation of those soluble complexes

972
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:14,520
can have therapeutic benefit so um with

973
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,920
that I I just like to say I hope you get

974
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:20,200
the sense of sort of pirating proteins

975
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:23,200
for extracellular biology I think it's a

976
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:25,599
really exciting area um this is my lab

977
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,800
here and I'm totally indebted to with

978
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,920
I'm just can't believe I get to work

979
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,720
with these great people here two of my

980
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,599
former lab members are

981
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:38,800
here and excited to see them here and uh

982
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:44,369
so with that I'll stop and take any

983
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,369
[Applause]

984
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,520
questions oh there we go didn't take

985
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:01,440
long hi thank thank you um great talk

986
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,960
I'm I guess surprised that the

987
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:08,319
protolytic cleavage of CDC P1 happens

988
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,280
seemingly entirely inside the vesicle

989
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,960
and not in the surface do you think

990
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,119
there's potential to identify a

991
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:18,079
protolytic

992
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:22,760
surfome that you could split into a kind

993
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:25,119
of exclusively surface cleaved lineage

994
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,720
and a

995
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,880
pre-processing cleavage step

996
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:33,440
yeah that's a that's a great question um

997
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,200
I well it's well known that there are

998
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,319
very important proteolytic events that

999
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,680
do happen in the ER many of the hormone

1000
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,880
activating events happen there that are

1001
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,960
constitutive using the what are called

1002
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,760
Pro uh protein

1003
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:52,800
convertases uh or uh uh CX like or furin

1004
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,119
like proteases um but most of the

1005
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,680
proteases are not there most of them are

1006
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:00,319
sitting on the cell membrane and they

1007
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:03,160
get activated like the mmps ETC so I

1008
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:06,280
think uh in our proteolytic in our

1009
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:08,240
proteomics approach we can't distinguish

1010
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,000
where the event happened it just appears

1011
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,520
at the cell surface and then we know

1012
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,040
it's there but when you get then

1013
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:17,040
antibodies to it there is now a way that

1014
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,520
you can actually dissect where it

1015
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:22,480
happened based on adding the antibody

1016
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:27,359
did you block it or expressing the

1017
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,359
antibody did you block it yeah

1018
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:36,280
maybe um I'll just follow up on that

1019
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:39,400
question do you think that there's

1020
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,440
something um different about like

1021
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:45,040
proteostasis or something in the tumor

1022
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:48,400
cells so you get that cleavage prior to

1023
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:51,520
it coming onto the membrane you know is

1024
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,119
there do you guys have any insight into

1025
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:58,440
that yeah Laura I think of I think of

1026
00:47:54,119 --> 00:48:02,440
the cell is basically bristl in with

1027
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:05,119
with um preformed signaling molecules

1028
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,480
now many of them are in the latent form

1029
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,240
and they're just waiting for a

1030
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,800
protolytic event to come along and

1031
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,559
launch them like a missile it happens as

1032
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,680
soon as the you don't have to make it

1033
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:17,640
you don't have to transport it's already

1034
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:20,520
there and that's the way most many

1035
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:22,880
growth factors are activated so I think

1036
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,559
this is the tip of the iceberg here

1037
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,079
which is why one of the areas that we're

1038
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:29,040
really excited about is using some of

1039
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:32,040
the proximity labeling methods I'll talk

1040
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,240
about tomorrow to deorphanize these

1041
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,720
cleave fragments to find out where they

1042
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:40,559
go because there's so much we don't know

1043
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:44,040
about that aspect of it and that's so

1044
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,040
I'm really excited about

1045
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:51,400
that any more trainee questions because

1046
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,079
I okay here we

1047
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:58,400
go hey thank you Jim so uh you mentioned

1048
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:01,119
um that you we're picking these targets

1049
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:04,680
based on for example overexpression of

1050
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,680
certain enogen in isogenic settings but

1051
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,440
um from the perspective of thinking

1052
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:12,359
about Therapeutics in human would it be

1053
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,599
necessary to do the profiling in many

1054
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:17,760
tissues or how do you think about

1055
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:20,200
therapeutic Windows yeah absolutely so

1056
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,760
we get an idea of what might be there

1057
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,319
and what candidates might be there from

1058
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,160
those isogenic

1059
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:29,240
experiments um and we can also test if

1060
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,200
they are from those candidates we can

1061
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,640
find out are they synthetically lethal

1062
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,559
so we can get or look at them by dep map

1063
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,119
for instance and look at that but you're

1064
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:40,839
absolutely right this is not from that

1065
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:42,760
data there to a therapeutic there's a

1066
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:45,440
lot more validation that needs to be

1067
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,440
done multiple cell lines I showed the

1068
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,359
the pancreatic cell line panel that we

1069
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:53,119
did for instance and then uh more and

1070
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:55,599
more my lab is getting into whole tumor

1071
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,160
proteomics to identify these events

1072
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:59,240
there and that

1073
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,400
although you know there's an upside and

1074
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,960
downside to that the upside being it's

1075
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:06,680
in the re it's in a real tumor and it's

1076
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,400
you know somebody had that the downside

1077
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:13,280
is it's not renewable you know so unless

1078
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:15,799
you're in pdxs or you know xenographs so

1079
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:18,880
great question there's these are just

1080
00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:21,680
early Discovery tools that get us into

1081
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,359
candidates and mo molecules that can

1082
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:27,280
bind to to them to probe them in more

1083
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:30,280
depth in a real uh you know real t

1084
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,280
setting

1085
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:36,920
yeah I'm going to allow faculty to ask

1086
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,920
questions

1087
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,920
no

1088
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:46,520
anybody you talk me through a little bit

1089
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,799
about the extracellular tpd I'm thinking

1090
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:49,440
the intracellular protein you're going

1091
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:51,480
to get it ubiquinated and then the

1092
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,680
proteome Chomps the intracellular part

1093
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:56,440
what happens to the extracellular

1094
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,079
stock well in a case where we're using

1095
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:01,440
that

1096
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:04,359
rnf43 um inhibitor studies suggests that

1097
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:08,559
after ubiqutination they do ubiquitinate

1098
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:11,319
their their target um they uh much of it

1099
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,160
goes through the lome um there's not

1100
00:51:11,319 --> 00:51:15,440
there is some inhibition with proteosome

1101
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:19,280
Inhibitors but most of it goes to the

1102
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:22,400
lome and there you know it's you know it

1103
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,880
would be chewed up to uh certainly the

1104
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,000
Ecto domain would be chewed off and then

1105
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,799
what happens to the rest of it I don't

1106
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,520
know the intracellular domain Etc I

1107
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:34,040
don't know maybe that's released but uh

1108
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,000
the Ecto domain would certainly be a

1109
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:40,760
Target and then we see it then degraded

1110
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,760
when we look at the the the whole

1111
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,839
protein you see degradation of any

1112
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,839
Associated

1113
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:52,559
proteins yeah yes yeah do you do you see

1114
00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:54,520
any degradation of the uh Associated

1115
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,119
protein when you do the extracellular

1116
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,480
and and the second question was that

1117
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,240
what do you think the resistance

1118
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,119
mechanism will be so suppose you you

1119
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,960
have an egfr degrader and a classic

1120
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,559
inhibitor versus the egfr degradation

1121
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,680
mechanism that you are using what would

1122
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:10,160
be the difference between the two

1123
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:12,760
resistance

1124
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,799
mechanism yeah if you if it were a small

1125
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:17,359
molecule for instance in inhibiting the

1126
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:19,960
kise domain of egfr then it's known that

1127
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:23,400
you get resistance to the kise inhibitor

1128
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:25,400
binding um in general uh the kind of

1129
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,440
resistance you'd get here would be if

1130
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,319
there's a trafficking mutation that

1131
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,359
would uh affect getting to the lome so

1132
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:36,280
maybe it would just recycle back um uh

1133
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:38,640
Yosi yardin group has shown that uh

1134
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:42,720
comparing kyes small molecule inhibitors

1135
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:44,559
for her two to antibody resistance it's

1136
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,440
harder to get them to the antibody

1137
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,319
because you have to disrupt a protein

1138
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,160
protein interface of the antibody but

1139
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:53,799
you can get them um those are the kinds

1140
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:56,599
of resistance that we would imagine

1141
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:59,599
would would occur oh you asked about

1142
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:03,000
what else gets sucked into the into the

1143
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:05,240
wood chipper yeah so I was actually

1144
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,040
surprised that more doesn't because we

1145
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:10,359
now know I'll talk talk tomorrow about

1146
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:13,240
about horizontal signaling in in

1147
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:16,280
membrane complexes there's actually

1148
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:18,079
around egfr there can be up to 30

1149
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,799
different proteins that visit that in

1150
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,160
the on versus off state of egfr so I was

1151
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:25,640
a little surprised that it was as

1152
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:30,040
selective as it as it is and it may not

1153
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:30,040
be always that that way

1154
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:37,640
yeah thanks

1155
00:53:33,799 --> 00:53:40,200
am well it it's getting late so if there

1156
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:43,359
are no further questions let's thank Jim

1157
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:47,920
again and please come tomorrow for the

1158
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:47,920
second installation of the talk
