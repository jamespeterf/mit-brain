1
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,160
okay so let's start so H first of all

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,199
wow thank you all for coming back I'm

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,439
happy I didn't H you know uh push you

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,960
away uh so before we start with today's

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,359
lectures just a few Logistics so for

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,279
some reasons you guys are taking a

7
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,680
holiday next week unfortunately so we

8
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,719
won't have class A the week after on the

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,520
29th unfortunately I'm away that week at

10
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,480
Germany but we're gonna have our amazing

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,320
Rachel in the back uh give a fantastic

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:52,120
lecture so you know uh you'll enjoy that

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,600
uh and then the week after which I

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,760
believe is October

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,079
6th I would have loved to give you a

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,199
great lecture and I'm here however

17
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,480
you're going to get something even

18
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:07,240
better because there is a really really

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:10,240
amazing work uh new work by ODed RV who

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,080
gave who does a new constructs a new

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,439
factoring algorithm uh uh Quantum

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,040
factoring algorithm uh so kind of

23
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,400
improves Show's algorithms in some way

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,159
uh it's a really really exciting piece

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,040
of work uh odet is in Paris but that's

26
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,840
the one day he was able to come here and

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,799
present his work and it's exactly on

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,640
this class so so I think what we should

29
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:37,119
do we should all this class will move on

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,880
October 6 and we'll all go to od's talk

31
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,439
it's going to be this class it's going

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,640
to be a colloquium and it's going to be

33
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,439
a theory reading group it's going to be

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,360
kind of allinone it's going to have a

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,439
very nice format where the first hour or

36
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,759
so is going to be kind of a very general

37
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,000
theory audience talk and then we're

38
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,600
going to have the

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,360
next two or less hours depending on how

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,000
much he'll have the energy to speak to

41
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,640
us uh we're going to talk about kind of

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,880
more details about his algorithm and his

43
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,439
work so that's October 6th and then I'm

44
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,640
going to be back so you're going to have

45
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,640
a bit of a break for me now uh which I'm

46
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,400
kind of sad about but you may be happy

47
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,760
uh okay so let's first kind of recap uh

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,319
where where we were and and continue

49
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,879
from there uh so last time we defined

50
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,959
kind of this new class of proofs kind of

51
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,640
going away from the classical proofs to

52
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,000
the regime of interactive

53
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,920
proofs we showed the power of these

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,519
interactive proofs by showing one

55
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,480
protocol in particular the sum protocol

56
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,640
I wrote the sum protocol kind of very

57
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,000
Loosely in that uh

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,360
board because we're going to refer to it

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,040
today again so the some protocol just a

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,239
recap it's a way to prove that the sum

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,480
of a multivariate polinomial over let's

62
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,599
say a small set H you can think of H as

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,519
01 as an example over like a Boolean

64
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:03,280
Cube or just a bigger Cube the sum is

65
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,840
some value over some finite field and of

66
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,920
course to compute this sum takes a very

67
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,000
long time it's like H to the m you need

68
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,400
to just sum everything up but it turns

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,560
out that you can verify it using an

70
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,319
interactive proof very very efficiently

71
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,560
assuming you have Oracle access to this

72
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,159
function you can compute it kind of

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,720
efficiently on any random element in the

74
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,560
group in the field so this is what we

75
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,480
covered last time the sum protocol as I

76
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,959
told you this some protocol is really

77
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,519
the bread and butter of proof systems

78
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,200
almost every proof system uses this

79
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,879
protocol it's a beautiful protocol in my

80
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:38,120
opinion uh and we'll see we'll use it

81
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,640
throughout kind of this course so if

82
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,840
anyone has any questions about the

83
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,760
subject protocol please

84
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,439
ask okay and if it doesn't sit with you

85
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,840
yet I really encourage you to review the

86
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,519
notes and kind of uh you know in the

87
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,720
website there's also notes to uh Justin

88
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:58,720
Taylor's um a a survey which contains a

89
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,040
very nice Exposition and also we have

90
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,159
now scribe for that so you know you have

91
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,239
various uh resources to to look at the

92
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,319
protocol okay and then we start to look

93
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,720
at kind of applications for the protocol

94
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:15,560
the first application we got is to show

95
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,600
uh interactive proof for Sharp Set uh

96
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,759
and we showed this interactive the idea

97
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,120
was to it was via this technique of

98
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,600
arithmetization converting kind of a

99
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,960
Boolean circuit into a arithmetic

100
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,199
circuit we'll use this technique today

101
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,919
as well and then we Departed and talked

102
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,840
about this idea of a doubly efficient

103
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,759
interactive proofs where in doubly

104
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,199
efficient interactive proofs we really

105
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,120
care about the runtime of the prover in

106
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,320
addition to the runtime of the verifier

107
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,440
so in the classical interactive proof

108
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,360
setting all the focus was on efficient

109
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,759
verification nobody cared about the

110
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,160
runtime of the prover okay he was for

111
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,120
like for all practical purpose we

112
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,560
thought of of him as like an all

113
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,080
powerful but doubling efficient

114
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,880
interactive proof now there's a yeah the

115
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,120
pro of course is more powerful otherwise

116
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,240
the verifier would do the work on his

117
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,919
own but uh he's not he's not we don't

118
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,440
have all powerful things in this world

119
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,320
unfortunately so we also care about the

120
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,360
efficiency of the prover so he's just

121
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,479
more efficient but not we don't want his

122
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,919
uh to you know his work to be crazy

123
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,120
expensive okay so that was the doubly

124
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,479
efficient attactive proofs and we just

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,639
started and we'll continue today to show

126
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,319
how we get a doubly efficient Tractive

127
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,800
proofs for counting triangles and there

128
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,880
was VI uh uh for count counting

129
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,880
triangles in a graph and it was via

130
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,960
technique called the low degree

131
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:40,280
extension okay so now the plan for this

132
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,520
class today is to look at the low degree

133
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,880
extension okay again this low degree

134
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,120
extension it's a theorem it's written

135
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,759
here uh I'll explain it uh it's again

136
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,479
the bread and butter that's actually

137
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,960
this low deegree extension theorem in

138
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:57,199
some sense is what makes the Su check

139
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,160
protocol so popular so kind of uh

140
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,120
important okay what this the is what

141
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,639
gives the subject protocol its power in

142
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,599
a sense so really together the low

143
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,720
degree extension the low degree

144
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:11,400
extension theorem together with the sum

145
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,800
check is like everything follows from it

146
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,840
like via cories almost okay so we'll

147
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,199
we'll kind of that's what we'll see this

148
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,240
lecture in the next

149
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,880
lecture okay so what is the low degree

150
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:30,720
extension theorem what it says is that

151
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:33,199
take any function from H to the M to 01

152
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,960
H is just any set it can be 01 to the m

153
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,880
it can be Boolean hyper Cube but it can

154
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,160
be a bigger hyper Cube okay if you're

155
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,240
more comfortable if it's easier for you

156
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,440
to think of H as 01 just think of it as

157
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,400
01 okay so take any function from H to

158
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,039
them to 01 so when I say any function

159
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,639
set of Pol it's just a set of elements

160
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,000
so when I say any function from h of

161
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,599
them to 01 you should think of it as

162
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,759
just an AR arbitrary sequence of H to

163
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:00,039
the m

164
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,759
bits okay and I just ordered them like

165
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,720
in a hyper

166
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,520
Cube okay so I have this sequence of H

167
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,000
to the m bits defined by this function

168
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:14,560
and the theorem says that if you take

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,440
any finite field that contains this set

170
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,080
H so if H let's say is Boolean 01 you

171
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,240
can take any finite field every finite

172
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,800
field contains 01 okay but more

173
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,199
generally any finite field there exists

174
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,160
a unique polinomial so now we move from

175
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:31,360
an arbitrary set of bits

176
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,039
to a

177
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,960
polinomial f from F Tilda so we call it

178
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,680
this is the extension so we call it from

179
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,400
F to F Tilda from F to the m not H to

180
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,479
the m but F to them M so I extended it

181
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,159
to F to the m to

182
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:51,199
F such that if you look at the extended

183
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:54,319
polinomial and the small hyper Cube H to

184
00:07:51,199 --> 00:08:00,080
the m it really is exactly

185
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:04,080
F and this flda has small degrees so its

186
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,120
degree in each variable is H the size of

187
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,800
H minus one okay so if you want to

188
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,520
visualize it here's what you should

189
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,919
think I have a bunch of like uh bits

190
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,599
sitting on some hyper Cube it can be

191
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,879
Boolean or it can be like more you know

192
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,280
elements here but I have arbitrary

193
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:26,440
sequence of bits sitting here in this

194
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:29,720
hyper Cube and the theorem says you can

195
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,680
extend this to like a function over a b

196
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,919
field so over F to the

197
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,360
m in a unique way I know if I specify

198
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,479
it's a unique way in a way that it

199
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,519
extend so on the values here are exactly

200
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,839
as

201
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:49,320
before and the degree of this polinomial

202
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,320
in each variable is exactly H minus

203
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,920
one okay this is the theorem by the way

204
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,680
in the case where H is

205
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,440
01 then the degree in each variable is

206
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,279
one because H minus uh H is 0 one so the

207
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,399
size of it is two degree one this is

208
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:09,200
often called multi-linear extension

209
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,600
because theg the resulting flda is of

210
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,760
degree one in each variable then in

211
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,200
which case it's called

212
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,640
multilinear okay any questions about

213
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,120
what this theorem says the meaning of

214
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,040
this

215
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,279
theorem okay so we're going to prove

216
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,640
this theorem next but and then we're

217
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,079
going to go back to this counting

218
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,399
triangles which was just kind of a

219
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:33,279
motivating example but the what the FOC

220
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:35,279
this is really this theorem and and uh

221
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,079
before I go into the proof I want to say

222
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,480
why this thing is so powerful is that it

223
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,920
allows you to go from an arbitrary

224
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,959
sequence of bits to kind of a polinomial

225
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,000
and which is of low degree and a

226
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,800
polinomial of low degree has a lot of

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
structure and that kind of really helps

228
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,880
us for example once you have polinomial

229
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,720
of low degree with structure of low

230
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,800
degree we can apply subject protocols

231
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,760
okay so that's kind of the way will

232
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,360
offer new subject protocol we're first

233
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,839
going to go to L we have an amatory

234
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,880
sequence we're going to take the low

235
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,880
degree extension and now we can kind of

236
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,640
argue uh you know using use to use we

237
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:15,920
can then use the sum

238
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:18,920
protocol okay uh any questions before

239
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,920
we

240
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,240
yeah

241
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,240
take ariti arithmetization

242
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,160
right so what you're saying is good what

243
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,160
uh let me just repeat what you're saying

244
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,440
uh what you're saying is if F has

245
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,519
already is not arbitrary but actually is

246
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,959
kind of a circuit an arithmetic circuit

247
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,320
with and and or with addition and

248
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,079
multiplication and it's very low depth

249
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:06,360
like log depth let's say or let me call

250
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,360
depth D then just kind of think of it as

251
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,000
over a Big Field especially if it's if

252
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,959
it's Z1 you can think of a big field and

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,079
then the degree of this thing will be

254
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,920
like two to the depth you're right but

255
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:21,720
two to the depth

256
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,040
eh so you're right and so actually for

257
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,399
for Sharp set that's what we did how did

258
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,360
we use the Su check that's exactly what

259
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,399
we did but then you need to assume a lot

260
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,240
of things you need to assume that at

261
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,360
that so you're right if you start with

262
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,040
an F that has structure that it's very

263
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,279
very low depth or like the degree is

264
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,120
very small then you're done you already

265
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:42,000
have it but what this is saying for any

266
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,480
sequence so any sequence of number of

267
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,160
bits can be arbitrary you can kind of

268
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,160
put it in this way

269
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,920
exactly so so what you're saying for the

270
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,760
the the functions that are that are kind

271
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,160
of natively small degree you can

272
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,160
immediately get an extension but the

273
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,920
degree will not be the minimal minimal

274
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,839
degree so to get the minimal

275
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:22,199
degree that's how you do it yeah good

276
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,680
thanks any any other questions okay I

277
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,160
just want to remind you questions are

278
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,680
great I hope you just witness it because

279
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,680
it's good good for people you know for

280
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:35,240
all of you so please ask questions and

281
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:37,680
okay should we dive in okay so the first

282
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,440
thing to notice is

283
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,320
actually you should be familiar with

284
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,399
this theorem for the case where m equals

285
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:52,959
1 so first just notice for M equals

286
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:55,760
1 this theorem is simply known as the um

287
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:59,360
the L interpolation theorem this is

288
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,360
really just l

289
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,680
okay what isolation theorem says just a

290
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,040
recap it says that if you have arbitrary

291
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:19,079
if you have an F exactly the same I'll

292
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,959
just write it from H to

293
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:24,720
01 then there is a unique way of

294
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:30,240
extending it to F to be of degree H

295
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,240
minus one okay so there's a unique

296
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,160
flda from F to

297
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,079
F of

298
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,040
degree H minus one and moreover I'll

299
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:46,560
tell you what it is let me just tell you

300
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,560
what this flda is the

301
00:13:49,639 --> 00:14:00,199
flda is simply sum over all the H's in

302
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:06,360
h uh oh sorry uh f F of

303
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:08,519
H times some polinomial Kai h of

304
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:13,720
X where this

305
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:17,320
polinomial is zero on all the H elements

306
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,920
except for on the specific one okay so

307
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,920
this polinomial

308
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,920
where

309
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:35,920
so this is the F where Kai h of x

310
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,920
is what is one where if

311
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:49,279
uh for every a h Prime in h it's one if

312
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:51,720
H Prime is equal to H and zero

313
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:56,560
otherwise

314
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,560
yes shouldn't it be the inverse

315
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,519
I want the output to be yeah so okay

316
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,120
let's see what I want that if I'm

317
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,440
somewhere in h so I want to say that if

318
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,320
I'm somewhere in h Prime I want to get F

319
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,560
of

320
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:20,000
H I want F Tilda of of uh of so for any

321
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:22,240
H star I want F Tilda of H star to be uh

322
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,800
to be F of H

323
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:29,040
star

324
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:32,040
Z which is either zero or one yeah yeah

325
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,040
so oh

326
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,959
sorry

327
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,639
can what do you mean f of H should be

328
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:48,440
the inverse I'm not sure you're saying

329
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:52,319
here I should have inverse yeah why

330
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,199
so H will you something that's zero okay

331
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,720
so let me try to argue maybe I'm let's

332
00:15:54,199 --> 00:16:01,560
try to do this together so if I have if

333
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,839
this is Kai so I first defined Kai of H

334
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,560
okay that I'm going to Define it in a

335
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,880
second actually I didn't finish defining

336
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,920
it but what's important to me that on

337
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,920
every H Prime in

338
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,399
h it's one if H Prime is equal to H and

339
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,680
zero otherwise suppose I defined it now

340
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:25,240
let's see what I get here I have flda of

341
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,240
H star is Su

342
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:33,120
FH Pi h of H star

343
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:38,040
but this is always zero except it's

344
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:42,319
one when H equals H star so it's always

345
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:45,360
zero except for when H equals H star and

346
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:48,160
when H oh you're saying when H equals H

347
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,160
star then I

348
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,000
have F of

349
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
H

350
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:04,799
star so it this does extend

351
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:07,360
yeah so we're good okay great okay but

352
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,799
let me just mention what is I said this

353
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,360
is the kai but let me actually be

354
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:15,360
explicit so let me erase

355
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,640
this the Kai in the in the Lan

356
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,199
interpolation

357
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,600
theorem it satisfies this but let me

358
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:27,000
actually tell you exactly what it is

359
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:32,280
it's pretty simple it's just sum over H

360
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,720
Prime in H and then it's uh I think H

361
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:39,640
Prime -

362
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,709
x / H oh sorry um

363
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,709
[Music]

364
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:51,160
multiplication H Prime in h minus except

365
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:55,080
for H and it's h Prime minus

366
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,960
H okay so first note this is of degree H

367
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,320
minus

368
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,320
one and when you look at it for any

369
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:08,120
element oh uh yeah for any element H

370
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,799
Prime it's going to be you're going to

371
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,600
it's this is going to cancel out unless

372
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,880
you had you happen to be H oh wait did I

373
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,880
do it

374
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,679
wrong unless you're H and then you're

375
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,720
one good okay so this is just a recap

376
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,360
for L interpolation

377
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,080
okay now let me tell you here in the in

378
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:39,000
so this theorem says the same thing but

379
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:42,320
for M bits for m m variables okay and it

380
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,600
turns out you know how this was flda

381
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,600
here

382
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:50,080
flda of

383
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:54,760
z z now is in F to the

384
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,760
m is very similar it's also

385
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:02,000
sum F of H1 up to hm so for every

386
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:06,200
Point

387
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,480
times this

388
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:16,240
Kai H1 hm of

389
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:19,600
Z and what is this this is one if Z okay

390
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,960
and the small hyper hyper Cube this is

391
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,120
one if the Z is H1 of the HM and is Zer

392
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:30,520
otherwise and it extends so but actually

393
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:35,600
let me be more specific it's really

394
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:38,120
where Kai H1 up to hm of let me call it

395
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:43,280
I know

396
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:49,159
uh X1 up to XM is just the

397
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:50,640
multiplication of k h i x i i goes from

398
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:53,030
one to

399
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,160
n okay so let me move this

400
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,160
[Music]

401
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,840
board okay don't let me erase this board

402
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,760
okay we'll need it okay so again what is

403
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:09,760
the low degree extension flda it's

404
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:13,480
similar to the uh univariate case you

405
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,919
sum over the entire H per Cube and you

406
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,120
multiply by a unique by the degree H

407
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,799
minus one in each variable it's just a

408
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,880
multiplication of all these all of these

409
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:28,760
kaiis that were defined

410
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,559
here okay okay so let's see if if uh let

411
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,320
me try to you know to prove that this

412
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:34,320
works and that it's

413
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:43,200
Unique okay so first what do we need to

414
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:46,400
argue we need to so we have this F telda

415
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,480
now I need to argue that it extends so

416
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,960
the fact so okay so

417
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:56,400
proof so let's first see that for every

418
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,760
H1 star up to hm

419
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,679
star in h to the m

420
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,600
let's look at

421
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:10,240
flda of

422
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:13,000
H hm what is it it's just sum h

423
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:17,320
f of H1 up to

424
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,320
hm times

425
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Kai

426
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:30,120
of so let's look at flda flda on any

427
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,400
point in the per Cube I Define it by

428
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,840
star because it's a specific point and I

429
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,720
just substituted you know I I defined

430
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,520
this F I just substitute Z because this

431
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:44,720
is my Z point and now what do I have I

432
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:49,960
know that this is equal to one if and

433
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:52,760
only if h i star is equal to hi I for

434
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,919
every I because this is how the kai

435
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,200
defined this is just a multiplication of

436
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,120
these

437
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:02,840
K okay so therefore

438
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,400
that's it this is just F of H1 star up

439
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,520
to hm star because the rest of the terms

440
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,000
cancel

441
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,520
done yeah so it

442
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,520
extends how about the

443
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:22,200
degree what's the degree of flda it's

444
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,120
just the degree of these

445
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:29,679
kinds so let's look at degree I of like

446
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:31,960
of a variable I it's the degree I of Kai

447
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,960
of H1

448
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,960
hm

449
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:45,840
and which is what it's just the degree

450
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:51,760
of a single kaihi on x i because this

451
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,760
just uh you can it uh factors

452
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:59,799
to to multiplication kaii and XI so

453
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:04,440
that's just the degree of this which is

454
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:08,159
by what we saw there simply H minus one

455
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,840
done okay so it is indeed it extends F

456
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,720
it's the degree is correct H minus one

457
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,600
in each variable the only thing that I

458
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,600
need to argue is that it's

459
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,640
Unique

460
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,480
questions okay so the uniqueness will

461
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,880
follow from the uniqueness in the

462
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,320
univariate case okay so we already know

463
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,960
from Lan interpolation theorem that in

464
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,360
the univariate case f is

465
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,679
unique now we're going to rely on that

466
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,679
to argue that in the multivariate case f

467
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,279
is

468
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:47,480
unique

469
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:52,880
okay

470
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,880
questions okay so let's do it so

471
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:03,039
uniqueness so suppose for contradiction

472
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,039
that it's not unique okay so suppose for

473
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,960
contradiction that it's n unique so

474
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,559
there exists two ways to extend that

475
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,159
agree on the hyper

476
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:22,640
Cube this means that if you subtract

477
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:24,400
these two you'll get a degree H minus

478
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,000
one polinomial in each variable then in

479
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,080
the hyper cube is zero but it's not zero

480
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,559
because they're two different

481
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,440
different pooms so it means so so uh uh

482
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:37,200
suppose for contradiction let me just

483
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,279
erase this because it's in my way

484
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,399
suppose for contradiction that there

485
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:45,919
exists like a

486
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:49,399
G from F to the m to

487
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,399
F non

488
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,840
zero but G and the hyper

489
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,320
cube is zero that's the contradiction

490
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,320
and of the

491
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,440
degree H minus one in each variable yes

492
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,880
that's a contradiction say Suppose there

493
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,520
this two polinomial that agree on the

494
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,399
hyper cube of this degree we're going to

495
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,799
subtract them we're going to get a

496
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:19,559
single polinomial that's just zero on

497
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:21,039
the hyper Cube because the two agreed

498
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,000
but it's not zero because they were not

499
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,279
the same

500
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,640
polinomial okay what does it mean non

501
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,919
zero okay exist okay what does this mean

502
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,919
of degree and one in each

503
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,799
variable okay the fact that it's non

504
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,559
zero means that there exist some T1 up

505
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,919
to

506
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:44,840
TM in F to the

507
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,240
m such that

508
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:50,039
G and T1 up to

509
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,120
TM is not

510
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:55,399
zero yeah so we're starting with saying

511
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,039
suppose we have G it's not zero but it's

512
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:59,440
zero on the hyper

513
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,720
Cube and going to argue no it can't be

514
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,919
I'm going to find an element in the

515
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,919
hyper Cube for which it's not

516
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,279
zero okay how do I do that what I'm

517
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,600
going to do I'm going to kind of go into

518
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,720
the hyper Cube coordinate by coordinate

519
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,960
kind of by induction okay and here's

520
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,720
what I'm going to do I'm going to say

521
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,720
okay let's look at

522
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,919
G

523
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,919
empty T2 up to

524
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:33,799
TM this is non zero because on T1 it's

525
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:37,200
not zero so this is non

526
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:37,200
zero uh of

527
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,919
degree hus

528
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,880
one but from

529
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:50,360
the langage interpolation

530
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,840
theorem it says that if it's that if

531
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:56,919
it's not zero there must exists

532
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,919
H in small H in h for which it's not

533
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:01,200
zero because if it was Zero on all H

534
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:03,799
there's a unique we extent the zero

535
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,919
polinomial so because the uniqueness of

536
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,919
the L it means that

537
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,120
so from L gr theorem this is just

538
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,679
univariate it means that there must

539
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:23,720
exist

540
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:28,279
H1 such that g of H1 T2 up to TM is non

541
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:31,080
zero again why if so the t's are fixed

542
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:33,000
this is a univ polinomial if it was zero

543
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:37,520
an

544
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:41,120
H then you could extend it to all

545
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:43,600
zeros but there's another way to extend

546
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,440
because uh you know uh the G is not all

547
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,039
zeros that would be a contradiction so

548
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,960
therefore there must exist H1 such that

549
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,399
this is

550
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,120
zero and now we're going to slowly

551
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:59,799
continue in this manner okay now let's

552
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:03,600
look at g h

553
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:03,600
H1 T3 up to

554
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:11,200
TM okay so H1 is fixed in in the small

555
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,320
cube these are fixed in F it's not zero

556
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,840
because on

557
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,679
T2 it's not zero that's what we

558
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:23,720
established so this is non

559
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:27,120
zero of degree H minus one and therefore

560
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,600
somewhere on the small H hyper Cube and

561
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,000
somewhere on H sorry it should be non

562
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:36,480
zero from L interpolation theorem so

563
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
therefore from L interpolation theorem

564
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:44,360
there exist

565
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,360
H2 such that g H1

566
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:53,640
H2 T3 up to TM is non

567
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:57,120
zero and you just continue one by one

568
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,120
until you get that there exists G H1 H2

569
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,559
of to hm

570
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,640
that's not zero and that's a

571
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,320
contradiction because we assumed it is

572
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,559
zero everywhere and the small hyper

573
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,960
hyper

574
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:13,080
CU yeah okay so in the notes I I have

575
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,760
like the reduction I I can there's a

576
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,399
proof that kind of by induction very

577
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,360
formal but I think this is good enough

578
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,559
for for for class otherwise it's going

579
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:23,360
to be a bit boring questions yes can you

580
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:28,159
also just a Ching argument like you can

581
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:30,000
just count how many po of degre

582
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,320
raise it up until like all the term

583
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,159
that's

584
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,519
number okay good good good so you're

585
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:36,080
saying maybe you can also prove it using

586
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:37,640
just counting angre me say if there's

587
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,159
too many then like you'll have too many

588
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,760
pooms and that's a contradiction because

589
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:42,679
the number of polinomial like the number

590
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:46,760
of coefficients probably you can do

591
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:46,760
something like that as well

592
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,679
uh yeah yeah can I try to make thee for

593
00:29:52,080 --> 00:30:00,039
the ared yes please good good

594
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,039
good the aration

595
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,559
can

596
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,080
yeah

597
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:16,320
good at the good very good okay so what

598
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,080
you're saying is you're saying look once

599
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,120
you force me once you don't you're I I

600
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,480
said I'm look at me I don't assume

601
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,480
anything about F you assume no degree

602
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,000
look at me I assume nothing and look

603
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,519
what I get now you're saying well you

604
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,640
assume nothing but you know you don't

605
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,679
get that much either because this F

606
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,720
Tilda is so inefficient note to compute

607
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,760
this F Tilda where is

608
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,120
it it takes time H to them you need to

609
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,559
sum over all the hyper Cube so Computing

610
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:49,000
flda is really inefficient whereas your

611
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:51,120
FTI is so efficient in ice 100% yes

612
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,360
you're

613
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,320
right I'll give it to you V not yeah no

614
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,320
but this will be useful in settings that

615
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,360
the arithmetization

616
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,880
but but that's a good point thanks is

617
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,880
like easy way to

618
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:13,159
number

619
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:15,120
that many okay so if okay so the

620
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:16,519
question is can we bound essentially

621
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,639
asking well can we make this after a

622
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:22,720
little more efficient maybe kind of so

623
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:24,080
in general we cannot because in general

624
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,600
it depends what you want to assume about

625
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,200
the F so I'm saying I don't want to make

626
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,960
any assumptions about the and as you

627
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,039
will see it's not just because I'm kind

628
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,279
of I want to just be as general as

629
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,960
general as possible for the sake of

630
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:39,360
generality actually in the way we use it

631
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,039
it's really has no structure uh the the

632
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,679
F we use is kind of very

633
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:46,080
arbitrary uh so we can't assume that it

634
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,720
comes from a low degree whatever nothing

635
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,519
uh and in that case if you want to allow

636
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,840
any NF then you have to have all the

637
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,840
monomials because there's just by a

638
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,120
counting argument if you the number of

639
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,919
FS is like you know all the uh all the

640
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,279
possible H to the n Bits so you have to

641
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,679
have that many monomials otherwise where

642
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:07,480
would you store that information so in

643
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:11,600
general you can't do with L monomials

644
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:13,279
however in many cases you can do and

645
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,639
actually even will use it the fact that

646
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:19,000
in some cases you can do with L

647
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:21,639
monomials so we'll see that but that

648
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,480
that's that's great great

649
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:26,519
Point any any other

650
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,480
questions so let me just tell you this

651
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:31,519
is a very good to stop and ask questions

652
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,399
because it's really will'll get back to

653
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:35,639
this so much and even if not in this

654
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:37,919
class you'll see it and it will come

655
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:42,000
come at you uh it's a really really

656
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,000
important and uh fundamental

657
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,559
theorem okay so I guess next I'm going

658
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:52,440
to try to convince you why it is such an

659
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:56,240
important fundamental theorem and I'm

660
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,159
going to start with a uh just kind of

661
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,120
looking back at the example of doubly

662
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,760
efficient interactive proofs for

663
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,799
counting

664
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,559
triangles just as a motivating example

665
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,840
uh we'll do it quick and then we'll go

666
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,880
into kind of I think the um more kind of

667
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,039
interesting and general way of using

668
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,240
this low degree extension together with

669
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:19,720
a sum check to get doubly efficient

670
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,399
proofs for any low depth computation so

671
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,519
kind of arbitrary computations so we'll

672
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:27,000
see that next but let's first kind of as

673
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,720
a warmup look at uh the example for

674
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,760
counting triangles why is this low

675
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,880
degree extension with some check how can

676
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:37,000
we use these together to count triangles

677
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,320
in a graph so now note what's the goal

678
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,080
we have a graph I want to know how many

679
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,080
triangles there are in the graph now

680
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,200
it's not that hard it takes time n to

681
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,960
the third I go over every three pair of

682
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,799
vertices and check if there's a triangle

683
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,880
so I have an end to the N cubed

684
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,279
algorithm but let's say the verifier

685
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,399
can't run in time n Cub the poor guy he

686
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,799
gets the graph so size n squar all he

687
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,519
can do is run time n squ essentially a

688
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,440
polylog with some polog overhead but

689
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,720
only N squared so he can't count so now

690
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,200
what is he

691
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:11,720
do he needs help okay now I'll show you

692
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,560
how the pr can help him in a way that

693
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:18,280
now yes he only needs to run in time n

694
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:22,359
squ or o till of n squ okay so let's

695
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:25,359
look at that example um so let me erase

696
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:25,359
this

697
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,480
so here's an example where this is

698
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,240
useful we're given a

699
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,679
graph and the goal we want a protocol a

700
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,839
proof where the Prov will convince to

701
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:55,119
the verifier that the

702
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:55,119
number of triangles

703
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:05,640
in G is let's say some number

704
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:08,160
beta I want to prove for this

705
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,520
fact how will I Pro how so I'm going to

706
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,000
prove to you you guys are time o of n

707
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:14,520
squ you can only read the graph I'm

708
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,359
going to help

709
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,680
you prove to you that the number of

710
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:24,240
triangles exactly beta while uh you uh

711
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:26,560
just uh run time n s how do I do that

712
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:33,400
I'm going to let's look at the function

713
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:39,280
f from so suppose V is n okay so I look

714
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:43,040
at the function from 01 2 log n to

715
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,520
01 and this just tells me whether so 01

716
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,960
so it's like 0 one to the log it's you

717
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:52,040
can think of this as being kind of n

718
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,200
byn so it takes log n Bits that describe

719
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,160
one VAR one vertex log and bit to

720
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,359
describe another vertex and it outputs

721
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,760
one if and only if there's an edge

722
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:02,760
okay so you can think of each so

723
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:13,119
F takes two vertices I and J and outputs

724
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,119
one if there's an

725
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:20,440
edge and zero otherwise so f is just the

726
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,440
adjacency Matrix the adjacent Matrix is

727
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,800
you know n squ Bits this is unquit I

728
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,119
just put it and Define it this way okay

729
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,560
so again F takes two vertices

730
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,400
it outputs one if there's an edge

731
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:35,680
between these

732
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,680
vertices okay

733
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:43,319
now we okay so what do we need so okay

734
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:47,560
now what do we know we know that this

735
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:47,560
F has a low degree

736
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,760
extension so this is of

737
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:01,680
degree essentially this is multi linear

738
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,000
CU I started with 0 one so this is so f

739
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,160
is

740
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,480
multilinear so degree one in each

741
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,800
variable now why do I want why am I

742
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,920
looking at these ad adjacency Matrix

743
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,359
what do I want what do I want to prove

744
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,599
how does this relate to the number of

745
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,960
triangles so the number of triangles we

746
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,400
started discussing this last time is

747
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,319
just the

748
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:31,440
sum over all kind of triangles I J K oh

749
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:37,079
sorry all kind of three nodes i j k and

750
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:39,839
V and it's a triangle if what if f i j

751
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,839
is one and

752
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,599
f j

753
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:49,960
k is one and f i k is

754
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:53,359
one so I want to know how many

755
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,319
triplets is this thing one if an edge is

756
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,359
missing in one of them then this is

757
00:37:55,319 --> 00:38:00,839
going to be zero because I multiplied

758
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,839
so I want to know how many of them do I

759
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:04,599
have

760
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,240
one okay and that's almost the number of

761
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:09,880
triangle except that I need to divide by

762
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:12,800
six because I counted each triangle each

763
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,240
three vertices all the permutations so

764
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,960
so that's what the Prov wants to prove

765
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,200
to the

766
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:22,720
verifier okay so let me I said V but let

767
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,119
me call it 01 to the N to the log

768
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,960
n is the

769
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,800
same now I'm done

770
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,400
why am I done cuz I'm saying you know

771
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,520
what so how do I prove this I'm going to

772
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,760
use the Su check but you're saying wait

773
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,400
but this is not a polinomial no worries

774
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,599
here you

775
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,920
go now it's a polinomial now I didn't

776
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:47,359
change anything because it's only over

777
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,640
the small cube so the fact that I extend

778
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,000
it doesn't change that doesn't change

779
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,680
the

780
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,960
sum okay because of the

781
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:00,680
extension so the prover needs to prove

782
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,560
that the sum of this polinomial so

783
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,079
before it was multilinear now it's

784
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,640
degree two because you know each

785
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,400
variable we multiply three pooms each

786
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,960
one appears in Two Fine degree two in

787
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:15,319
each variable and we need to

788
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:19,560
prove that the sum is

789
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:21,640
beta this is exactly what some is for

790
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,359
precisely okay and note what does the

791
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,480
prover so now so what are we're going to

792
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:27,119
do we're going to do subject protocol

793
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,160
what is the runtime of the verifier and

794
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,520
the protocol so they interact you know

795
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,599
we do every time you get rid of one

796
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,359
variable one by one by one at the end

797
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:39,599
the verifier needs to

798
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:41,880
compute F these kind of this Pol the

799
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,760
final polinomial which in our case is

800
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,160
this entire

801
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,520
polinomial and a single point in the

802
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,599
extension namely he needs to compute F

803
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:53,200
Tilda on a random point in F in I guess

804
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,640
F

805
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,040
squ three

806
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:01,280
times but that he can do do very very

807
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:04,280
easily or what I mean in time N squared

808
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,400
because what is f Tilda F Tilda I mean

809
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:11,359
as as VOD said enumerate over all the

810
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,960
small cube lot but here the small cube

811
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,839
is n squ so really takes time n squ

812
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,119
three so order of n can do this three

813
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:21,960
times he needs to compute this this but

814
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,640
this is poly log so by the way

815
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,960
throughout this I mentioned it last time

816
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:29,480
but I'll mention again throughout this

817
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:31,079
course I the polog factors I'm not even

818
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,359
you know these are all like you can put

819
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:34,880
things like in

820
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:38,160
tildas I'm kind of eating I I don't want

821
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,160
to pay attention too much the polylog

822
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,560
factors okay so really what he work what

823
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,319
the runtime of the verifier is just n

824
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,000
squ the the communication complexity is

825
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:52,599
nothing M number of variables is order

826
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,920
log n d the dep the degree is constant

827
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:57,839
uh log F well don't take F to be too

828
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,720
long too big take F you know so that log

829
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,839
f is not is

830
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,560
small and and note even the prover

831
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:07,480
doesn't run in too long what's the

832
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,440
runtime of the prover it's in the sum

833
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:12,760
check protocol it's m the number of

834
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:16,240
variables log n uh times H to the N now

835
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:19,160
H to the N seems big but again it's n s

836
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,839
times the time it takes to compute F1

837
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,680
which is again uh n squ so he's

838
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:28,480
polinomial and now the verifier runs in

839
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,480
time uh squared

840
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,920
okay so that's just kind of to

841
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:39,240
illustrate yeah to

842
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,440
be yeah he he right and he is he's

843
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:44,079
actually n he's n to the fourth in this

844
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,920
example because he

845
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,400
runs he needs to compute this okay let's

846
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,640
see he's more actually he needs to

847
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:56,040
compute this thing so he needs to do it

848
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:57,680
for every I JK in right so and it's wor

849
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,480
yeah he need to not just a compute to do

850
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,680
the entire sum check so in the sum check

851
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,079
it's he needs to kind of H to the m

852
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:10,680
which is M here is going to be 3 log n

853
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:12,880
so uh in this so it's like uh already n

854
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,119
cubed and then he needs to compute T of

855
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,599
f like the polinomial which is n s so

856
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:21,880
he's n the 5ifth because Computing this

857
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:23,960
once is n squ without the sum but he

858
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:26,920
also needs to do run over all the

859
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,599
sum and then also log factors yeah he's

860
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,960
he's he's he's running more but po it's

861
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,559
it's considered still doubly efficient

862
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,040
because he still polinomial

863
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:37,040
overhead yeah if

864
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:47,599
no yeah even in Cube you're saying you

865
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:50,800
for yeah currently it's a good so okay n

866
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,680
Cub you can get it uh using a recent

867
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,680
kind of really nice Works uh you with

868
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,240
just optimizing a little bit uh that's

869
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,920
the work of uh Dan song and friends they

870
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:04,559
get a linear time so they can get an N

871
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,040
cubed I don't know how to it's but it

872
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:07,440
may be that for this specific protocol

873
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,160
it's possible actually I don't know it's

874
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,359
a good

875
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:16,520
question but let me actually before you

876
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:16,520
get too excited about it so uh

877
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,200
yeah the number of rounds is

878
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:28,680
login great great question have a two

879
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:31,280
message so when I finished where's Gabe

880
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:33,480
oh hi so you came to me last time right

881
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,680
so uh when I started talking about this

882
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:38,440
last lecture gab came to me rightly so

883
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,079
and said well uh we just started talking

884
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,440
about it right he's like well okay but

885
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:46,960
uh you can do it so much easier and it's

886
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,680
true I this was kind of to as a an

887
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,240
example to you know to show but actually

888
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,760
going since you asked the question also

889
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,040
actually there's a very much simpler

890
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,040
protocol that gave notice so let me let

891
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,040
me just write it here

892
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,920
the idea is that the prover will only

893
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,319
send two matrices over so it's it's a

894
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,480
big communication complexity here the

895
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,160
communication complexity is po long but

896
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,880
if we just care about verifier runtime

897
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,680
and we don't care about the

898
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:17,520
communication complexity then the prover

899
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,559
can just send the verifier the m so

900
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,680
think of let let a be the adjacency

901
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,839
Matrix let me now instead of f write it

902
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,280
in the more classical notation of a

903
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:29,240
matrix a The adjacency Matrix where

904
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,520
there's an edge if there's a one if if

905
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:35,920
and only if there's an edge and zero

906
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:38,160
otherwise the pr will send the Matrix A2

907
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,359
is a

908
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,200
squ a he can also send a but the

909
00:44:40,359 --> 00:44:46,559
verifier knows a and

910
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,599
A3 which is a

911
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:51,760
cubed now the N now the number of

912
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:55,480
triangles is just the

913
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,599
trace of a cubed so it's very easy to

914
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,160
compute you just compute now how do you

915
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,599
know that that this is a squar and this

916
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,720
is a cubed well we saw last time a

917
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,319
protocol a randomized protocol for

918
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:11,200
checking equality between matrices via

919
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:14,359
kind of this uh re Solomon kind of

920
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:17,040
decoding idea so you do that so there

921
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:21,960
you go that's really really

922
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,480
nice well but then blame blame Gabe of

923
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,079
course

924
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:29,800
exactly you're right

925
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:29,800
okay

926
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:38,280
um you can

927
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,280
get

928
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:46,480
okay I need to so you you know there's a

929
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:50,079
really beautiful work of rrr uh and they

930
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,839
get conent round complexity uh and so

931
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,480
using their paral probably you can get

932
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:55,640
very good but I need to think about the

933
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:58,760
parameters I think you can get in con

934
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:01,319
around like probably like really good

935
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,599
parameters but I'm I need to think about

936
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:04,640
the

937
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:08,480
details

938
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,559
yeah okay H so so this was just a

939
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,119
motivating example to show you that you

940
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,079
can take something also with no

941
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:17,040
structure whatsoever like adjacency

942
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:19,800
matrix it's no structure it's arbitrary

943
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,280
but using the technique of a low deegree

944
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:26,920
extension you can kind of add structure

945
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,920
to it and then you can use the sum check

946
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:34,760
okay so um more generally I want to say

947
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:37,280
I think what's really the power of this

948
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,720
is you know in eror correcting codes

949
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,240
what's nice about err correcting codes

950
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,440
is if you cheat you kind of need to

951
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,160
cheat everywhere in a sense things kind

952
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,640
of

953
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:50,400
percolate in proof system this kind of

954
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:53,280
thing is very very useful because we

955
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,839
want to proof system is about catching

956
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,760
cheaters you want to C when we construct

957
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:01,240
like interactive proof our goal is to

958
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,920
catch aover uh a cheating prover and so

959
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,440
you want some encoding kind of you want

960
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,640
to say if he cheat somewhere he has to

961
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,319
cheat everywhere kind of that so this

962
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:13,920
idea of kind of having in some sense you

963
00:47:11,319 --> 00:47:15,839
want kind of a if you want the proof to

964
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,119
you want

965
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:21,440
um it's very natural that kind of some

966
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,400
encoding comes into proof systems and

967
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,200
we'll see that next when we look at the

968
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:28,000
gkr protocol for uh low depth

969
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,839
computation

970
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,160
okay so that's coming next now before I

971
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:35,920
start this protocol I have a question

972
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,760
for you so last time this is a long

973
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,680
class this a three-hour class it's

974
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:44,760
tiring so uh and it's technical which is

975
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,640
even more tiring so now I want to ask

976
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,240
you two options option one we'll take

977
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:52,440
two breaks one after one hour one after

978
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:54,440
the second hour it will give you kind of

979
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:57,720
or we take one in the middle which is

980
00:47:54,440 --> 00:48:00,200
maybe a little longer any H how many

981
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,800
people are for like two kind of short

982
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,000
breaks to

983
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,880
decompose let's take a break now for

984
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,880
five minutes and then we'll do

985
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:17,240
gkr okay so so so far when the

986
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:18,960
applications we saw a for the G for the

987
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,640
sum check and even if you want the low

988
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,079
degree extension were both kind of

989
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:27,160
counting you know we said okay let's

990
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:30,040
count uh the sharp set let's let's count

991
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,760
the number of triangles so you may think

992
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,200
okay well some check is about counting

993
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,760
so yeah I can see how you can do

994
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,240
counting Problems by either they're

995
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,200
already kind of low degree and you just

996
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,599
apply some check automatically or

997
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,640
they're not low degree and then you do

998
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,200
low degree extension and now you have

999
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:49,000
the Su check okay so maybe you can do

1000
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,040
kind of counting things but that's it so

1001
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,359
now the what I want to show you next is

1002
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,559
that no actually you can do a ton with

1003
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:58,240
that so just the low degree extension

1004
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:59,480
and some together that's all you need

1005
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,559
and what I'm going to show you now is

1006
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:05,839
how to do an a doubly efficient

1007
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:09,200
interactive proof for all low depth

1008
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:11,400
circuits so let me explain uh so suppose

1009
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:16,079
you have here some

1010
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:18,520
circuit C it's really really big uh but

1011
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:23,599
it's shallow okay so think of this

1012
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:26,599
circuit size s which is really big the

1013
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,599
depth

1014
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:33,240
is D which is very

1015
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:35,079
small okay now what I'm going to show

1016
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:38,799
you is a doubly efficient interactive

1017
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:43,799
proof where the verifier runs in time

1018
00:49:38,799 --> 00:49:44,559
only D or linear in D or D and poly log

1019
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:47,200
in

1020
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,200
s and and the prover of course he needs

1021
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:51,640
to compute the circuit he runs in Time s

1022
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,440
he has to run the computation and only

1023
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,440
poly overhead so poly ofs okay so I'm

1024
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,559
going to show you w efficient

1025
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,200
interactive proof for any bounded depth

1026
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:00,920
yes can just clarify here circuit size

1027
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,319
is just number of gates good the circuit

1028
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:08,359
size just number of gates yeah yeah now

1029
00:50:05,319 --> 00:50:11,119
note I I'm this already seems like weird

1030
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:12,760
because okay so the pro I said the goal

1031
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,400
is the prover is going to convince the

1032
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,160
verifier that let's say so the goal is

1033
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,160
to convince the

1034
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:26,440
verifier that c of x equals let's say

1035
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,440
one

1036
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:33,079
think of is any any Boolean Circuit of

1037
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,319
small depth so now but but and the

1038
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:37,520
verifier should be very efficient but

1039
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:39,040
now you're saying just reading C is not

1040
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,079
efficient if you have an arbitrary

1041
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,040
circuit just reading the circuit is not

1042
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:46,559
efficient you're right so for this to be

1043
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:48,440
meaningful C needs to have a succinct

1044
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,280
representation so it needs to be kind of

1045
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:53,319
a uniform circuit that you can specified

1046
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:58,640
succinctly and indeed we will assume

1047
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:58,640
that c is what's called log space

1048
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,640
uniform which essentially means that

1049
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:13,520
there's a log space machine a log s

1050
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:16,160
space machine that uh um a uniform

1051
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:19,640
turing machine that generates this

1052
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,480
circuit but actually for now don't think

1053
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:22,839
about just suppose it's it's it's just

1054
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,720
kind of there's some uniform condition

1055
00:51:22,839 --> 00:51:26,640
okay so the verifier has sucing

1056
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,599
representation of the C because it will

1057
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,359
only come much much later when you'll

1058
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:32,280
see this kind of you'll need to deal

1059
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:36,040
with this issue

1060
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:38,920
okay so so the goal is for the prover to

1061
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:41,720
prove to the verifier that C ofx equals

1062
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:44,960
1 and the idea the way we're going to do

1063
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:47,559
this essentially is the high level idea

1064
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:50,599
is we're GNA kind of so the

1065
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:52,319
PO so I I want to prove I want to kind

1066
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:53,480
of catch the pro if he's cheating how am

1067
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:55,480
I going to catch him I want to make sure

1068
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,400
he's correct so the per comes to me and

1069
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:02,280
says look see x equal 1 the value here

1070
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:04,720
is one I want to reduce the claim on the

1071
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:08,000
output value to a claim about something

1072
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,160
in one layer below and then by like the

1073
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,400
small sub protocol and then I want to

1074
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,319
reduce the claim about something about

1075
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,599
kind of layer below layer below and

1076
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:18,040
layer below and layer below and layer

1077
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:19,760
below and so on until I get a claim

1078
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,960
about the input which the verifier can

1079
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,400
compute on its own that's kind of the

1080
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,839
idea so for this the first thing we

1081
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,520
assume and this is without lots of

1082
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,520
generality

1083
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,160
that c is

1084
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:36,559
layered what do I mean by layered

1085
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,119
there's an output gate there's kind of

1086
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:41,520
that's let's call it layer zero and then

1087
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:44,280
you go to gate and then it there's kind

1088
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,480
of a wires to one layer below we'll call

1089
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,240
it layer one and then their gates to one

1090
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,200
layer below we'll call the layer two so

1091
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,040
it's not there's no kind of Long Gate

1092
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,880
that go from the input straight to kind

1093
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:56,559
of it's really layer by layer okay so

1094
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,520
that's the first assumption so we can

1095
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,440
talk about layer so that what it means

1096
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:04,000
is that

1097
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,000
gate in layer

1098
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,200
I is

1099
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:16,839
connected

1100
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:20,119
only to

1101
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:20,119
Gates in

1102
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:28,240
layer uh I + one where we think of I

1103
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,240
equals z is output

1104
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:35,760
and I D is input

1105
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,599
layer okay so this is just for the sake

1106
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,559
of Simplicity you can always kind of uh

1107
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:48,720
add dummy gates to make sure uh that

1108
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:51,240
each gate is only connected to one layer

1109
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,160
below if before was connected to someone

1110
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:57,559
closer to the input you just add dummy

1111
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:00,359
gates to kind of go up up up

1112
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:03,799
okay so again let me just make sure

1113
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:05,319
everyone's on board but by layer when I

1114
00:54:03,799 --> 00:54:08,599
say gate is in layer I essentially what

1115
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:10,280
I mean the depth from there to the input

1116
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:14,240
the number the path the length of the

1117
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:16,640
path is I so any gate that is kind of I

1118
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,200
away from the input it's connected to

1119
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,119
Gates that are only I minus one away

1120
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,319
from the

1121
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:23,119
input okay so we assum that's an

1122
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:25,680
assumption I'm going to make and the way

1123
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,480
I can get I can realize it is by just if

1124
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,359
this original circuit was not in this

1125
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,599
way I'm just going to add dummy gates in

1126
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:33,400
the middle so if a circuit at layer

1127
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,119
three was connected immediately to the

1128
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,640
input I'm going to just copy the input

1129
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:40,160
in one two and then I'm going to kind of

1130
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,559
ATT uh connect it so things are going to

1131
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,359
be

1132
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:47,440
layered questions about this

1133
00:54:44,359 --> 00:54:50,200
assumption okay so now the the uh

1134
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,400
circuit is layered and now what I want

1135
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,000
to do I want to reduce so now I'm going

1136
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,000
to have an interactive protocol so the

1137
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
idea

1138
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:02,319
in G is to have uh an

1139
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,240
interactive

1140
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:12,040
protocol that consists of D

1141
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:29,520
subprotocol and each subprotocol

1142
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:32,960
essentially reduces a claim about some

1143
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,680
layer I to a claim about layer i+ one so

1144
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,839
a claim about the layer that's one

1145
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,079
closer to the

1146
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:41,960
input okay so these are kind of how

1147
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:43,760
these sub protocols uh will go I'm going

1148
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:47,799
to explain I'm going to explain the GK

1149
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:50,720
protocol formally but this is just uh

1150
00:55:47,799 --> 00:55:57,799
intuition uh and

1151
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:57,799
uh okay so uh let me take this actually

1152
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:11,000
so the first thing is

1153
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:14,760
uh okay

1154
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,440
so here is here is kind of the

1155
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,839
idea so again I'm this is not the

1156
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,880
protocol this is I'm kind of giving an

1157
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:24,680
intuition of kind of what helping you

1158
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,039
kind of understand where I'm going to go

1159
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,799
so we want to prove

1160
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:31,319
a cheating prover suppose he's cheating

1161
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:34,200
he's trying to argue that t ofx equals

1162
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:36,079
one but think of it it's not we want to

1163
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,920
catch him how do we catch him if it's if

1164
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:41,480
he's cheating how do we catch him so one

1165
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:44,160
idea is to say well if he's cheating

1166
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,680
here he must so let's say this is an and

1167
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:49,480
gate suppose it's zero but he's claiming

1168
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,760
it's one so it means that I'm going to

1169
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,400
ask him you know

1170
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:55,760
what it can't be if I tell him give me

1171
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,839
both of these he also must be cheating

1172
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,319
so I'm going tell him you know what

1173
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:01,200
really this is one so in that case you

1174
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:04,039
claim that both of these are one he's

1175
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,319
like yeah or if it was an or I'm saying

1176
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:09,280
oh this one so you come that one of them

1177
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:11,760
is in a right he's like yeah so but but

1178
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,160
in reality they're both zero so now what

1179
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,720
I can say you know what okay fine I'm

1180
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:18,280
going to choose one of them at random

1181
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:21,760
really okay told me that this is a a one

1182
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:24,039
so I'm going to he he's by by by

1183
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,760
cheating one of them one of these have

1184
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:30,720
to be a cheat so I'm going to Pro really

1185
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:32,200
so show me you know show me this and

1186
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,880
then I'll go down show me show me show

1187
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:36,280
me show me and at the end he's stuck cuz

1188
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:38,079
it's an input so this is a very easy

1189
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,799
approach the problem with this approach

1190
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,920
I lose probility half in each layer okay

1191
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:44,119
because

1192
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:48,319
suppose uh if it's an and let's say it's

1193
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:52,000
a zero then he tells me oh uh one of

1194
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:54,240
them is zeros but in reality I know

1195
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,240
they're both one so I'm going to tell

1196
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,559
them oh really both of them are zero

1197
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,400
fine I'll choose one of them okay show

1198
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,720
me this is zero but maybe this really

1199
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:05,680
was the zero one and then he'll of

1200
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:07,400
course cheat so I'm my finger cross this

1201
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,160
was actually a one but only was

1202
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,920
probability half and then every so okay

1203
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,640
so that idea works very well it's just

1204
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,839
the sound this is one over two to the D

1205
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,720
so that's not good because one over two

1206
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:21,720
to the D is like the size of the circuit

1207
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:25,039
I need to that sucks okay no

1208
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:27,799
good so what do we do so here's the

1209
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:30,640
basic idea the idea say you know what

1210
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:33,160
don't ask pergate per gate that's not a

1211
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:36,599
good idea let's ask something about kind

1212
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:38,480
of an encoding of the entire layer so

1213
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:40,160
instead I'm going to have to give me

1214
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:43,400
something kind of about the low degree

1215
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:45,760
extension of this uh layer so I'm not

1216
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:49,240
going to ask reducer tell me this tell

1217
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:51,760
me this no tell me something about

1218
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:55,480
this and then I'm going to argue if he

1219
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:57,280
cheated here he must also cheat here

1220
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:59,680
with very high

1221
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,799
probability and now and then and and

1222
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,319
again if he cheat here I'm going to

1223
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:06,760
argue that he must cheat here with very

1224
00:59:03,319 --> 00:59:08,079
high probability and so on so forth but

1225
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:10,599
now that that's kind of the high level

1226
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:13,480
idea but now you can say whoa this is a

1227
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:15,319
bit confusing before when I said oh if

1228
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,280
he cheated here I'm going to ask him

1229
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:20,119
open like cheat on one of these it's

1230
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:22,280
very easy for me to check if you say is

1231
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:25,599
this is zero and it's an end you're

1232
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:28,599
claiming that one of this is zero but I

1233
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:32,000
know one this is one so it's very easy

1234
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:34,720
to argue how do I go so I I can just say

1235
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,760
Okay prove to me that you know this is a

1236
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:40,359
zero or Pro that's easy how do I go from

1237
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:43,520
arguing about the low degree

1238
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:46,359
extension of an element of of of a layer

1239
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:49,240
to low degree extension of another layer

1240
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:52,079
what do I ask you

1241
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:55,559
even and it turns out that what I do

1242
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,720
here is really low deegree extension and

1243
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:58,960
some check

1244
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:01,920
so I go from here to here it's just a

1245
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,599
sum check so that's what we're going to

1246
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:06,880
see

1247
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:09,000
okay that's kind of the high level idea

1248
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,000
any any

1249
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,720
questions let me just make sure I didn't

1250
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,720
forget to say

1251
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:21,720
something okay good what's theal for the

1252
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:25,000
ver good okay what we're going to get

1253
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:28,520
okay goal as efficient as possible what

1254
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:31,079
we get is the verifier runtime and the

1255
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:34,359
communication complexity will be like d

1256
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:37,079
the depth times polylog the circuit size

1257
01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:39,799
and the reason we we PID this depth is

1258
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:42,400
because in the protocol we're going to

1259
01:00:39,799 --> 01:00:46,640
run D subprotocols we're going to kind

1260
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:49,960
of go from a claim on layer I to another

1261
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:53,680
claim of layer I and each kind of

1262
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:55,119
reduction uh in in the in in the layers

1263
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,280
is going to be kind of a subject

1264
01:00:55,119 --> 01:01:01,920
protocol which which will consist of log

1265
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:04,640
s rounds or log s it's uh the the M the

1266
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,599
a uh the variable is going to be log s

1267
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,079
So eventually the runtime of the pro of

1268
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:11,960
the verifier will be something like the

1269
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:13,520
depth Times log the circuit size and the

1270
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,920
ver the pro is going to run time poly in

1271
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,920
the circuit size but we we'll we'll go

1272
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,520
over all these parameters uh once we see

1273
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:20,680
the protocol but that's what you should

1274
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,039
that that's kind of the theorem that

1275
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:27,400
we'll write when we get there great

1276
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:29,280
thanks any any other questions yes so

1277
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,960
the verifier isn't able to see the whole

1278
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:34,839
circuit right like how did the verifier

1279
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:36,520
get good good good good good so the

1280
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:38,559
verify as I said he doesn't even he

1281
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,119
can't even see the entire circuit all he

1282
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:43,880
has is like some uniform TR machine that

1283
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:46,799
generates the circuit so that's a very

1284
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:49,359
good question how does how does

1285
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:52,039
he we'll see it's actually it's compli

1286
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:55,480
the answer is it's complicated but we'll

1287
01:01:52,039 --> 01:01:58,599
see we'll see as as we go along a he'll

1288
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:00,680
use his kind of uniform access to to to

1289
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:01,520
help him out it's really unclear how at

1290
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:05,520
this

1291
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:08,720
point great okay so what do we do so

1292
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:10,079
first thing is uh so step one this is

1293
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:13,079
just again for

1294
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,079
Simplicity

1295
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:16,940
[Music]

1296
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:24,319
arithmetization so ariti all I mean here

1297
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:26,720
is convert an or to kind of convert an

1298
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:30,119
an to multiplication convert or into the

1299
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:33,240
sum minus multiplication just convert

1300
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:36,640
the the the or and an or Gates into

1301
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:38,920
addition and multiplication gate okay so

1302
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,920
step

1303
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:43,160
one arithmetization

1304
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:01,559
add and Mt

1305
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:08,799
Gates now you're right at this point the

1306
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:10,880
verifier doesn't even know he so we'll

1307
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:13,640
talk about how the verifier has access

1308
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,599
to these things later okay but like the

1309
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:18,240
prover what he does at least okay the

1310
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,240
prover first

1311
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:27,039
arithmetization Gates and and Gat and

1312
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:28,839
and addition Gates good now what he does

1313
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:30,799
so he wants to I want to convince you

1314
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:35,240
that c of X we said one so I'll make it

1315
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:36,319
one what do I do I I'm the prover I take

1316
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:40,440
my input

1317
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:42,400
x i compute the values of all the gates

1318
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:44,760
in the circuit okay so what does the

1319
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,760
prover

1320
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,720
do first

1321
01:03:49,799 --> 01:03:53,039
compute the

1322
01:03:53,279 --> 01:03:57,720
values of all the gates

1323
01:03:59,079 --> 01:04:04,160
of

1324
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:06,760
C okay so now the prover computed all

1325
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:09,480
these uh bits which are the values of

1326
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:11,799
the gates note this is this is still

1327
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:15,240
over just it's Boolean it's over kind of

1328
01:04:11,799 --> 01:04:21,760
gf2 yeah it's a everything is

1329
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:24,119
zero1 okay next thing uh I do is I um

1330
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:28,799
the prover does he computes the low

1331
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:30,400
degree extension of each layer okay what

1332
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:33,279
how so what are the parameters what how

1333
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:37,720
do we do it there's many ways to do it

1334
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:39,640
the one so so let's think of let me add

1335
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:42,480
actually another assumption just for

1336
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:46,599
Simplicity let's assume that the number

1337
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:48,240
of gates in each layer is exactly s like

1338
01:04:46,599 --> 01:04:49,760
the size of the circuit I'm just

1339
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:51,480
assuming that so I don't need to know

1340
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,760
have different SES it's just going to be

1341
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:55,799
annoying why can I assume that the

1342
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,000
number of gates in each layer is exactly

1343
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:59,799
s just add them get are just zero

1344
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,839
nobody's going to look at them okay I'm

1345
01:04:59,799 --> 01:05:04,240
just kind of want it'll just make my

1346
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:08,279
notations easy okay so now if there's

1347
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:10,119
less just add zeros z z z zero so now

1348
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:11,720
it's like this kind of circuit by just

1349
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:15,480
adding zeros

1350
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:20,760
everywhere okay good now what does the

1351
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:20,760
prover do he thinks so now each each

1352
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:26,559
layer consists

1353
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,400
of s

1354
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:34,279
values that's the Assumption it's that

1355
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,799
we added demig Gates so now we have S

1356
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:38,760
values per layer okay many of them can

1357
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:43,920
be zero if the G if the layer was short

1358
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:46,039
but there's s uh values so let's write

1359
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:49,319
these Val so let's write these values

1360
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:52,000
for this is for layer I let's write

1361
01:05:49,319 --> 01:05:54,640
these values in a hyper Cube okay so

1362
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,839
let's write these values as kind of a

1363
01:05:54,640 --> 01:06:01,319
function from h to the m to

1364
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:01,319
01 where

1365
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:09,119
H to the m is exactly

1366
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:11,119
s so we said each layer has s elements

1367
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,960
write them in some H hyper Cube where

1368
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:14,279
the size of the hyper cube is exactly s

1369
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,799
so you can write all these elements in

1370
01:06:14,279 --> 01:06:19,000
the hyper cube in some order that makes

1371
01:06:15,799 --> 01:06:22,000
sense to you okay so if H if you want a

1372
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,920
to take H to be 01 just take the binary

1373
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,640
representation of like each gate the

1374
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:29,960
gates are numbered uh and VI of this

1375
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:31,480
number is the value of this gate in

1376
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:35,240
layer

1377
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:38,200
I okay so each gate in layer I uh has

1378
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:41,359
kind of a number which is a number in h

1379
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:45,119
to the m and this is the value of the

1380
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:46,920
gate okay now what is h and what is M I

1381
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,400
said you know it needs to be of size H

1382
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:52,039
to the m b s needs H to the m needs to

1383
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:55,680
be S so I have place to write all the

1384
01:06:52,039 --> 01:06:58,240
the a the values of the layers but which

1385
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:01,799
H and which M do I choose and now

1386
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:04,119
actually there's Freedom so in many

1387
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:05,960
times it's easier to think like uh we're

1388
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:08,480
used to Binary because we're kind of

1389
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:12,279
computers uh so it's comfortable to

1390
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:14,440
think of H as being 01 and M to be

1391
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:19,359
logus you can think of it this way

1392
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:22,880
that's fine however later like uh

1393
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:25,520
probably uh uh Rachel will tell you

1394
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,240
about it a it'll be convenient actually

1395
01:07:25,520 --> 01:07:29,119
actually R is like oh no what did I sign

1396
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:32,559
up for it's like I'm not going to tell

1397
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:36,240
you a it'll be convenient actually to

1398
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:38,160
take the parameters which are H being

1399
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:40,480
log

1400
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:43,279
S and

1401
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:46,240
M being log

1402
01:07:43,279 --> 01:07:48,720
s ah okay fine tried to put the same

1403
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:52,559
didn't work M being log

1404
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,559
s over log log

1405
01:07:54,039 --> 01:08:00,480
s so it be convenient to think of these

1406
01:07:57,279 --> 01:08:02,880
parameters so first just

1407
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:07,079
note that log

1408
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:09,319
s to the power of M which is log s over

1409
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:14,799
log log

1410
01:08:09,319 --> 01:08:14,799
s is just log s is just 2 to the log log

1411
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:19,000
s times this

1412
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:26,759
thing these two cancels and therefore

1413
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:28,880
you get in DS so I'm just saying these

1414
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:31,799
parameters indeed if you take H to the

1415
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:35,920
power of M you get S

1416
01:08:31,799 --> 01:08:39,480
back okay because H log s to the power

1417
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:42,040
of M log s over log log s log s is like

1418
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:43,600
2 to the log log s and then the two log

1419
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:47,239
log s cancel and you get two to the log

1420
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:50,120
s which is s so it that this is good

1421
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:51,799
okay you get what you want why why what

1422
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:53,640
so but you can be like why why am I

1423
01:08:51,799 --> 01:08:55,120
taking this setting of parameters and

1424
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,319
you also may be kind of annoyed like why

1425
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,279
am I why are we talking so much about

1426
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:01,080
parameters this is kind of boring and I

1427
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:03,159
agree however this is important because

1428
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:05,719
these parameters are used a lot and for

1429
01:09:03,159 --> 01:09:07,640
a good reason so let me tell you why

1430
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:09,480
these parameters why am I spending your

1431
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:13,239
time on these parameters uh this

1432
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:16,080
specific choice and the reason is that

1433
01:09:13,239 --> 01:09:18,120
later when we'll take extension remember

1434
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:20,799
we have we take extension over a field

1435
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:23,600
we'll take a big field now the

1436
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:27,880
field if you remember the the subject

1437
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:30,960
protocol the soundness you get is like M

1438
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:35,679
* D the number of variables times the

1439
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:39,359
degree over F so F needs to be of size

1440
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:43,600
at least n * D okay so it will need to

1441
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:46,640
be at least like this m which is if you

1442
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:48,920
take like binary like 01 it'll be need

1443
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,359
to be at least log s which is the m or

1444
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:53,040
here you know the number of variables is

1445
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:55,800
not constant usually and it need to be

1446
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:57,520
bigger than the number of variables

1447
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:01,679
and now the problem

1448
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:04,640
is if you take H so okay if you take a

1449
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:07,000
so what we what's very desirable in

1450
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:08,719
later applications in particular for PCP

1451
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,920
applications which we'll talk about it's

1452
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:12,280
really beautiful for those who haven't

1453
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,480
heard of what pcps are we'll learn about

1454
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:17,520
it it's really really nice but for these

1455
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:21,600
applications what you want is that

1456
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:25,840
F the size of the extension you take is

1457
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,840
poly in H

1458
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:31,640
and now if you take H to be 01 which is

1459
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:34,199
what like binary which is what we all

1460
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:36,199
like then the field becomes constant

1461
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:38,080
signs because it needs to be for

1462
01:10:36,199 --> 01:10:41,080
applications like to get the

1463
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:43,840
PCP you need F if f is bigger you'll get

1464
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:46,360
like a super polinomial object so to get

1465
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:49,400
kind of a for later applications it's

1466
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:52,360
important that the field is not too much

1467
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:56,239
bigger than H that it's polom related to

1468
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:58,840
H and then if you take H to be small

1469
01:10:56,239 --> 01:11:00,440
like constant like 01 then f is a

1470
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:02,480
constant and then you don't get T

1471
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:05,560
because m is not a constant to get T

1472
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:07,320
bigger than one you got nothing so this

1473
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,520
is if you didn't follow it doesn't

1474
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:11,040
matter you will see it when we talk

1475
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:13,360
about PCP but this is just to tell you

1476
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:15,600
why I'm choosing these weird parameters

1477
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,080
as opposed to 01 the point is that later

1478
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,440
we'll need these parameters when we'll

1479
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:23,719
talk about PCP and so that's why we're

1480
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:26,719
using them now you GK itself GK itself

1481
01:11:23,719 --> 01:11:29,640
you don't need writing down the entire

1482
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:31,400
exactly because so I exactly because in

1483
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,880
GK it's interactive you're never writing

1484
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:37,000
down the entire thing for gkr itself you

1485
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:38,960
can take H to be 01 and you can take F

1486
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,840
to be big and like the kind of

1487
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,600
parameters you want I was actually

1488
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:45,440
debating if to teach it was Z1 and then

1489
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,840
to change all the parameters or and many

1490
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,440
like if you look at Justin Taylor's

1491
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:52,600
notes that are in the website I gave the

1492
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:55,000
exact chapter then he use a 01 because

1493
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:56,600
it's easier and you know uh but since

1494
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,920
we're I'm going to change the parameters

1495
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,600
anyway I thought I'll just start with

1496
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,120
them and I think it's good to get

1497
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,960
accustomed to these type of parameters

1498
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:05,440
because they show up a

1499
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,239
lot okay so this is just kind of if you

1500
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:09,360
didn't follow exact Choice don't worry

1501
01:12:07,239 --> 01:12:10,040
about it it turns out this is the choice

1502
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,600
I

1503
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:14,199
want and why you learn about it when we

1504
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,000
talk about

1505
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:20,600
pcps but if you don't if you want to

1506
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,520
think about H is 01 and M is log s you

1507
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:24,679
can do so all the lecture everything I

1508
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:26,239
say makes sense in that parameters and

1509
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:28,639
you know you understand everything with

1510
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:30,320
these uh parameters as well for

1511
01:12:28,639 --> 01:12:35,120
today

1512
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:37,520
okay so good so now so now what does the

1513
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:43,040
prover what will the prover do the

1514
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:43,040
prover will so he has for

1515
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:50,320
every for every layer he has the values

1516
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:53,560
of the gates he computes the values of

1517
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:57,199
the gates of that

1518
01:12:53,560 --> 01:13:01,120
layer which is you can think about

1519
01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:01,120
it as for each

1520
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:09,800
layer I the prover computes VI which is

1521
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:12,120
the value of all the gates in layer I so

1522
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:16,320
we can think of the gates is kind of

1523
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:18,320
going from H to the m to 01 each gate

1524
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:20,840
has a label in h to the m because it's

1525
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:23,920
kind of the same as a morphic to S so

1526
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:26,120
each gate has a label here and this is

1527
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,840
just the why the value of the gate on

1528
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:30,880
input

1529
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:32,040
X okay so the this is the pro I there's

1530
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,040
no protocol yet I'm just talking about

1531
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,719
the pro or compus before the protocol

1532
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:40,360
begins

1533
01:13:35,719 --> 01:13:42,520
okay and now the prover can compute the

1534
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:45,080
low degree

1535
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:49,400
extension okay so this let me actually

1536
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:49,400
be careful with room so I'll write it

1537
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:58,679
here this is nothing but the low degree

1538
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,679
EXT ion of

1539
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:07,280
VI okay now we're in business once the

1540
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:08,920
prover computed this then we're in good

1541
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,760
shape so now what now let's go back to

1542
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:14,120
the protocol what do they

1543
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:17,320
do so as we said the

1544
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:19,520
goal is to reduce so remember the first

1545
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:21,880
thing the prover gave the verifier you

1546
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:26,080
can think of the protocol started with

1547
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:28,199
v0 which is the output layer and one

1548
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:31,360
element let me call it z0 because we're

1549
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:34,600
going to call them Z and z0 in you know

1550
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:36,120
H to the m in this time which is kind of

1551
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:39,159
actually the output layer has just one

1552
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:41,280
gate right it's zero or one we we added

1553
01:14:39,159 --> 01:14:42,800
a bunch of zeros to it because we dummy

1554
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:45,480
gates to assume that it's kind of a size

1555
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:48,280
s but there's one gate this is let's

1556
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:50,480
call this gate z0 and he's arguing on z0

1557
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:53,000
there's a certain value v0 in our case

1558
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:55,480
we said it's one so he comes with an

1559
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,520
argument right he tells a look if you

1560
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,880
look at the output layer this is the

1561
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,880
output

1562
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:05,960
layer if you look at the output layer

1563
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,760
and the relevant gate and the actual

1564
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:11,560
single not

1565
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:14,440
gate I claim the output is v0 namely

1566
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:17,400
let's say one now I say why would I

1567
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:20,400
trust you and he said okay let let me

1568
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,400
help you

1569
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:29,239
here I can always add till the you know

1570
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:32,719
okay so now let's see what is v0 Tilda

1571
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:36,320
on any element Z what is this value

1572
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:38,000
remember this is the output yeah so it

1573
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:40,560
is

1574
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,320
what and what I'm saying here is

1575
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,800
actually General even let's think of I

1576
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:46,560
like layer I okay you can think of layer

1577
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:49,199
zero if you want but any layer take any

1578
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:52,440
layer and take any Z even in the

1579
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:55,080
extension in F to the N here it happened

1580
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:56,400
to be that the z0 was actually kind of

1581
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,679
in the extension even because we started

1582
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:00,159
with a certain gate but let's kind of

1583
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:03,440
think of it more broadly because later

1584
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:07,600
we'll go to we'll be in the extension so

1585
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:11,840
I have the the prover claims that this

1586
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:14,080
is VI we start with i equals

1587
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,760
zero I don't know if that's true I want

1588
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:20,360
to reduce it to a claim about layer i+

1589
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:23,880
one one layer down how do I do that what

1590
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:25,719
is VI Tilda and Z zi in general is in

1591
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:28,080
the extension in in this case it's not

1592
01:16:25,719 --> 01:16:30,040
but in general it's in an extension so

1593
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:32,679
first thing let me move the I not to the

1594
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:36,480
extension so what let's let's remember

1595
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:36,480
what is VI Tilda VI Tilda is

1596
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:44,520
some a VI that kind of the original VI

1597
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:46,600
and H let me make sure I'm consistent

1598
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:49,600
with my notation so I won't confuse

1599
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,600
myself

1600
01:16:49,840 --> 01:17:01,600
um okay and point p in H to the

1601
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:07,679
m times this Kai

1602
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:09,760
P of Z I just I just kind of uh right so

1603
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:13,239
what is the low degree extension of V

1604
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:15,400
it's the vi on every Point not in the

1605
01:17:13,239 --> 01:17:17,480
extension in the cube in h to the m

1606
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:20,080
times this kind of Kai

1607
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:22,480
function you know which was this oh I

1608
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,480
erased it but it's the oh yeah this

1609
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,960
multiplication each one of them was this

1610
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:33,880
degree hus one function

1611
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:37,960
okay but what is a what is vi

1612
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:41,320
vi you can e we can e relate it to the

1613
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:43,880
layer one below VI is either an ad gate

1614
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:46,440
or multiplication gate if it's an ad

1615
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:47,920
gate it's an add of two elements below

1616
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:51,800
and if it's a mul a multiplication of

1617
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:53,960
two elements below so now to to connect

1618
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,639
it to the layer below and this is goes

1619
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:58,520
to the question of what does the

1620
01:17:55,639 --> 01:18:01,199
verifier know it doesn't know what I'm

1621
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:04,000
going to use is the circuit has so the

1622
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:06,000
circuit is associated for every I with

1623
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,120
an add

1624
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:13,159
function and a multiplication function

1625
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:16,520
and this function goes from 01 to

1626
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:18,520
the I guess 3 log

1627
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:22,360
s to

1628
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:25,719
01 and it just says whether there's you

1629
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:28,440
take a gate in layer I in two gates in

1630
01:18:25,719 --> 01:18:31,480
layer I + one and it checks whether

1631
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:36,719
there's an add there okay so it takes

1632
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:38,600
kind of i j and k and it says one if and

1633
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:41,800
only

1634
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:45,880
if gate

1635
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:51,800
I oh sorry I is

1636
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:55,159
taken what notation did I use a okay H

1637
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:58,520
sorry it takes

1638
01:18:55,159 --> 01:19:02,400
a gate P W1 and

1639
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:07,199
W2 in in in s you know one of the gates

1640
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:10,760
and it outputs one if and only if gate

1641
01:19:07,199 --> 01:19:10,760
p in layer

1642
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:20,560
I is a

1643
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:23,440
add of

1644
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:27,120
gates W1 and

1645
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:30,639
W2 in layer I +

1646
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,639
1 and zero

1647
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:37,120
otherwise uh I I start with zero and I

1648
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:41,600
go down to

1649
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:41,600
D yeah and zero

1650
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:47,840
otherwise okay so just check if there's

1651
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:50,120
an and there if there's an add there and

1652
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:52,480
mult is exactly the same Mal checks if

1653
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:56,159
there's a multiplication gate okay so

1654
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:58,080
malt also takes p a point p in layer I

1655
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:01,080
two points in layer I plus one and it

1656
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:03,320
outputs one if and only if this gate p

1657
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:06,040
in layer I is actually a mult gate a

1658
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:09,400
multiplication gate and it connects to

1659
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:12,880
Gates W1 W2 in layer I I

1660
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:18,679
+1 okay okay so what is this now we can

1661
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:23,320
say this is nothing but sum of

1662
01:20:18,679 --> 01:20:27,520
P let's sum over all the possible W1 and

1663
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:30,960
W2 all the gates in the layer below and

1664
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:36,920
see maybe it adds so let's if it's if

1665
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:42,960
there's add if add i p W1 W2 if that's

1666
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:47,360
one then you have v i then VP is just VI

1667
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,360
W1 plus VI I

1668
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:55,360
W2 if again if p is an is a is an ad

1669
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:58,080
gate if it's not ad gate you'll get a

1670
01:20:55,360 --> 01:21:00,880
zero so you're not adding anything if it

1671
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:02,440
happens to be an ad gate then what the

1672
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:04,600
value of this gate is just the sum of

1673
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:08,960
the values of the gates

1674
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:10,960
below if VP if p is not an add gate all

1675
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:13,400
this is zero I didn't do anything

1676
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:15,040
because I multiply by add which is

1677
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:17,120
zero

1678
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:19,960
okay

1679
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:25,960
plus some plus

1680
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:29,159
uh let me just open plus m

1681
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:33,000
i p W1

1682
01:21:29,159 --> 01:21:36,800
W2 if it's a multiplication

1683
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:39,360
gate and let's say it's connected to W1

1684
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:41,800
W2 I'm still in the sum then what do I

1685
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:45,800
do then what's the value of of

1686
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,800
VIP I mean VI in point

1687
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:55,159
P exactly VI on point W1 times because

1688
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:59,560
it's a multiplication gate

1689
01:21:55,159 --> 01:22:00,480
VI in W2 ah sorry plus one thank you

1690
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:05,360
thank

1691
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:05,360
you yes great

1692
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:17,120
good and all of this times this uh

1693
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:17,120
polinomial k p of

1694
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,520
Z good

1695
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:32,760
okay so now where are we we want to

1696
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:38,120
prove something about layer

1697
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:42,159
I right we but we managed to write it as

1698
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:43,760
sum of elements in layer I + one that's

1699
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:45,320
great that's really what we wanted we

1700
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:49,760
went one layer

1701
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:52,760
down okay but so okay and

1702
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,760
well

1703
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:58,480
note this is really similar to a su Che

1704
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:01,600
what do we have here we want to prove

1705
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:05,080
that VI so I want to tell the the prover

1706
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:06,840
prove to me that instead of he claims VI

1707
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:09,320
is this value I'm like I don't know what

1708
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:11,800
this value is prove to me that VI is

1709
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,800
equal to the

1710
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:17,360
sum so prove to me that VI is equal to

1711
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:19,760
something about the layer

1712
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:24,960
below how does they prove that something

1713
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:27,520
is equal to the sum sum check right

1714
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,639
okay so do the subject protocol and now

1715
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,239
you're saying wait but where's the

1716
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:34,239
polinomial ah no problem everything's

1717
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:34,239
over H ofm look at the

1718
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:40,159
extensions this is already polinomial we

1719
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,159
don't care about that's

1720
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:46,239
good look at the

1721
01:23:42,679 --> 01:23:48,440
extensions okay we have a low degree

1722
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:51,719
extension up

1723
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:55,520
here any polinomial can be

1724
01:23:51,719 --> 01:23:59,520
extended look at the extension

1725
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:04,000
okay so now we want to argue that VI

1726
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:08,679
equals the sum this entire thing this

1727
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:10,920
entire thing I argue is a low degree

1728
01:24:08,679 --> 01:24:13,080
polinomial why is this a low degree

1729
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:16,560
polinomial let's see first of all it's a

1730
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:19,120
polinomial over H to the 3M because M

1731
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:22,320
here and two W's here so we're talking

1732
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:27,480
about three M variables but m is small

1733
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:28,960
this is good m is s over log log s so

1734
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:31,440
that's that's

1735
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:33,360
good what about here what are so let's

1736
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:35,520
first look at the degree the degree of

1737
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:38,400
these things it's the low degree

1738
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:39,679
extension it's h minus one of each one

1739
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,600
okay because I'm really taking each one

1740
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:44,400
is H each add everything is kind of oh

1741
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:48,600
add is even better because we did zero

1742
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:50,960
one so add is even better uh you could

1743
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:50,960
you could

1744
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:59,480
do oh sorry

1745
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:59,480
uh now can I take it

1746
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:05,159
back I also want to do add in

1747
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:11,320
h everything is in I I made a mistake I

1748
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:13,760
put0 one but I need to be consistent if

1749
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:16,040
I'm an H I'm an H so H to the everything

1750
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,040
is an

1751
01:25:16,239 --> 01:25:23,000
H so everything here is degree H minus

1752
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:24,600
one so good so so it's more than hus one

1753
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,360
because I have your multiplication dou 1

1754
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:30,159
appears here W1 appears here uh so it's

1755
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:32,280
going to be degree 2 hus1 fine but hus

1756
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:33,719
one is small it's like log so two logs

1757
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:36,719
so the degree is small the number of

1758
01:25:33,719 --> 01:25:38,520
variables small perfect just do some

1759
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:43,239
check so now you're asking what is the

1760
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:45,760
gkr protocol sum check that's it okay

1761
01:25:43,239 --> 01:25:49,480
you start with with

1762
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:53,679
v0 you tell them do su check convert it

1763
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:55,560
to a a uh convert this claim about the

1764
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:57,159
output which the verifier has no idea

1765
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:59,880
it's so far away from him he doesn't

1766
01:25:57,159 --> 01:26:03,679
know what said give me let's do the sum

1767
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:06,239
Che protocol to reduce this claim to a

1768
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:08,199
claim about some

1769
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:10,280
about this thing

1770
01:26:08,199 --> 01:26:11,760
essentially but now this is very

1771
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:13,840
confusing because what happens when we

1772
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:16,920
do the sum Che protocol when we do the

1773
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,840
sum Che protocol we reduce if you

1774
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:23,040
remember let's look for a second at the

1775
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:26,119
sum check here we want to prove that the

1776
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:30,600
sum of of something there it's a huge

1777
01:26:26,119 --> 01:26:33,199
thing add V plus malt multiplication of

1778
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:35,080
V all this craziness whatever low degree

1779
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:36,360
is equal to Beta is equal to something

1780
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:39,679
in that case

1781
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:42,880
v0 we run the subject protocol at the

1782
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:45,239
end the verifier needs to compute to

1783
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:47,520
check in the subject protocol we assume

1784
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:49,400
that the verifier has Oracle access to

1785
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:51,719
the

1786
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:54,280
polinomial okay but essentially he needs

1787
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:57,440
to compute this function the polinomial

1788
01:26:54,280 --> 01:27:00,560
on some point now maybe has Oracle

1789
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:02,960
access at that point great but maybe

1790
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:06,400
okay but there's no Oracles in our in in

1791
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:07,719
this in in gkr so what do we do now but

1792
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:11,840
here's an important observation that

1793
01:27:07,719 --> 01:27:14,119
we'll use note yes the Prov needs the

1794
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:17,080
sorry the verifier need when he verifies

1795
01:27:14,119 --> 01:27:22,159
the sum check he needs to compute the

1796
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:26,280
polom on a single point but this point T

1797
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:28,960
T1 of the TM is a random Point that's

1798
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:30,639
chosen by the verifier okay when you

1799
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:33,600
look what is the subject protocol the

1800
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:36,920
verifier chooses a random T1 he get the

1801
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:38,840
polinomial then to a random T2 and so on

1802
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:41,440
so forth at the end he needs to Value F

1803
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:44,159
and T1 up to TM that he

1804
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:48,480
chose okay we will use

1805
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:52,440
this okay so now let's see what happened

1806
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:54,679
here after we did the sum check the poor

1807
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:56,760
verifier needs to

1808
01:27:54,679 --> 01:27:58,760
compute let me again make sure I'm

1809
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:02,760
consistent with my

1810
01:27:58,760 --> 01:28:04,719
notation good the verifier now need so

1811
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:08,239
he does the sum check let's denote kind

1812
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:12,360
of the the a Randomness that he used in

1813
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:15,719
the sum check by

1814
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:18,760
a so we started with with I let's say

1815
01:28:15,719 --> 01:28:23,679
that when we reached here let's say he

1816
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:23,679
needs to compute a

1817
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:30,679
add Tilda on z i + one because we moveed

1818
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:32,679
to layer I +

1819
01:28:30,679 --> 01:28:35,639
one uh

1820
01:28:32,679 --> 01:28:40,480
0 z i +

1821
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:46,159
1 1 z i + 1

1822
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:49,600
2 times VI I + 1 and another end so that

1823
01:28:46,159 --> 01:28:54,159
was one so Z ah I don't like this

1824
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:54,159
notation sorry let me change it

1825
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,960
it's more cumbersome on the board than

1826
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:02,320
in the okay let me call z0 Z1 Z2 so

1827
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:04,199
suppose they do a subject protocol in

1828
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:07,000
the subject it's on three M

1829
01:29:04,199 --> 01:29:08,719
variables so let's to not the randomness

1830
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,760
used by the verifier and the subject

1831
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:14,199
protocol by z0 Z1 Z2 each of them is in

1832
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,199
F to the

1833
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:22,199
m so now the verifier needs to compute

1834
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:23,760
this function on the point Z 0 Z1 Z2

1835
01:29:22,199 --> 01:29:25,159
what is this function on this point it's

1836
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:29,679
add

1837
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:35,400
time VI +1 Tilda on

1838
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:35,400
Z1 plus VI + one Tilda on

1839
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:40,040
Z2 plus

1840
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:50,639
malt z0 Z1

1841
01:29:44,199 --> 01:29:52,239
Z2 times VI +1 Z1 Tilda times VI I + 1

1842
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:56,040
Z2

1843
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:56,040
Tilda and then all this

1844
01:29:57,159 --> 01:30:07,040
times this uh ah this

1845
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:09,840
Sky I'll put it here Kai P of Z of uh Z

1846
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:09,840
of oh

1847
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:18,719
oops sorry I missed this notation uh

1848
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:18,719
this is the zi H

1849
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:26,760
okay sorry okay zi is the Original Point

1850
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:30,840
yeah that we started with we started a

1851
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:33,040
claim about VI equals VI T of z z is a

1852
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:36,560
fixed point that we started

1853
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:39,280
with the randomness of the verifier in

1854
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:43,679
the subject protocol I denoted by z0 Z1

1855
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:43,679
Z2 these are chosen by the verifier yes

1856
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:46,880
v

1857
01:30:47,199 --> 01:30:52,520
b yeah but yeah exactly but I'm in layer

1858
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:56,840
I you're right in layer zero it's just Z

1859
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:56,840
zero no no no the P

1860
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,320
right oh I

1861
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:09,360
replaced yes oh H

1862
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:20,480
yesing yes yes yes yes yes the rename

1863
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:22,800
you're right yes yes z uh uh z0 yes yes

1864
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:24,600
you're right you're right you're right

1865
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:28,239
and this is still load degree polinomial

1866
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:30,840
in z z good point it's sitting H yeah

1867
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:33,480
maybe I erased it but this no but I

1868
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:33,480
didn't write

1869
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:40,040
this below

1870
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:43,040
here no but I need to

1871
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:46,159
write it's like this is

1872
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:50,159
uh uh

1873
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:50,159
X IUS

1874
01:32:00,199 --> 01:32:06,119
I think yes so it's

1875
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:10,880
uh a oh maybe I need to take extension

1876
01:32:06,119 --> 01:32:13,520
of this sorry one second this is hold

1877
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:15,440
on sorry maybe I missed this let me

1878
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:20,440
think because I missing the the in the

1879
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:22,560
notes so hold on so here the point is

1880
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:25,840
a

1881
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,840
is eight

1882
01:32:29,639 --> 01:32:35,320
I think I need to take extension of this

1883
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:38,440
too because the the the point here a

1884
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,440
this is not a polinomial in

1885
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:43,520
ag okay so let's let's do that carefully

1886
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:46,560
sorry I missed that

1887
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:48,400
so Kai is a low degree polinomial but

1888
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:52,920
it's a low polom in

1889
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:54,960
X it's not a l po this H okay H here is

1890
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:57,159
like in the

1891
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,239
in in in the denominator so it's not a l

1892
01:32:57,159 --> 01:33:02,159
degree pomal in

1893
01:32:59,239 --> 01:33:05,880
h sadly

1894
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:07,480
but but you can extend so it's okay

1895
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:10,000
don't worry so it's not low degree

1896
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:12,719
polinomial however it is in you can all

1897
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:18,320
we care about is

1898
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:23,719
um a if we think of it as a function of

1899
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:23,719
z0 of of a uh

1900
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:29,320
yeah of P then we just extend EXT we

1901
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:40,400
can I just want to make sure that I'm

1902
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:40,400
not missing something so hold on one

1903
01:33:45,639 --> 01:33:51,239
second

1904
01:33:47,159 --> 01:33:52,800
yeah mhm okay yeah so you the way to

1905
01:33:51,239 --> 01:33:54,480
think about this sorry about that the

1906
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,960
way to think about it

1907
01:33:54,480 --> 01:34:00,520
is to think of

1908
01:33:55,960 --> 01:34:04,280
this as Kai of p and

1909
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:06,600
Z it's low degree in this it's not low

1910
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:09,480
degree in this but you can think about

1911
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:12,239
it it's in 01 you can think of Kai as

1912
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:17,920
like zero it's in sorry you can think of

1913
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:22,480
Kai as being in h to the m time F to the

1914
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:25,719
m to whatever to a

1915
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,719
a z

1916
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:46,760
um I'm not sure how to because maybe but

1917
01:34:44,119 --> 01:34:48,119
I'm not sure but I mean there is there

1918
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:51,600
is actually I'm going to the low degree

1919
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:53,040
polinomial is is one of them so the

1920
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:55,080
answer is yes there is it's the low

1921
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:58,719
degree ex the

1922
01:34:55,080 --> 01:35:02,600
uh yeah so it's defined only an H you

1923
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:05,520
can think of it as defined only this Kai

1924
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:08,920
is an extension this Kai in its own is

1925
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:12,840
extension what is this Kai this Kai is a

1926
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:15,719
function you can okay sorry let me write

1927
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:18,360
let me write it differently okay let me

1928
01:35:15,719 --> 01:35:22,320
fix this sorry about

1929
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:26,000
that instead of this think of

1930
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:29,520
Kai I'm just changing the rotation H1 up

1931
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,520
to hm and Z which is Z1 up to

1932
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:33,080
ZM okay I don't want to put it down

1933
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:37,239
there they're both

1934
01:35:33,080 --> 01:35:40,119
here and now actually I I

1935
01:35:37,239 --> 01:35:44,320
don't uh okay so what are we saying

1936
01:35:40,119 --> 01:35:46,159
we're saying so this is the extension so

1937
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:50,400
you're saying what is Kai I'll tell you

1938
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:55,639
what Kai is Kai is the

1939
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:55,639
extension a okay let me rewrite this

1940
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:08,920
Kai Kai and H and sorry H1 up to hm Z1

1941
01:36:07,239 --> 01:36:15,440
up to

1942
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:16,600
ZM is just multiplication of kaih Z so

1943
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:18,880
it's exactly the same thing I just don't

1944
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:21,119
want to put hi on the bottom like I did

1945
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:23,760
before so let me put it as a variable I

1946
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:26,159
didn't change anything and now this

1947
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:29,040
origin what is this this is the low

1948
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:32,920
degree extension of the function let me

1949
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:36,280
first Define Kai and H to the 2m so Kai

1950
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:42,679
is such that an H to the 2m so for every

1951
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:48,280
hi I or for every H and z in h to the

1952
01:36:42,679 --> 01:36:49,480
m Kai HZ is equal to one if in only if H

1953
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:52,199
is equal to

1954
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:55,800
Z I only Define an H of them now

1955
01:36:52,199 --> 01:36:57,760
extended that's how I Define Kai okay

1956
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:59,239
the unique low degree extension what is

1957
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:01,000
exactly the extension yeah it's like

1958
01:36:59,239 --> 01:37:02,440
this multiplication blah blah blah I

1959
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:06,679
don't want to go into

1960
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:06,679
it okay but it's just a unique

1961
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:12,719
extension okay so now with

1962
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:19,159
that and and the reason the reason there

1963
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:25,080
is a unique I actually I should say this

1964
01:37:19,159 --> 01:37:25,080
is a this is kind of kai1

1965
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:31,280
and the reason there is a unique

1966
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:31,280
extension this is kind of H1 hi

1967
01:37:31,639 --> 01:37:36,480
Z and the reason there is a unique

1968
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:38,119
exception is from the legi interpolation

1969
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:41,040
theorem okay so it's just a

1970
01:37:38,119 --> 01:37:43,599
multiplication of the unique kind of L

1971
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:45,360
interpolation extensions so all I did

1972
01:37:43,599 --> 01:37:47,159
here so sorry about this but all I did

1973
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:50,639
here is I changed the notation from the

1974
01:37:47,159 --> 01:37:52,719
h kind of as a subscript to H as input

1975
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:54,199
and now I'm doing kind of I'm treating

1976
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:56,599
them both symmetrically which was

1977
01:37:54,199 --> 01:37:58,840
important because otherwise so thank you

1978
01:37:56,599 --> 01:38:03,320
wow you guys are

1979
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:12,800
great so now okay so now let's fix the

1980
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:16,400
mistake here so this is Kai of p and

1981
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:17,840
Z right p is we're summing over P but Z

1982
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:19,400
is an input that's kind of the input we

1983
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:24,159
started with like that's the

1984
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:26,880
claim good and now but for me Kai is a

1985
01:38:24,159 --> 01:38:28,239
low degree polinomial already so this is

1986
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:33,840
just

1987
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:37,599
Kai of z0 and X I thank

1988
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:40,920
you yeah I guess what I don't understand

1989
01:38:37,599 --> 01:38:43,920
not po the first

1990
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,920
variable

1991
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:51,199
why okay so let's look at the definition

1992
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:54,400
of Kai right the definition of Kai and M

1993
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:56,679
variables is just so the Kai takes two M

1994
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:59,159
variables the definition two M variables

1995
01:38:56,679 --> 01:39:03,360
is just the multiplication I goes from 1

1996
01:38:59,159 --> 01:39:05,880
to M of like a Kai one on hi and Z so

1997
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:08,199
now I need to Define what is Kai

1998
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:09,880
one oh you're saying it's a it's two

1999
01:39:08,199 --> 01:39:12,880
variables it's not you're saying it's

2000
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:18,719
not one variable oh or rather more like

2001
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:20,199
in K1 like isn't it not a pol in hi it's

2002
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:24,040
a polinomial no I want to think of it's

2003
01:39:20,199 --> 01:39:26,840
a polinomial in hi and z

2004
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:29,040
okay Kai sorry okay maybe I didn't

2005
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:31,599
understand your question kai1 is a two

2006
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:33,679
variable polinomial it has two variables

2007
01:39:31,599 --> 01:39:36,159
so you're right it doesn't it's a it's

2008
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:37,639
it's two variables not one because I

2009
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:40,119
said it reduces to lrange you're saying

2010
01:39:37,639 --> 01:39:42,360
no lrange is one I'm thinking of it's

2011
01:39:40,119 --> 01:39:44,000
two that that's what you said right or

2012
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:45,760
maybe I I guess my question is more

2013
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,679
emphasizing like when you write out the

2014
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:50,840
definition for K1 AR we going to get

2015
01:39:48,679 --> 01:39:55,199
that it's not a pol in

2016
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:57,440
hi no it is it is so I I want to is

2017
01:39:55,199 --> 01:40:00,840
going to be a ratio of pols no no no no

2018
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:03,440
no no no no no no so okay you can ask

2019
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:06,520
what is exactly kaii how do or kai1 how

2020
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:09,520
do it okay Kai Kai is well defined it's

2021
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:12,880
just a product of Kai On's okay now you

2022
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:13,960
can ask what is kai1 if you if I if you

2023
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:15,040
understand what kai1 is then you

2024
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:17,920
understand what Kai is because Kai is

2025
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:20,400
just multiplication what is kai1 kai1 is

2026
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:24,080
a byari polinomial it's defined over F

2027
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:25,400
to M to F and

2028
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:27,040
and how so now you're asking how is it

2029
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:30,320
defined let me tell you how it's defined

2030
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:31,679
an H first so if both of them it's a

2031
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:33,159
first of all it's it's a polinomial it's

2032
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:35,159
a two VAR polinomial so it's a

2033
01:40:33,159 --> 01:40:38,599
polinomial and two variables and both

2034
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:43,159
its degree H minus one okay now you can

2035
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:45,800
say how is it defined on H on H I'll

2036
01:40:43,159 --> 01:40:47,679
tell you it's one if and only if they're

2037
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:50,800
equal that's how it's Define zero

2038
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:54,560
otherwise so I defined it on H now you

2039
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:58,040
can ask how do I Define it on F so on F

2040
01:40:54,560 --> 01:41:00,760
I'm going to Define it in the unique way

2041
01:40:58,040 --> 01:41:03,040
that extends it on on H that's how it's

2042
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:03,040
going to be

2043
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:09,560
defined okay that's kind of that that's

2044
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,520
so it's Kai is a low degree Pol normal

2045
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:14,679
in each and every variable that's how

2046
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:17,000
before I wrote it like only n z but

2047
01:41:14,679 --> 01:41:19,679
that's that wasn't good because I I need

2048
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:22,679
it also to be low degree on AG so yes

2049
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:22,679
VOD

2050
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
exactly

2051
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,480
exactly okay okay so I I write it I I

2052
01:41:36,119 --> 01:41:40,760
what's important to me is that K1 is a

2053
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:43,920
polinomial it's a two Vari polinomial

2054
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:48,280
both of them are degree H minus one okay

2055
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:51,040
so with that if we believe if yeah um

2056
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:53,599
they not equal is it zero yeah yeah yeah

2057
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:56,639
yeah yeah so if H and z are equals one

2058
01:41:53,599 --> 01:42:00,400
if they're not equal zero yes

2059
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:04,880
great thank you thank you guys you're

2060
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:07,520
great a fantastic so now we reduced this

2061
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:10,840
big sum to

2062
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:15,239
this because we sum over the P so the P

2063
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:17,880
becomes uh Z zero this

2064
01:42:15,239 --> 01:42:19,199
okay wow what's going on here what is

2065
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:21,760
the proof what is the verifier supposed

2066
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:25,040
to do so before he had one he need to

2067
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:26,280
verify one little kind of one point in

2068
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:30,599
VI

2069
01:42:26,280 --> 01:42:30,599
Tilda and now we needs to verify this

2070
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:39,199
mess okay so

2071
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:42,239
let's let's let's uh yeah deconstruct

2072
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:46,679
yes sorry is the argument you like K

2073
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:50,199
like z z Z1 or z i uh this is a good

2074
01:42:46,679 --> 01:42:51,960
sorry this is z this is the claim we ah

2075
01:42:50,199 --> 01:42:53,570
this is the claim we started with we

2076
01:42:51,960 --> 01:42:57,180
started with a claim

2077
01:42:53,570 --> 01:42:57,180
[Applause]

2078
01:42:57,199 --> 01:43:01,599
and layer I right you can think of I as

2079
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:05,320
zero in the beginning but we start with

2080
01:43:01,599 --> 01:43:08,119
the claim that VI is equal you know the

2081
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:12,400
low degree extension of layer I in point

2082
01:43:08,119 --> 01:43:14,760
Z this is the Z here because why why is

2083
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:18,040
it the Z let's see what did we say we

2084
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:20,960
said that VI we need to argue that it's

2085
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:22,360
this but this is just some that's the

2086
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:23,639
definition of low degree extension some

2087
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:29,199
the points times

2088
01:43:23,639 --> 01:43:32,159
this ah let me change this to p z the Z

2089
01:43:29,199 --> 01:43:36,719
is fixed this is fixed this is uh from

2090
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:38,719
the claim good now we say let's sum over

2091
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:41,440
the P so we sum over the P the p is not

2092
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:43,639
fixed it's summed over and now we say

2093
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:45,639
let's instead of this like some over the

2094
01:43:43,639 --> 01:43:49,000
two W's with are which are the possible

2095
01:43:45,639 --> 01:43:51,239
kids all the possible pair of kids oh I

2096
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:54,080
think I didn't say I assume that c is

2097
01:43:51,239 --> 01:43:55,760
fan fan in two that each gate has only

2098
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:58,560
two children and that's again without L

2099
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:03,400
of generality you just increase the

2100
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:07,599
depth by log Factor uh so I'm assuming

2101
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:09,840
uh fan fan in two so it's only two each

2102
01:44:07,599 --> 01:44:12,639
uh gate has either it's either an and

2103
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:15,520
addition of two or multiplication of two

2104
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:18,040
now what okay so this is what we get and

2105
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:21,520
now when we do the sum check

2106
01:44:18,040 --> 01:44:23,960
protocol the p and the dou so we sum

2107
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:26,400
over P W1 and w

2108
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:28,760
two at the end of the day we need to

2109
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:31,239
compute this Pol the ver need to compute

2110
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:36,119
this polinomial instead of over some

2111
01:44:31,239 --> 01:44:40,560
fixed P W1 W2 it's over some I called it

2112
01:44:36,119 --> 01:44:41,679
Z1 z0 Z1 Z2 chosen by the verifier

2113
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:46,239
that's kind of the randomness of the

2114
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:47,239
verifier so P becomes z0 W1 becomes Z1

2115
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:50,080
and this is

2116
01:44:47,239 --> 01:44:52,400
Z2 okay that's kind of the F there yeah

2117
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:54,080
this very confused because then if I

2118
01:44:52,400 --> 01:44:57,239
isal to one

2119
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:59,239
you're also using I know I know so

2120
01:44:57,239 --> 01:45:02,639
that's the different Z yeah I know I'm

2121
01:44:59,239 --> 01:45:06,199
so this these are stars

2122
01:45:02,639 --> 01:45:09,080
okay it's a constant it's a constant

2123
01:45:06,199 --> 01:45:13,920
yeah I know that sorry that's a bad

2124
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:16,400
annotation on my end uh yeah uh yeah

2125
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:18,119
this is yeah this is a very very

2126
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:21,760
different Z it's like a totally

2127
01:45:18,119 --> 01:45:24,560
different animal uh uh these are random

2128
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:27,320
Z's chosen by the verifier this is kind

2129
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:28,800
of a you know I don't know a zar that

2130
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:32,840
was fixed ahead of

2131
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:34,840
time okay so okay so now the verifier

2132
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:40,800
needs to verify

2133
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:43,360
this yeah since fixed can't you just use

2134
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:45,880
the same Kai before and put it in the

2135
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:48,639
subscript of the kai so then you don't

2136
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:48,639
need the extension or

2137
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:54,280
whatever ER the thing is that before I

2138
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:56,400
assumed that the the kai when I fixed

2139
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:58,920
the H it was an H to the

2140
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:02,239
m this is in the extension it's not

2141
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:04,599
going to be an H to the m so I don't

2142
01:46:02,239 --> 01:46:09,840
think I think we should keep the two

2143
01:46:04,599 --> 01:46:13,560
yeah but that's a good good uh uh good

2144
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:15,239
idea okay so what does the so it seems

2145
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:16,560
like we had something that looked really

2146
01:46:15,239 --> 01:46:19,280
kind of reasonable and we ended up with

2147
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:21,719
something that's horrifying so how do we

2148
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:23,520
what does the verifier do now he now now

2149
01:46:21,719 --> 01:46:26,440
the verifier is like oh I just need to

2150
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:28,480
verify that this equals some some value

2151
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:31,800
that we got out of the Su protocol so we

2152
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:33,040
did the Su protocol we got some value uh

2153
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:34,880
whatever I don't know what to denote I'm

2154
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:36,520
now scared to denote anything so this

2155
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:38,440
equals something now what is he supposed

2156
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:41,880
to he's supposed to verify

2157
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:43,880
that what what do you do so here's the

2158
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:46,360
idea and then we'll take a

2159
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:48,480
break okay so he needs to verify a lot

2160
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:51,480
of things first he needs to compute this

2161
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:53,599
at Tilda and mult Tilda this goes back

2162
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:55,840
to your question now at these are a

2163
01:46:53,599 --> 01:46:57,239
function of of the circuit he doesn't

2164
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,880
have the circuit how does he compute

2165
01:46:57,239 --> 01:47:02,080
these attia and

2166
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:05,159
multia okay turns out

2167
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:06,920
actually this is sad news he actually

2168
01:47:05,159 --> 01:47:08,960
can't compute we don't know how to

2169
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:10,719
compute he doesn't know how to compute

2170
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:13,920
at Tilda and

2171
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:17,159
multia okay he gets this even if he gets

2172
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:19,199
this kind of uh uh uniform description

2173
01:47:17,159 --> 01:47:19,920
of the of the TR machine that generates

2174
01:47:19,199 --> 01:47:23,480
the

2175
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:25,639
circuit he can't compute them okay

2176
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:27,920
let's deal with that later suppose he

2177
01:47:25,639 --> 01:47:30,000
has Oracle access suppose someone he can

2178
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:33,159
kind of there's a trusted Oracle that

2179
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:35,199
lets him compute these values for now

2180
01:47:33,159 --> 01:47:36,920
okay in the in the paper it's called

2181
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:38,679
like the barebones protocol so suppose

2182
01:47:36,920 --> 01:47:40,920
somehow magically he has a trusted

2183
01:47:38,679 --> 01:47:43,080
Oracle but only to compute ad Tilda and

2184
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:45,440
mul Tilda note these are only functions

2185
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:48,239
of the circuit they have nothing to do

2186
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:49,880
with the claim of the Prov okay it's

2187
01:47:48,239 --> 01:47:53,880
just information about the circuit it's

2188
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:56,639
WEA kind of uh you know uh

2189
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:59,159
I mean not in the extension it's whether

2190
01:47:56,639 --> 01:48:00,880
you know this gate is connected by an an

2191
01:47:59,159 --> 01:48:03,040
to these two gates yes or no or by a

2192
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:05,599
multiplication to these two gates yes or

2193
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:07,000
no so it's not enough for him to compute

2194
01:48:05,599 --> 01:48:08,800
that he needs to compute kind of the low

2195
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,119
degree extension of that but this is

2196
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,920
nothing to do with the approver this is

2197
01:48:10,119 --> 01:48:14,639
just a function of the

2198
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:17,599
circuit so suppose first so first we're

2199
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:20,080
going to assume this is not without L of

2200
01:48:17,599 --> 01:48:22,880
jity but just for Simplicity we're going

2201
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:26,480
to assume

2202
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,480
that V can

2203
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:40,400
compute fosy

2204
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:42,239
can actually what we're going to do

2205
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:44,920
today is we're going to show the entire

2206
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:47,280
GK protocol assuming you can compute

2207
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:49,560
this and then only next time we're going

2208
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:52,800
to show how to compute this thing and

2209
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:54,280
actually there's okay we're going to

2210
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,520
show that next time how can how can we

2211
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:57,159
help him compute it or how can he

2212
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:58,280
compute in a different how do we deal

2213
01:48:57,159 --> 01:49:00,520
with this

2214
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:02,159
issue okay but for now let's say can

2215
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:04,760
compute

2216
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:06,840
this then are are we so okay so the

2217
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:08,960
verif is like okay let's see this I can

2218
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:10,480
definitely compute that's easy okay so

2219
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:12,639
the verifier the verifier can compute

2220
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:15,199
this he can compute

2221
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:17,880
this he can compute

2222
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:22,800
this and what does he's left he's left

2223
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:25,159
with two things he can't compute V i+

2224
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,920
one uh a V2 line plus one and point Z1

2225
01:49:25,159 --> 01:49:31,119
and

2226
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:32,880
Z2 okay so now how do we continue what

2227
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:35,719
we're going to say is the following

2228
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:40,520
suppose in this sum he was cheated

2229
01:49:35,719 --> 01:49:43,639
namely the vi value Vi Star is not

2230
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:46,000
correct by the sum Che protocol it means

2231
01:49:43,639 --> 01:49:48,599
that this entire value is also not

2232
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,960
correct with very high probability okay

2233
01:49:48,599 --> 01:49:51,599
I mean the probity depends on F you'll

2234
01:49:49,960 --> 01:49:53,880
take F large enough that you know it's

2235
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:57,360
going to be with very high probability

2236
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:58,480
so you're left with a a false claim now

2237
01:49:57,360 --> 01:49:59,520
what the verifier is going to do the

2238
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:04,400
verifier is going to tell the approver

2239
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:06,880
you know what tell me what these

2240
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:08,840
two I you gave me something I don't know

2241
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:12,400
what to do with it tell me the values

2242
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:14,159
you tell me the values of of VI + one

2243
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:17,400
Tilda and Z1 and

2244
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:26,080
Z2 so the verify the Prov comes okay

2245
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:27,679
sure vlda and I +1 and Z1 is v i + 1

2246
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:29,840
star

2247
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:31,960
1 and

2248
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:38,239
vlda on

2249
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:39,880
Z2 sorry I + 1 is V Star I + 1 2 here

2250
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:42,920
are the

2251
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:44,880
values now I'm the verifier oh sorry I'm

2252
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:47,920
the verifier what do I do I check I

2253
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:49,800
check that this uh that you know add

2254
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:51,679
times the sum of these two value you

2255
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:53,199
gave me plus Mal times the

2256
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:57,040
multiplication of these two vales you

2257
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:59,520
gave me there is equal what we got

2258
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:02,199
now by the soundness of the subject

2259
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:03,520
protocol we know what we got is false

2260
01:51:02,199 --> 01:51:07,639
it's not

2261
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:12,320
true so the only way if you give me if

2262
01:51:07,639 --> 01:51:15,400
the prover gives the correct

2263
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:16,800
thing then then he he will fail if you

2264
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:18,440
give the correct thing I'll catch him

2265
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:20,400
because if it gives me the correct thing

2266
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:22,800
I get the True

2267
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:24,159
Value but he but but I'm going to check

2268
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:26,880
him against the false

2269
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:30,560
value okay again what do we know he

2270
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:33,520
started with a false Vi Star we did some

2271
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:36,159
S Check we're left with a false we said

2272
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:37,480
that this is something false because the

2273
01:51:36,159 --> 01:51:39,360
soundness of the sub check protocol says

2274
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:42,239
if you started with a some that's false

2275
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:43,960
you'll get a false claim about the F so

2276
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:46,760
now I get that this thing is equal to

2277
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:49,560
some beta but this beta is not

2278
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:51,719
true so now I tell them okay I don't

2279
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:54,440
know how to compute this thing tell me

2280
01:51:51,719 --> 01:51:57,079
what the V the two values in the low

2281
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:59,040
degree extensions are if you tell me

2282
01:51:57,079 --> 01:52:03,000
this assuming I compute this atld and

2283
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:05,760
mlda for now then I compute this thing

2284
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:08,040
now the important thing to note that he

2285
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:11,199
if this value was

2286
01:52:08,040 --> 01:52:12,800
false he must if he gives me the True

2287
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:14,520
Values I'm going to reject them because

2288
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:17,400
I'm going to compute this thing and

2289
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:18,760
check if it's what he claimed it is

2290
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:21,280
after the Su

2291
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:23,320
protocol and because he claimed a false

2292
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:25,280
value if you give me the TR thing things

2293
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:26,440
I'm going to reject him so the only

2294
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:29,000
thing he can do if he doesn't want to be

2295
01:52:26,440 --> 01:52:32,280
rejected off the bat is to give me one

2296
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,280
of them false or both

2297
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:38,000
false two

2298
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:40,800
right

2299
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:43,119
exactly okay so where are we what did we

2300
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:46,239
do after a lot of

2301
01:52:43,119 --> 01:52:49,360
sweat we started with the claim on layer

2302
01:52:46,239 --> 01:52:51,639
ey we did manage to get down to layer I

2303
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:54,560
plus one as I promised you guys here's

2304
01:52:51,639 --> 01:52:57,400
the price first miraculously we assume

2305
01:52:54,560 --> 01:53:02,880
he can compute ad Tilda and mlda on its

2306
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:06,040
own assume why whatever second we got we

2307
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:08,639
went from one Claim about layer I to two

2308
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:11,360
claims about layer I plus one that

2309
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:11,360
doesn't sound very

2310
01:53:13,199 --> 01:53:19,440
reassuring

2311
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:24,000
exactly it's where we started like

2312
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:24,000
okay this is a great time for a break
