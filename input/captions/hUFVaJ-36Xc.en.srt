1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,040
thank you very much uh for the kind

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,320
invitation as well to present my work

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,160
here today with all of you so uh this

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,240
presentation will focus on this new

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,519
invitra model of human skin vasculature

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,480
for the subcutanous

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:22,000
space about that um so before we start

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,000
with the details uh for the project uh

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,599
I'm going to share some details about

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,400
this Consortium so it's actually the

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,920
same general Consortium with Frances as

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,000
well that she just presented but this

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,840
time we're focusing on the skin project

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,120
so it's called humanizing drug

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,039
development skin these are the member

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,879
companies that we have we are currently

17
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,440
are collaborating with five uh major

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,920
Pharma companies this project started on

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,360
February 2022 right when I joined as

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,079
well MIT and it's still ongoing we are

21
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,000
currently phase two and we're discussing

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,199
a phase three so um it's going really

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,280
well uh the main goal of this project

24
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,280
was and still is to de velop an inv

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,040
vitro model of human skin skin

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,640
vasculature for the subcutanous space

27
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,200
and I'm going to S more details later on

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,200
um and then use this model to understand

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,200
and hopefully predict drug by

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,960
availability of uh mostly monoc

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,040
monoclone antibodies or other protein um

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,880
therapeutic drugs and um yeah as we have

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,119
already noticed this is uh the me

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,000
mechanobiology lab uh lead by Roger C

35
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,840
and I'm working in this project to

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,720
together with another post talk uh sangu

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,040
Kim so uh I'm going to start with some

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,960
things that you probably already know uh

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,240
but uh this is kind of an introduction

40
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,479
uh the variability in drug

41
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,719
bioavailability that's a major um factor

42
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,079
in drug development um the drug by

43
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,439
availability the numbers that you get

44
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,960
for each specific drug uh and also at

45
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,399
another point of view there is an

46
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,799
increased interest in peptide and other

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,039
protein protein based drugs such as the

48
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,479
monoclone antibodies nowadays the market

49
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,439
is increasing a lot and it's projected

50
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:10,280
to also increase in the next 10 years as

51
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,120
you can see from the right uh

52
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,200
plot and also they growing efforts to

53
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,879
increase the number of maps delivered as

54
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,400
subq injections instead of uh like IV

55
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,519
injections and there are multiple um

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,959
advantages in this uh subq

57
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,480
Administration through skin it's easily

58
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,080
self- administered by the patient uh of

59
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,040
course in improves patient compliance

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,519
and quality of life uh it comes with

61
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,599
decreased cost and a lower risk of

62
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:42,080
systemic infections as well so um

63
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,879
nowadays as you can see in the lower

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,440
plot um it is uh really used the sub

65
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:51,720
injection of these drugs however one of

66
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,400
the big issues is the vi vi availability

67
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,640
values that come with this subq

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,640
Administration can be very variable with

69
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,959
values from 50% actually I recently

70
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,000
found

71
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,440
25% uh all the way to 100 so that's

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,239
that's really a big Randomness so it

73
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,760
makes thre development uh more difficult

74
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,879
so here we come here is when this

75
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,519
Consortium comes and we're like okay

76
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,000
let's try to create to develop a

77
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,760
microphysiological system of human skin

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,560
vasculature that maybe could help

79
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,640
understanding better where is this

80
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,200
variability coming from and then like in

81
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,560
terms of the drug by distribution uh and

82
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,680
then hopefully uh help to try to predict

83
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,840
uh later on drug by

84
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,040
availability so um we have already held

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,760
uh many nice details from my colleague

86
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,760
about them these microphysiological

87
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,920
systems um these are nice in vitro

88
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,200
models that can replicate real organ

89
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,239
Form and Function they are based on

90
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,560
microfluidic Technologies they include

91
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,239
3D cell structure of multiple organ

92
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,319
specific cells like primary or iepc

93
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,360
cells

94
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,560
uh you can apply flow and you can mimic

95
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,360
the actual what's happening in the real

96
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,480
um tissue and also they can be used for

97
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,519
drug drug screening studies or you can

98
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,239
move to disease models with these as we

99
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,280
just saw with the brain disease

100
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,160
Alzheimer disase

101
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:24,360
model um yeah

102
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,120
so okay so as I said our goal was to

103
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,720
develop a microphysiological model to

104
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,560
study subc drug biodistribution so the

105
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,360
first step to that was okay how does

106
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,199
this subcu space look like and um the

107
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,320
subcu space is this uh hypodermis layer

108
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:43,199
of our skin uh it it it has uh blood

109
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,080
vessels lymphatic vessels adipocytes

110
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,600
everywhere uh and also ECM as well so

111
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,639
you have all these different 3D

112
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,400
compartments that we're trying to

113
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,720
replicate in our invitro system so we

114
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,680
want a model that we replicate this 3D

115
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,600
subc morphology we'll have enhanced

116
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,680
recapitulation of this complexities of

117
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,840
the envious tissue um will allow for

118
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,720
solid transport measurements across the

119
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,600
different compartments the different

120
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,680
blood and lymphatic endothelium for

121
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,280
example and then later on with these

122
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,000
measurements that we will get from the

123
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,680
different compartments um these data can

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,800
be informative on the drug by

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:25,360
distribution across the different um

126
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,759
structures so that's what we did um so

127
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,120
you have at this point you have he many

128
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,840
times what is our goal to develop this

129
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,319
micral iCal model of human skins vascul

130
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,120
for the subcu space uh but the main

131
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,440
thing that we wanted here for this

132
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,360
particular model is to have blood and

133
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,720
lymphatic vasculature at in the same

134
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,639
chip allowing for S inter signaling so

135
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,360
um in at least in our lab and actually

136
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,039
in general these invitra models have

137
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,039
usually only like blood vasculature

138
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,280
that's the most common thing so it's um

139
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,160
to my knowledge it's the first time that

140
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,639
we also combine blood and lymphatic

141
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,160
blure in one device so that was really

142
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,039
the challenge of this project uh so we

143
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,080
wanted to have these Mo these components

144
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:11,919
in our system blood microvasculature

145
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,319
lymphatic vessels adipocytes fiber

146
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,759
blasts and ECM in one device and you can

147
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:21,000
see in the center uh how our device

148
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,039
looks like uh we have this lengthy

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,319
compartment that has the blood uh

150
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,599
microvascular and then we have the

151
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:31,319
lymphatics lymphatic vessels uh and also

152
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:33,080
another compartment that has the ECM

153
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,199
where we actually introduce the drug for

154
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,759
measurements from ECM it goes to the

155
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,000
blood vascular and then lymphatic

156
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,759
vessels and we uh make various

157
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,759
measurements I'm going to talk about

158
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,400
right away um yeah so that's how it

159
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,000
looks like and also I'm want to mention

160
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,360
here that there are multiple open ports

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,960
where you can sample uh at any time any

162
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,680
time point of the experiment so that's

163
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,440
pretty nice because you can do all these

164
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:00,400
tests uh that Francesa just talk about

165
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,800
uh with all the different cell types

166
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,599
um so uh a couple of things of how we

167
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,720
develop this very briefly we start for

168
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:11,599
the blood vascul we start with dermal

169
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,039
primary dermal endothelial cells uh

170
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,199
primary dermal fiber Bloods and

171
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,440
adipocytes that we actually

172
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,240
differentiate from adus derived stem

173
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,919
cells in our lab it takes about three

174
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,400
weeks and then we combine these cells

175
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:26,240
with fibrinogen and we see these in this

176
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,120
compartment that you see um and then

177
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,639
after about four or five days these all

178
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,440
these cells self assemble into a very

179
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:37,599
nice perfusable 3D uh blood

180
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,919
microvascular uh and then once it's

181
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,960
perfusable I also incorporate add the

182
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,879
lymphatic the dermal primary lymphatics

183
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,720
uh in the system and then they also with

184
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,479
a specific application of flow they

185
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,639
create this nice Lumen so you can see

186
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,039
also lymphatic vasculature in the system

187
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,440
so the result is that we have an

188
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,840
integrated device with these different

189
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,000
compartments and now we are ready to

190
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,759
introduce our drug from this ECM

191
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,440
circular compartment that you see in

192
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,639
dark green and uh measure whatever we

193
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,240
want to do um so the first oh yeah I

194
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,360
forgot about that so I have showed you

195
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,360
um schematics but let's look at actual

196
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,960
images of our networks um you can see

197
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,159
how the blood vasculature looks likees

198
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,319
looks like uh this is St with lectin so

199
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:27,199
you see the AC ECS but you also can see

200
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,240
the adipo sites um and there also

201
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,560
fiberblast there as well and then you

202
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,399
can also see the lymphatic networks in

203
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,279
red um in the on the bottom image um and

204
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,640
then you can see another image on the

205
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,320
right that has uh both the blood

206
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,080
vasculature and the lymphatics and you

207
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,720
can see how these are close we didn't

208
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,200
want to have them all together for now

209
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,760
we start with the system because we want

210
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,560
to uh take different measurements like

211
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,240
separate measurements of the two but in

212
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,320
the same device we have low so all these

213
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,839
are interconnected pretty much the the

214
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,120
cells um um so we start uh our

215
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,360
measurements with the blood vasculature

216
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,079
we call this measurement blood

217
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,760
endothelial permeability this is

218
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:12,399
actually a technique that is well

219
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,839
established in our lab and pretty much

220
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,680
everyone is using so what we do is that

221
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,800
we need a conf focal and we are taking

222
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,880
images of our networks at a specific

223
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,600
time Point time Point Z let's say and

224
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,959
then after a couple of minutes usually

225
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,320
10 or so we take another image of the

226
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,800
same position so then we can compare the

227
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,800
permeability of the drug uh I forgot to

228
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,240
say that we have perused the vessels

229
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,360
with a drug um so that you can see how

230
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,640
much of this drug going outside to the

231
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,120
interal space from the vessels now in my

232
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,399
particular space because I'm doing the

233
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,600
skin it's a little bit opposite so

234
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,399
because it goes from the ECM to the

235
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,000
vessels so I try to replicate that

236
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,640
process so I actually have to Exon

237
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
everywhere like in the vessels and the

238
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,560
Matrix as well and then I peruse the

239
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,240
vessels with media which is black it's

240
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,920
not fluorescent so um the vessels clear

241
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,839
out so then I can measure how much of

242
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,680
the drag that is in the interstial space

243
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,600
comes into the vessel so that's a

244
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,880
measurement of the permeability from

245
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,600
Matrix to the vessels and um we have

246
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,880
actually started many experiments

247
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,920
experiments with our device and here you

248
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,399
can see all these drugs that we have

249
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,399
used and our results we do see a

250
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,720
molecular dependence which is pretty

251
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,720
nice and we think that this is a control

252
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,920
of that the system works um lower

253
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,079
molecular weight drugs

254
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,800
uh give higher permeability which makes

255
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,399
sense and it's also in agreement with

256
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,839
previous studies as well um so then we

257
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,279
also look at the role of the ECM in

258
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,000
terms of Matrix binding and diffusivity

259
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:47,000
for all these drugs we the technique we

260
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,040
used is called frap uh fluorescent

261
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,560
recovery after photo blitzing so photo

262
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,639
Blitz a specific spot in The Matrix and

263
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,880
then we see down the road like over time

264
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,360
how much uh of the diet goes into it

265
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,639
well uh and we measure the diffusivity

266
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,959
and the immobile fraction of various

267
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:07,720
drugs um also I have um done some other

268
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,800
measurements with a control device that

269
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,399
has no cells at all and a device that

270
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,279
has all the cells and uh in for the

271
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,399
diffusivity we don't necessarily see a

272
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:18,040
big difference but the immobile fraction

273
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,279
uh so it's a big difference and we think

274
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,079
that's a result of the of this

275
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,240
reorganization that the cells are

276
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,600
causing throughout the the whole week or

277
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,079
10 days that we have actually uh the

278
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,399
device going on and you can see also the

279
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,639
diffusivity and immobile uh measurements

280
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:38,720
for all again these different drugs that

281
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:42,320
we are using we uh do see a molecular

282
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,760
dependence uh which is also nice um and

283
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,800
we also all these values we're going to

284
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:50,320
test them um like correlate with other

285
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,000
um uh characteristics of these drugs as

286
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,560
well to see if there is a correlation so

287
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,720
that's how we're going to approach the

288
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,600
bi availability and bi distribution and

289
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,240
hopefully predict it in the future as

290
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,440
well um and also so the last measurement

291
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,279
we're doing right now is regarding the

292
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,320
lymphatic Network as well that is

293
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,880
growing in the integrated device um as

294
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,560
you probably many of you know the

295
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,360
lymphatics are a network of vessels that

296
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,600
serve as conduits for fluid protein and

297
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,480
cellular transport they regulate fluid

298
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,519
and osmotic pressure homeostasis in

299
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,240
tissues so they are really important as

300
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,079
well uh for drug absorption and uh

301
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,000
bioavailability so these are how the

302
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,800
lymphatics look like um and also I have

303
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,839
an orthogonal view here that you can see

304
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,720
actually that they are really 3D you can

305
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,800
see the lumens the

306
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,440
cross-sections um like this circular U

307
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,440
are they and they as we move they become

308
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,240
bigger so um what we do is that we

309
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,760
introduce the dexam from this circular

310
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,839
compartment and hopefully you remember

311
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,880
that uh in the device and then we

312
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:53,199
measure over time um the fluorescent of

313
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,079
the drug after the lymphatic so in a way

314
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:57,199
we measure the drainage rate of the

315
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:59,160
drugs uh for in the lymphatic

316
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:00,560
compartment so these are ongoing

317
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,760
experiment so this is the data that I

318
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,279
have right now but I'm running more and

319
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,160
more to get the whole panel of the drugs

320
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,760
that we tested for the others as well

321
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,399
for the

322
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,320
lymphatics um and with that uh I would

323
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,600
like to summarize my our work so we have

324
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,680
developed an integrated 3D model of this

325
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,760
human human skin vasculature for the

326
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,160
subcu space with blood and lymphatic

327
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,839
vasculature this skin model can now be

328
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,360
used for subcutanous delivery of

329
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:30,320
molecules and provides blood vasculature

330
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,120
lymphatic drainage and ECM measurements

331
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,279
and as I just said uh we hope to

332
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,320
colorate all these measurements for the

333
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:39,399
10 different drugs that we use with

334
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,760
known PK values for these drugs we

335
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,440
actually selected these drugs um having

336
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,000
that on our mind so they are really

337
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,680
heterogeneous one to one other like in

338
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,040
terms of bioavailability molecular

339
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,720
weight and other things uh in the future

340
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,839
we are going to do some single cell RNA

341
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,680
sequence I think it's pretty nice with

342
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,680
such a system complex system that you

343
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,920
have all these different cells uh

344
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,720
proteomics analysis as well H we also

345
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,959
probably that's not sure but we may add

346
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,279
also immune cells into the system um and

347
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:12,480
another idea could be to also as I said

348
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:15,199
we have many open compartments in this

349
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,040
system so that gives us the opportunity

350
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,959
to alternate a little bit the model so

351
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,320
maybe we can add an epidermis later

352
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,680
layer later on like

353
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,399
keratinocytes or we can use this model

354
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,279
to study human diseases uh as well uh I

355
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:32,079
really want to mention as well that my

356
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,160
collaborator in the project uh Dr sen

357
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,199
Kim have developed um a digital twin

358
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,880
model for this uh device so that's

359
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:42,600
that's pretty cool because we can

360
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,120
compare uh and then my experimental

361
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,800
measurements will inform this model

362
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,320
aiming for prediction of drug by

363
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,519
availability down the road which is our

364
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:55,240
main goal um and with that I would like

365
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,920
to thank you all thank you thanks to uh

366
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,040
my adviser Professor Roger C all my

367
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,959
collaborators uh um of course the

368
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,040
companies that fund this project and are

369
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,650
members of this wonderful Consortium um

370
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,759
thank you very

371
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:13,279
[Applause]

372
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:17,279
much thank you Maria for giving us that

373
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,279
overview any questions from the

374
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,639
audience thank you beautiful talk so can

375
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,160
you comment uh the possibility to

376
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,199
repurpose the SK model to cosmetic

377
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,959
applications yeah yeah that's a that's a

378
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,519
great application um that's a great

379
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,759
application I have actually thought a

380
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:41,959
lot about it uh you can you can use this

381
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:44,519
complex uh model for um investigating uh

382
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:47,040
many things in coneing or trying to find

383
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,720
new bioactives or something like that uh

384
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,079
I'm not sure if this particular

385
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,440
Consortium will go down the road on this

386
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:55,079
because it's funding by this big Pharma

387
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,040
companies I'm not sure if that's going

388
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:00,199
to be a goal for them but this can be

389
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,160
used definitely for for cosmetic uh

390
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:04,360
research as well that's a great idea

391
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,360
thank

392
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,519
you two in the back we'll come to one

393
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,279
and then the other thank you this is

394
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,720
this is great stuff um so maybe first do

395
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:20,839
you mind going back to slide nine you

396
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,480
had two I couldn't read from here sorry

397
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,399
uh you had two colors on the on the top

398
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,279
plot yeah uh the brown and the green

399
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,440
what are the difference between those uh

400
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:31,240
oh so these actually are plots from

401
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,000
other paper papers um I have included

402
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,800
the

403
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,560
citations um so these particular are

404
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,920
coming from different sources like they

405
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,920
are different cells so they have

406
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,480
Incorporated these as well these I think

407
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,120
the brown are huex and the green are

408
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,040
from animals um but the reason why I

409
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,000
have these plots here is to uh have an

410
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,639
idea of the permeability values that we

411
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,160
we get and to show that my system also

412
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,839
is very close to these values um but

413
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,480
yeah this is the difference in

414
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,240
and and uh maybe this is a question for

415
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:06,120
more more Downstream once once you have

416
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,319
a you know agreement with the digital

417
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:11,439
twin model um very excited to see what

418
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,600
happens with that but are you already

419
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,480
thinking about I don't know how the

420
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:17,880
Consortium governs the the licensing of

421
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,480
these uh MPS systems or how do you plan

422
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,959
to U sort of uh commercialize this or if

423
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,439
you plan to do that yeah so um yeah I

424
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,959
guess I forgot to say that we have

425
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,160
annual trainings for our member

426
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,039
companies we have already done two of

427
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,720
them and in actually two months they're

428
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:36,080
going to be another so all the member

429
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,720
companies come here at MIT and I

430
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,760
actually see together with their

431
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,080
representatives in the hood and I'm

432
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,120
teaching them how we develop the model

433
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,200
we got the microscope I'm doing all this

434
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,240
so they have access to everything we're

435
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,200
doing so they can actually recreate that

436
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,720
at their side so they already can do

437
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,760
that now this particular model though we

438
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,080
have separate systems with

439
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,840
commercialized M fluidics that they can

440
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,520
buy and they can do it but this model

441
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,000
model is a custom customized microle

442
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,799
device that they have developed we have

443
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,039
developed so they don't have access

444
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:10,280
right now but uh this is actually an

445
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:11,400
idea that a my advisor and actually

446
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,320
everyone is thinking about like

447
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:18,000
commercializing this device down the

448
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,000
road so every can can can buy it thank

449
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,720
you oh yeah thanks for the talk there

450
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,039
there's all kinds of organoids that seem

451
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,960
to be limited by the lack of a

452
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:28,960
vasculature like there' be a neural

453
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,280
organoid or an embryo model or you know

454
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,799
any kind of number of organoids that can

455
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,080
only grow so far so long because they

456
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:36,799
don't have a vascular so does this does

457
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,280
this system in any way uh could it be

458
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,080
generalized to these other organoids to

459
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,440
allow them to you know have a blood

460
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,480
supply yeah I think so and actually I

461
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,320
think our lab is a great example because

462
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,520
uh pretty much all the models we have

463
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,520
have a blood

464
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,320
vasculature um so yeah I think uh you

465
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,679
can grow a blood vascular it takes more

466
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,799
time than just a monol layer of cells uh

467
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,760
but I think it can be Incorporated in

468
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:05,760
many system many systems depending on

469
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,760
the organ you want to

470
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,679
test sorry I'm just interested in your

471
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,480
data here why do you think the V EGF m m

472
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,679
doesn't follow the size rule or my the

473
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,000
Bea SZ M why the permeability is quite

474
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,919
High there sorry which one did you say

475
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,080
the one the large molecule your far

476
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:33,120
right the VF an body

477
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,320
bmab just quite High permeability

478
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,760
despite being okay so this is again uh

479
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,600
from another

480
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,600
study um yeah maybe I mention that

481
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,720
better but yeah so these are from other

482
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,360
studies like um that have been done in

483
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,960
the past so for this particular one I

484
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,480
have never tested the my results are

485
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,799
this main plot here so um I'm not really

486
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,840
sure as I haven't tested why this has a

487
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:01,200
higher permeability that could be due to

488
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,679
many reasons like I don't know nonp

489
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,720
specific endocytosis maybe could be one

490
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,360
or others um yeah I guess I'm not sure

491
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,760
about that since I haven't tested that

492
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,760
problem thanks
