1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,920
Okay, good morning everyone and good

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,920
afternoon and good evening for those of

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,880
you who are joining uh via live stream

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,199
remotely from other regions. Uh this is

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,640
Mickey Kato uh program director at

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:26,080
office of corporate relation OCR. Uh

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,960
today I am a host of this health science

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,920
forum together with my colleague program

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,200
data Sher. Sher please stand up say

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,920
hello. Thank

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:41,200
you. Okay. And

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,320
uh as you may know this is a landmark of

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,840
uh located at Kendall Square. I'll

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,320
briefly explain about this unique MIT

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,559
innovation ecosystem.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,719
There are five important element on this

17
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:59,359
ecosystem. As you can see our OEARD

18
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,800
office of cooperative relations connect

19
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,720
university which is MIT and

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,280
entrepreneurs which is uh MIT startup

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,680
exchange program member startups and

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,880
large corporation which is ILP member

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,000
company

24
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:20,080
together and MIT has five school and one

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,680
college and life science research uh

26
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,200
intensively uh research at various uh

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,119
department and schools. For example, at

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,400
the school of science, department of

29
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,880
chemistry and the department of biology

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,880
and school of engineering, a department

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,400
of chemical engineering and department

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,000
of biological engineering and

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,799
electronical ECS, electronic engineering

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,399
and computer science and Schwartzman

35
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,320
College of Computing. uh we have uh

36
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,759
computer science and artificial

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,320
intelligent lab which is called

38
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,719
Cale and media lab at school of

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,960
architecture and planning. This is just

40
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,799
an example that many researcher

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,239
conducted broadly at

42
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:10,720
MIT. So MIT campus exist over 65

43
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,160
research laboratory and centers and

44
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,959
programs. Many are life science related.

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,000
About $840 million sponsored

46
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:25,120
research research expenditures and about

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,400
20% come from industry including a

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,920
member company and many patent filings

49
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,800
every year. MIT was ranked number two in

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,360
the US university patent granted uh last

51
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,640
year. Uh this ecosystem uniqueness is

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,000
shown in this map. Uh as you can see

53
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,440
everything is uh located in walking

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,440
distance. You can see uh red color

55
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,400
circle. The largest circle is 15 minutes

56
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,080
walking distance from MIT dome. If you

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,760
not try please walk you can do

58
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,120
it. So it's very convenient everything

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,560
connected tightly. And another aspect

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,720
you can see this pink color name shown

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,599
here. There are many uh located life

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,080
science related companies in this area.

63
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:19,560
Not only large corporation but also uh

64
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:23,040
startups. This is a ILP member

65
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:27,800
portfolio. Over 200 large corporation

66
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:33,120
are ILP member. Now 30% North America,

67
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:36,080
20% Europe and 40% Asia and Pacific. As

68
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,519
you can see there are many life science

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,360
related IP member companies. uh today we

70
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,400
invite uh member candidate company as

71
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,680

join uh please contact to each regional

73
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,080
program directors. So program directors

74
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,480
uh please stand up uh only sharing now

75
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,319

startups are registered as of today and

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,639
many are life science related. Today the

85
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,360
presenter we invite uh four startup for

86
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,000

startup at the poster

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,360
session. Uh today health science forum

89
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,680
uh covers broad scope of category.

90
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,080
