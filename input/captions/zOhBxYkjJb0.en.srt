00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,319
hey everyone my name is Paul Bosco head

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,080
of product at project

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:13,200
us. the AI that makes us

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,359
better are you a chess player AI can

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,000
outplay you are you a web developer AI

6
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:22,680
can do a week's worth of coding in

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,400
nearly 45 seconds yes AI is fast cheap

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,400
and quite good at nearly any

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,439
job but are we asking the right

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,480
questions What If instead of asking how

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,600
AI is better than us we ask how AI can

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,840
make us

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,680
better emerging from the MIT media lab

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,200
project US is an AI system designed to

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,200
help make us humans the best versions of

16
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:53,239
ourselves so how does it work project us

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,879
sits in the background of any virtual

18
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,519
meeting it ingests a broad range of Bio

19
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,719
signals including word choice body

20
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:02,879
language breathing and heart rate

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,920
the system continually learns about you

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,600
and provides ongoing feedback on your

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,680
behaviors and as we improve individually

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,400
the organizations we work with become

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,920
more cohesive creative and

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,240
productive so where are we today in

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,280
20123 we spun out from the MIT media lab

28
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,520
we raised our first round of funding and

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,960
oversubscribed our round we're now

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,560
partnering with over 10 organizations to

31
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,560
help support their talent development

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,560
initiatives

33
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:35,240
meet Julie a chief executive at one of

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,240
these client companies Julie's been

35
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,399
using project US during her day-to-day

36
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,320
meetings to help support track and

37
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:44,880
identify Target

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,560
behaviors after just one month of usage

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,040
on the product we observed a 32%

40
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,040
increase in these targeted

41
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,240
behaviors and this data can be

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,000
anonymized and aggregated to help

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,640
organizations understand the real

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,079
challenges faced by their teams and best

45
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,759
of all this data doesn't come from a

46
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,799
poll survey it's not self-reported it's

47
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,799
real quantitative data from your team

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,720
interactions it's been an honor to help

49
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,640
grow this company with my friends and

50
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,160
colleagues and to be recognized by some

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,440
of the leading organizations in the

52
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:24,000
world such as the UN Nvidia uh and the

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,720
NSF so now we're looking to partner with

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,680
organizations we're sector agnostic we

55
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,120
can work with truly any sized company

56
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,120
and we can deploy in almost any

57
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,080
environment we're looking for companies

58
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,560
to form strategic Partnerships and to

59
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,920
deploy Pilots if you're interested stop
