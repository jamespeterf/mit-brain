1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,319
good afternoon everybody it's great to

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,320
be here I'm Sid proein

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:12,559
M90 and I'm a firsttime CEO I've uh been

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,240
CTO for many Ventures and I think the

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,119
key thing I've I've Loved about it is

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,960
bringing together data from multiple

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:20,199
sources in fact I my first job was at

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,519
John Hancock Financial Services put

9
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:23,560
together a database of 12 uh different

10
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,720
product lines that have been separate

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,279
for 100 years and the insights we

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,199
produced were amazing that pattern is

13
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:32,160
one that really continues and what I'm

14
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,360
here to tell you about is swirl for the

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,239
Enterprise helping turn that painful day

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,879
to scavenger hunt where you spend time

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,600
going from tab to tab saving stuff

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,360
rewriting it organizing it that

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,680
scavenger hunt is AI is going to end it

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,440
we're going to get answers and insights

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,079
and the key is AI infrastructure

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,520
software let's take a step back you

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,559
might have heard a lot about the death

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,440
of AI or seen articles about how we're

25
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:57,920
in the trough of disillusionment it's

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,160
very hard to make it work the problem is

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,320
that most AI Solutions want your data

28
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,320
they want you to copy it in now if you

29
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,320
have just a single Silo of data for your

30
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,080
application that's pretty

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,240
straightforward but if you have a data

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,560
sprawl like the large Enterprise if you

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,360
have a data sprawl like the large

34
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,280
Enterprise it's very very impractical

35
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,880
there are security issues there are

36
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,079
compliance issues and actually those

37
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,680
Loom a bit larger and there's always the

38
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,280
question of resources do we really need

39
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,520
to copy nine pedabytes of data how

40
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,920
expensive is that going to be the answer

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,280
is about a million and a half dollars

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,759
swirl is AI INF infrastructure software

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,280
you install it in your environment it's

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,680
not a hosted service you can deploy it

45
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,759
anywhere Edge uh your own networks your

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,560
any cloud provider it provides a secure

47
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,439
connection between your choice of AI and

48
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,880
your backend data sources uses your uh

49
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,280
integrates with your single sign on so

50
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,399
there's no new uh permissioning of data

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,840
there's no bulk copying and it actually

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,159
gives you the power to turn an AI into

53
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,479
an assistant what does a conversation

54
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,000
with your data look like and why would

55
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,840
you want one the answer is it saves a

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,960
huge amount of time and it follows the

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,599
very natural process of being

58
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,560
interrupted by questions right and one

59
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,599
question needs to another so I got a

60
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,319
question recently what do we have for

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,400
cyber insurance I asked swirl and by the

62
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,560
way you could do this with a UI an API

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,319
or Microsoft teams or slack one of the

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,599
great things about AI is it's Omni

65
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,040
channel so after I clarified some

66
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,120
questions about my intent I was trying

67
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,640
to find swirls policy less than a minute

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,120
later in total I got the answer this was

69
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,319
open AI gp4 via swirls rag against as

70
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,400
you can see my one drive or SharePoint

71
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:43,480
not only do I have the answers but I

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,920
have the citations so I can verify that

73
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,599
this is correct and these insights are

74
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,560
personal I'm the only person in swirl

75
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,159
who can see this right because I happen

76
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,159
to have this document was sent to me and

77
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:55,879
I purchased the policy swirl produces

78
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,840
personalized

79
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,200
