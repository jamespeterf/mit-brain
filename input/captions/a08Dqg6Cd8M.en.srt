1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,639
Hello everyone. Uh my name is Dina

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,040
Kitabi. I'm professor at MIT. Um I'm

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,160
very happy to welcome you here at this

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,720
conference. I just before getting into

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,439
the technical material I uh I just

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,519
walked from the main campus uh here and

7
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,199
of course I noticed the protesters

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,920
outside

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,880
and I don't know which companies are

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,360
involved in this conference but I want

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,280
to emphasize one very important thing to

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,120
me and all the researchers who worked on

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,280
this project is that we insist that

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,920
everything that we do is for helping

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,239
people particularly in healthcare act

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,320
and these invisible technology are not

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,320
used to harm people in any way.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,199
Thank you very much. So now let's let's

19
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,840
get to the technical material.

20
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,600
So as you can see from the title of my

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,320
talk, beyond wearables, the rise of

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,040
invisible health tech. Now I want to ask

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,400
you by show of hand, who is wearing

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,640
wearable in this audience?

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,720
Okay, like significant subset. Now I

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,200
want you to look at each other. Look at

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:30,080
my audience here and what do you see? I

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,759
can tell you what I see. Healthy people

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,640
mainly like everything here looks great.

30
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,759
You guys are not the problem of our

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,720
health care system or health care like

32
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,920
in any modern society. You are taking

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,720
care of yourself. you are like trying

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,640
your best to like follow your health

35
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,240
through wearables and variety of things.

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,479
He is the reason why our health care

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,360
systems have to pay about $5 trillion on

38
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,719
healthcare. This is my grandfather.

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,360
He's old and sick. He passed away now.

40
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,840
But it is people like him who are like

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,959
that we need to take care of. And people

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,879
like him don't wear wearables.

43
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,120
In fact, there are many studies that

44
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,680
show even people like us, even you guys

45
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,480
who are wearing the wearables, like when

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,239
people are feeling sick and like really

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,560
unhealthy, they stop wearing the

48
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,120
wearables. The last thing on one's mind

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,959
is that I'm really sick today. I have to

50
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,720
wear my Apple Watch and by the way, I

51
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,640
have also two charges to make sure that

52
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,760
the data is there. So how can we monitor

53
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,440
the health of the old and the sick the

54
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,840
people who really need health

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,680
monitoring? That's is the question that

56
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,519
we ask. Now imagine with me if there is

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,680
something a device that looks very much

58
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,080
like your Wi-Fi box that sits in the

59
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,400
background of the home and analyzes the

60
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,319
wireless signal that bounce off people

61
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,640
bodies and be able from that to get your

62
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,400
breathing, your heartbeat. When you

63
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,319
sleep, it knows that you are sleeping

64
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,560
and it knows like the difference between

65
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,760
REM when you dream versus like sleep

66
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,760
versus deep sleep. It can monitor motion

67
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,640
and even EEG even the brain waves that

68
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,560
uh follow the the the evolution of the

69
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,879
uh of the u nervous system. It can do

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,239
that and from that it can get biomarkers

71
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,879
of diseases and drugs.

72
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,200
That might sound science fiction, but

73
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,360
this is exactly what we do. We have a

74
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,760
device that we call the Emerald device,

75
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,599
and it can do all of that stuff because

76
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,560
you guys, as you are sitting here, you

77
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,200
are swimming in a sea of wireless

78
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,840
signal. All of those electromagnetic

79
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,640
waves as they bounce of your bodies,

80
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,519
they carry information about the pulsing

81
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,480
of your blood, your respiration, your

82
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,519
movements, and even indirectly about

83
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,280
what's happening inside your brain. And

84
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,560
AI can extract with the proper custom

85
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,200
neural network can extract many of these

86
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,680
pieces of information. So I'm going to

87
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,760
show you a few demos and I'm going to

88
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,479
start from one of the earliest result

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,479
that we have here. So this is one of our

90
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,320
offices. You see one of my students

91
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,240
standing here. Now the device is not

92
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,720
even in the same office. It's going to

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,360
monitor him from behind the wall. You

94
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,000
see a red dot on the side. Now I play

95
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,800
this for you and you can see as he walks

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,840
the red dot is tracking his movements.

97
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,240
He doesn't have wearables on his body.

98
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,759
It's purely because we analyze the

99
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,400
wireless signal as it bounce on his body

100
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,520
as he moves without any wearables, no

101
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,199
cell phone, nothing.

102
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,120
Okay? And everything that I show you

103
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,600
today is quite accurate. It's compared

104
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,360
to the gold standard for measuring that

105
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,040
physiological signal and we have

106
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,960
multiple publication that I encourage

107
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,960
you to look at. So I told you that this

108
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,240
is one of our earlier results. Let me

109
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:11,120
show you what we can get today. So you

110
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,759
can see these like skeletal figures. So

111
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,479
we can get this is what the wireless

112
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,639
device get the full stick figure of how

113
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,800
the person is moving and what you see on

114
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,880
the side are the people inside the room

115
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,280
just for you so that you can see what is

116
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,520
happening. So when I play this he's no

117
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,840
longer a dot on the floor map. You can

118
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,759
see that he's sitting. When he stand up

119
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,440
you can see that he's standing up. when

120
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,759
he moves with the right foot, you see

121
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,400
the right foot, it's the left foot. So,

122
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,360
we can monitor these stick figures in

123
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,479
the home. If somebody who has like motor

124
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,199
symptoms like in Parkinson's, inexia,

125
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:51,360
an Alzheimer patient who forgot what he

126
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:54,240
did today. So, we can have continuous

127
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,240
monitoring of what people have as stick

128
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,919
figures without looking at details of

129
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,080
what they are, how they are dressed and

130
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,560
all of that stuff. And again, everything

131
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,319
that I'm showing you here is compared to

132
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,120
the gold standard showing that it is

133
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,919
highly accurate. Motion is not the only

134
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,160
thing that we can get. When you go to

135
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,960
sleep, your brain waves change and you

136
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,759
enter different stages. Awake, light

137
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,520
sleep, deep sleep, and REM, rapid eye

138
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,600
movements, which is the stage in which

139
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,560
you dream.

140
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,360
These sleep stages are important for any

141
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,840
like person who has sleep disorder. But

142
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,080
actually sleep is a platform for almost

143
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,400
all diseases. You name it from Alzheimer

144
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,240
to depression to everything. So if you

145
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,720
want to understand diseases, we need to

146
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,199
understand sleep at a deep level. Today

147
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,440
if you want accurate sleep staging, you

148
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,000
send someone to a sleep lab. This is the

149
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,720
MGH sleep lab. And you can see what

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,199
happens to those people.

151
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,120
You can see he's not happy.

152
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,600
So they ask you to sleep like this. Let

153
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,560
me show you what we do.

154
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,479
So this is our device transmit very low

155
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,960
power wireless signal analyzes the

156
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,520
reflection using AI

157
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,440
and spits out sleep staging. This is

158
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,039
something called the hypnogoggram. It

159
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,440
tells you how the brain is moving

160
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,840
between different sleep stages from

161
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,479
awake to light sleep to deep sleep to

162
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,400
REM and again and with sleep cycles. As

163
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,240
you can see this is what you get when

164
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,120
you send someone to the sleep lab at

165
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,599
MGH. And we can get it as you can see as

166
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,400
a person sleeping in their home without

167
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,919
anything on their body. And sorry let me

168
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,680
just go back and we have many

169
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,680
publication that compare it to the gold

170
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,840
standard. Now I know many of you for

171
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,479
example may not be getting like sleep

172
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,120
like from URA or from uh the Apple

173
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,160
Watch. In fact our results show that

174
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,639
this is more accurate and achieve higher

175
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,639
accuracy than the wearables

176
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,639
at least for the one that publish

177
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,759
results on on their performance. Of

178
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,639
course, there are many that we don't

179
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,400
even know what's the the accuracy.

180
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,960
Okay. So, this person is sitting like

181
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,440
you. What you see on the screen is his

182
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,560
inhales, exhales,

183
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,639
and uh we told him to hold his breath.

184
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,280
So, stop breathing. And you can see the

185
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,960
signal stays at a steady level because

186
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,960
he exhaled and he did not inhale.

187
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,039
Again, everything is compared to the

188
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,240
gold standard FDA approved devices. I

189
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,639
want to show you the most recent uh

190
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,759
result that I'm very very excited about

191
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,319
which is EEG the brain waves and here

192
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,640
I'm showing you an example. So this is

193
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,479
the EEG but during sleep. This is not

194
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,800
the EEG when you are thinking about a

195
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,599
particular problem but this is the EEG

196
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,159
during sleep. It is uh you can see the

197
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,880
ground truth EEG of the person. The

198
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,080
first row this is an Alzheimer patient.

199
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,839
He's a male 83 years old and you can see

200
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,240
the AI generated EEG for him with our

201
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,120
neural networks.

202
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,600
Quite accurate isn't it? But I mean this

203
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,279
is one person. We have repeated these

204
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,240
results for 20 20,000 different

205
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,800
individuals and with mean error that is

206
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,800
less than 7%.

207
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,720
Now once you have data about like

208
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,200
physiological signals you can start

209
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,800
asking questions about diseases and

210
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,480
drugs. So for example, what you see here

211
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,480
is uh the first result is can we detect

212
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,720
Parkinson from just like the the the

213
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,959
wireless signal and the breathing of

214
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,440
someone during their sleep and you can

215
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,000
see like very high accuracy. This is

216
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,320
published in nature medicine and today

217
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,320
we are working on other diseases like

218
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,279
Alzheimer and you can see our results

219
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,200
already from one night of sleep that

220
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,839
could be obtained purely from the

221
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,519
wireless signal we get like about 80%

222
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,920
accuracy on detecting whether someone

223
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,760
has Alzheimer or not and what's very

224
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,959
interesting to me also because we are

225
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,120
facing a pandemic of mental health we

226
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,760
can actually detect anti-depressant

227
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,399
effect on people so today mental health

228
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,040
is something that we don't have very

229
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,800
concrete and objective measure. We ask

230
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,920
people how do you feel? Now we give them

231
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,079
a drug. How do you feel? But imagine if

232
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,160
we can actually measure the change that

233
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,680
anti-depressant have and from that

234
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,920
detect whether somebody is taking

235
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,720
anti-depressent or not and that's the

236
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,360
last A-axis you can interpret it as

237
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,920
accuracy. A is interpretable as

238
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,160
accuracy.

239
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,040
I want to say a few words about how it

240
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,600
works and I'm going to use EEG as an

241
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,640
example and this is very very high

242
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,320
level. Okay, I want to remind you of

243
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:49,279
something that you all know like uh gen

244
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,920
AI for text and images. So you know

245
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,519
today that you can give a generative

246
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,920
model uh a a text prompt and it can

247
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,240
generate an image for you. Daddy for

248
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,640
example would do this. So you can say oh

249
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,360
generate for me the an image of a corgi

250
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,600
playing a trumpet and I will generate

251
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,000
that for you. Now the thing that you

252
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,120
have to notice in these gen AIs is that

253
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
there is consistency between the text

254
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,800
and the image that is generated. How can

255
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,920
we use that to generate physiological

256
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,760
signals? So here's what we do again at a

257
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,920
high level. So we say instead of prompt

258
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,680
that come from text now we can take the

259
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,200
prompt from the wireless signal that

260
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,640
bounce off someone and say look I want

261
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,399
you to generate the EEG for this person

262
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,959
given that this is a wireless signal

263
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:45,880
that bounce of their body and it can

264
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,880
generate the EEG for them.

265
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,600
So as we are speaking here these emerald

266
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,240
devices are used with real patients in

267
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,200
real clinical trials. We are deployed

268
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:04,560
with patients who have Parkinson disease

269
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:08,320
Alzheimer ALS Crohn's lupus FSHD

270
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:12,079
syndrome etc and also depression or

271
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,720
mental uh issues.

272
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,720
So I want to show you quickly two

273
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,120
results that are more related to

274
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,600
diseases and drugs like what we call

275
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,920
biomarkers for diseases biomarkers for

276
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,480
drugs. So I'm sure all of you guys have

277
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,959
heard of the disease Parkinson's correct

278
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,160
I mean Parkinson is a neurogenerative

279
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,560
disease. It is the fastest growing

280
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,880
neurodeenerative disease in the world.

281
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,399
It is the second most common

282
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,519
neurodeenerative disease after Alzheimer

283
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,839
and what happens uh is uh basically we

284
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,800
notice Parkinson typically today due to

285
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,600
the tremor and the stiffness of motion

286
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,120
and but the problem is that by the time

287
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,160
someone get tremor and stiffness the

288
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,880
disease has started already 10 years ago

289
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,680
in their brain and the neurons the

290
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,399
dopamineergic neurons are responsible

291
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,519
for parking Parkinson disease already 50

292
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,000
to 80% damaged. So by the time these

293
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,120
motor symptoms appear the the neurons

294
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,279
are 80% damaged. So what can we do? How

295
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,920
can we like this is very late to detect

296
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,560
a disease. So what we wanted to do is to

297
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,880
detect the disease without any motor

298
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,360
symptoms without any tremor without any

299
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,839
stiffness. When people sleep all of that

300
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,360
stuff disappears.

301
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,079
So can we detect Parkinson just from the

302
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,320
breathing of someone?

303
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,160
And what we did is we took the

304
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,920
respiratory signal. We know that we can

305
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,560
get this very easily from wireless

306
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,639
signal in in the in just like a device

307
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,200
that looks like Wi-Fi box in the home of

308
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,839
the person. We uh designed a neural

309
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,000
network that answer two question. Does

310
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,079
this person have Parkinson disease? And

311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,839
if they do, what is the severity of

312
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:02,680
their disease according to the gold

313
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,680
standard? Let me show you the results.

314
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,720
So this is something called the rock

315
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,199
curve. If you haven't seen this style of

316
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,760
curves before, not important. The

317
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,079
important number is that AU there. So

318
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,240
this curve has specificity on one axis,

319
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,839
sensitivity on the other axis, but the

320
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,639
AU you can interpret it as accuracy. So

321
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,000
this shows you that from one night a

322
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:31,040
forless signal with an accuracy that is

323
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,360
about 90% I can tell whether this person

324
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,560
has Parkinson's or not. No questions

325
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,399
asked, no movements, nothing. And it's

326
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,920
not just about the wireless signal, but

327
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,000
what's good about the wireless signal is

328
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,320
that it gives me respiratory signal very

329
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,639
accurately. But I can also like if I put

330
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,720
a breathing belt on them, I can do the

331
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,800
same thing and detect from that whether

332
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,680
they have Parkinson's or not. Now this

333
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,600
is very important because no like med

334
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,360
medical expert today can look at

335
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,639
someone's breathing and say oh they have

336
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,320
Parkinson's no they don't have

337
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:05,360
Parkinson's we don't have that ability

338
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,160
so we can push medicine to a new level

339
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,399
and now the natural question to ask okay

340
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,440
can I actually detect Parkinson before

341
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,839
it is diagnosed by a doctor now of

342
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,440
course for this uh study like the other

343
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,839
study here we had uh you see we had

344
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,519
about 7,000 individuals. This is a very

345
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,000
large study that we show that it's we

346
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,760
are very accurate. But of course, like

347
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,839
studying whether somebody is going to

348
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,839
develop Parkinson later, that's much

349
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,800
harder. How are you going to find people

350
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,279
who eventually developed Parkinson's? So

351
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,519
we we found a data set that has

352
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:44,079
respiratory signal on two visits and uh

353
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,560
in the first visit people came they we

354
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,480
they recorded their respiratory signal

355
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,720
and their sleep. on the second visit

356
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,199
that happened six years later they came

357
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,759
again and a small subset of those people

358
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,160
when they came again they said now I was

359
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,360
diagnosed by Parkinson so they were not

360
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,759
diagnosed by park with Parkinson uh in

361
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,399
in the early visit but six years later

362
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,240
they came and they had a diagnosis of

363
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,560
Parkinson so we don't know exactly when

364
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,240
they got diagnosed but in like later

365
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,480
than this first uh visit so we looked at

366
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,240
the first visit when they did not have

367
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,399
Parkinson or at least they were not

368
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,199
diagnosed. And these are the blue guys.

369
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,800
So you see the orange line like the the

370
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,320
machine learning already is saying look

371
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,240
this these blue guys are very different

372
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,240
from the red guys who never developed

373
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,759
Parkinson's. I think actually they

374
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,000
already have Parkinson's.

375
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,839
So of course this is an initial results

376
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,480
we need to get like in medicine you

377
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,959
really want to have a large data set and

378
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,639
repeat these results to be sure like

379
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,120
about the specificity and the

380
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,519
sensitivity. But this is very promising.

381
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,399
It's telling us that we can screen very

382
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,399
easily from thin air for who is going to

383
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,399
have tendency toward developing

384
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,399
Parkinson's.

385
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,160
Mental health is very important and one

386
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,480
of the issues with uh mental health is

387
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,199
like for example in depression of course

388
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,199
anti-depressant are prescribed but many

389
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,280
people are non-adherent with their

390
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,720
anti-depressant or after some time like

391
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,480
they take the anti-depressant and they

392
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,039
think that they are fine so they stop

393
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,400
taking it and that causes relapses and

394
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,720
in some cases actually suicide.

395
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,480
So it's very important to make sure that

396
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,960
people are adherent with their

397
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,320
anti-depressant. Now if you are going to

398
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,160
to ask someone who just like decided not

399
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,039
to take their anti-depressant are you

400
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,120
taking it mean they might say yes I mean

401
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,120
just I mean basically non-adherent

402
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,039
people and they decided not to be

403
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,960
adherent or they are not adherent for

404
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,600
some reason. So ideally you want to have

405
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,919
a test that is very easy that can tell

406
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,160
the doctor okay pay attention to this

407
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,559
patient remind them check on them

408
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,160
because that is dangerous if somebody

409
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,080
particularly severe cases who are

410
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,880
suicidal

411
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,840
so how can we check so I want to remind

412
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,400
you of that hypnogog the sleep so this

413
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,480
is the sleep in a normal person and I'm

414
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,280
going to use this to explain to you like

415
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,200
how sleep is changes when somebody takes

416
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,200
anti-depressant so this person is not

417
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,840
taking anti-depressant and you see on

418
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,080
the x-axis is time on the y-axis is the

419
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,080
sleep stage. Uh this person went to

420
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,120
sleep slightly before midnight. This is

421
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,679
sleep onset. He moved to light sleep and

422
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,760
then he moved to deep sleep and then REM

423
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,840
which is the stage in which we dream.

424
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,880
Now I'm sure you heard that sleeps

425
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,600
happens in cycles. So every cycle either

426
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,960
end with REM or with the person being

427
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,960
awake. So here you see four cycles. The

428
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,400
first three ended with RAM. The last one

429
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,600
ended with a person waking up.

430
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,919
So let me show you how sleep looks in a

431
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,160
person particularly how RAM like for

432
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,120
example here if we just look at the RAM

433
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,559
and we set everything else to zero just

434
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,880
look at the RAM architecture and I stack

435
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,919
many nice one after other one after

436
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,120
other and let me show you what happens.

437
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,520
So here is how this this is in a person

438
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,440
who is not taking anti-depressant. So on

439
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,080
the x- axis zero means sleep onset and

440
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,559
the x-axis is time since sleep onset

441
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,760
since they went to sleep and on the y

442
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,760
ais is many days and nights st st st st

443
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:23,840
st st st st st st st st st st st st st

444
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,480
st st st st st st st st st st st st st

445
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,200
st st st st st st st st st st stacked on

446
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,080
top of each other zero means no RAM any

447
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,559
color that you see means RAM okay so

448
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,559
what do you see you see something very

449
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,559
much like the sleep architecture like

450
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,120
there are cycles and the cycles are

451
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,720
ending with RAM but the last cycle the

452
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,480
person can wake up so not nec

453
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,880
necessarily that it ends with RAM.

454
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,039
So this is what we know about people who

455
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,799
don't take anti-depressant. Now let me

456
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,720
show you an example of a person who

457
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,880
takes anti-depressant.

458
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,720
So without even me telling you what's

459
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,840
going on, I mean immediately it's very

460
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,559
obvious that the first REM cycle got

461
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,039
knocked off.

462
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,960
But this is requires us to put so many

463
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,080
nights and stack them on top of each

464
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,080
other. So now we can go and say okay AI

465
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,280
can you help us can you actually from

466
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,360
one night tell me whether the person is

467
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,000
taking on their anti-depressant or not

468
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,240
so that I as a physician I can react

469
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,520
quickly I don't waste six months to

470
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,520
figure out that they are not taking

471
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,320
their anti-depressant

472
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,320
and so what we did we took respiratory

473
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,960
signal again and that could come from

474
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,200
the wagless signal from thin air in the

475
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,440
person's home but also could come from

476
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,159
breathing belt I mean that's The point

477
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,600
is to be able to get correct respiration

478
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,880
and then we transform this like we have

479
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,440
LLM inspired model that give us an EEG

480
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,760
representation and from that we can ask

481
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,640
is this person taking anti-depressant or

482
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,360
not

483
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,039
and here is the result. So this is again

484
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,120
similar to the curve that I showed you

485
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,280
before on the x-axis specificity

486
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,840
sensitivity again the number that you

487
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,799
have to worry about is the AU from a

488
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,799
single night of data I can tell from

489
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,799
thin air from the wireless whether this

490
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,960
person is taking their anti-depressant

491
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,880
or not

492
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:22,000
with an accuracy that is 84%.

493
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,520
Now let me show you two example. One

494
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,960
person who was not taking

495
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,799
anti-depressant and started

496
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,200
anti-depressant in the middle of the

497
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,039
first figure and another person who was

498
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,039
on anti-depressant but the doctor

499
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,280
started tapering their anti-depressant

500
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,159
so taking them off the anti-depressant

501
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,120
and you can very clearly see that the

502
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,919
the on the yaxis is the the score from

503
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,960
our AI model and you can tell that the

504
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,360
model is able to detect when a person

505
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,600
started taking the anti-depressant and

506
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,600
when the other person was tapering in

507
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,320
the anti-depressant

508
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,280
and that is allow us as I said earlier

509
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,760
50% of patients have adherence problems

510
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,880
and in the worst case it can end up in

511
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,280
suicide but also even when it hopefully

512
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,360
doesn't end up that way but it has a

513
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,120
risk of relapsing to depression and

514
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,880
hospitalization

515
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,640
and this can help doctor monitor that

516
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:22,799
I want to end with our vision basically

517
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:26,080
today we all use and are very familiar

518
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:29,120
and but foundational model of text and

519
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,240
images. So I'm sure all of you use like

520
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,960
chat GPT the GPT model is foundational

521
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,760
model of text and you use probably Deli

522
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,240
and Sora and many of these models that

523
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,400
try to incorporate also images and

524
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:47,919
different modalities. So what we want in

525
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,880
my group in my lab what we design now

526
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,600
foundational model for human physiology

527
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,200
imagine if we have models that can

528
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:00,720
actually understand EEG understand

529
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,440
respiratory signal understand uh like uh

530
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,440
pulsing understand all of that stuff on

531
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,360
their own it's not about like just

532
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,600
looking at what the medical literature

533
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,000
tell them because the medical literature

534
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,799
tells us only about what doctors already

535
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,640
know. But I just showed you things that

536
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,600
doctors don't know. Doctors don't know

537
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,640
how to extract from breathing whether

538
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,960
somebody has uh Parkinson's or not. They

539
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,440
don't know whether like someone from

540
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,600
their respiratory signal also whether

541
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,480
they are like taking anti-depressant or

542
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,320
not. So this new foundation model will

543
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,320
push the limit the envelope of our

544
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,600
understanding of medicine and cannot be

545
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,000
taught just from textbook on medical

546
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,200
stuff. It has be it has to be taught

547
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,080
directly from our physiological signals

548
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,240
and a foundation model that for human

549
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,640
physiology means a model that can

550
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,799
understand our physiological signals so

551
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,960
that with a small tuning its

552
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:01,600
representation can be used for many

553
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,480
tasks. the same way as you use like chat

554
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,159
GPT not just for generating poetry but

555
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:11,520
for legal stuff and you can use it for

556
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,360
uh like uh mass you can use it for code

557
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,640
so it applies to so many different

558
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,200
domains so can we have a physiological

559
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,919
foundation model that looks at a human

560
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,720
physiology and can be used for many

561
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:28,400
downstream tasks like for Parkinson for

562
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,440
Alzheimer for ALS for CHF for uh

563
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,919
anti-depressant for anticolinergic and

564
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,720
we are working on this model. We have

565
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,279
very promising initial results that show

566
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,919
us that we can actually apply this model

567
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,080
and achieve high accuracy on so many

568
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,559
tasks that span neurological,

569
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,159
respiratory, cardiovascular and

570
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,039
metabolic.

571
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,760
And with that I want to leave you with

572
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,679
this vision of the future. Imagine if we

573
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,240
can have like the same way as we have

574
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,240
today like a smoke detector in every

575
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,640
home. It should be that every home that

576
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,200
has a chronic disease patient. In fact,

577
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,039
every home that has somebody like we

578
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,520
should like take care of the health of

579
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,840
the resident. So imagine a future where

580
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,679
every home at least every home which has

581
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,080
a patient has a an an emerald device

582
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,559
that continuously monitoring the health

583
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,039
of that individual. applying these

584
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:26,240
foundational model and extracting

585
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:28,640
information about diseases and therapies

586
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,799
and be able to inform to talk to the

587
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,880
person because now we can easily have AI

588
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,080
that can talk to people, talk to the

589
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,039
doctor and inform them about how this

590
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,679
person is health is changing and help

591
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,200
personalize health care and improve

592
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,520
outcomes.

593
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,880
I think this is a vision our vision of

594
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:52,000
the future. We hope that you uh help us

595
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,320
and work to with us towards improving

596
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,600
the outcomes, personalizing healthcare

597
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,559
and moving from a like a system that is

598
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,559
reactive. It waits until we have a big

599
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,720
problem, we end up in a hospital to try

600
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,440
to help us to a system that is

601
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,720
proactive. It is looking forward and

602
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,279
being able to predict that we are going

603
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,840
toward an exacerbation and help us

604
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:20,120
before we get to the hospital to avoid

605
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,120
that. Thank you very much.

606
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,720
>> Do we have time for questions?

607
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,760
>> Okay.

608
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:37,039
Any questions?

609
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,120
Oh, how does a device separate data when

610
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,840
there are multiple people in the room

611
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,480
when it's tracking motion sleep? So, I

612
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,720
mean similarly to how like in driver

613
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,039
glass car like you you have this like

614
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,760
rotating laser and it can separate

615
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,679
individual in space. Similarly, wireless

616
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,840
signals has the ability to separate

617
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,080
individual in the space. And then we

618
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,799
have a machine learning model that

619
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,000
focuses on on the patient and ignore

620
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:06,320
signals from like other people or like

621
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,440
also dogs and cats. Many of the homes

622
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,559
have pets including mine.

623
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,480
Uh so how much data is required to

624
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,520
develop such a functional uh

625
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,279
foundational model? Should all HC

626
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:25,039
companies develop their own? How much

627
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:27,360
data? I mean basically this this is very

628
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,360
early question to ask. I mean at this

629
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,000
stage the more the merrier. I mean

630
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:36,640
similarly like we basically we are able

631
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,200
to to be to get with uh hundreds of

632
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,840
millions of tokens some initial results

633
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,080
but of course as that get bigger and

634
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,880
bigger we hope that the performance also

635
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,440
will get better similarly to how we see

636
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,760
that in text and images. what is

637
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:56,640
negative impact of living amongst this

638
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:59,440
high RF and any if any uh so basically

639
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,080
we all are comfortable having Wi-Fi at

640
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,880
home and I think Wi-Fi if you compare it

641
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,039
to any clinical trial I mean they the

642
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,120
Wi-Fi and having Wi-Fi is probably the

643
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:13,520
largest clinical trial on earth and

644
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:17,200
there are no uh basically proven reason

645
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,799
that wifi has any bad effect and if you

646
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,440
are comfortable with Wi-Fi let Let me

647
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:25,919
tell you that this device is 1,000 times

648
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:30,080
lower power than Wi-Fi. So, it is at

649
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:32,640
least as safe as your Wi-Fi at home.

650
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,200
Does the wireless signal uh being used

651
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,440
comply with each country radio wave

652
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,399
related laws and regulations? For

653
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,520
example, is there is there no radio wave

654
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,360
interference? Yeah. So, yes, it does.

655
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,039
This is the the type of technology that

656
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,279
we are using here is called ultra

657
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,000
wideband technology. This is a standard

658
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,919
technology. It is under uh like the FCC

659
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
has standardized it also the European

660
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,399
countries and everywhere. Basically

661
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,240
these are standardized technologies. Uh

662
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:03,279
and they are basically designed ultra

663
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,520
wideband is designed to not interfere

664
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,080
with other technology like Wi-Fi and

665
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,880
cellular and also to be resilient to

666
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,760
interference from other technologies.

667
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,559
to what extent is this kind of health

668
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,640
tech likely to drive pricing models for

669
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:23,200
health insurance and healthcare. So

670
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:25,600
that's very interesting question. I mean

671
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,960
my my problem with the health care

672
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,600
system is that it is all the incentives

673
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,000
are in the wrong place. In fact, and you

674
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,799
there is kind of like the the the cost

675
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,679
is spent in most of the time on like

676
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,520
bureaucracy and documentation that

677
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,080
basically the health insurance want to

678
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,240
like push the cost on the providers and

679
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,799
by adding documentation then the

680
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,520
provider increase the prices because now

681
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,440
they have to like pay put so much time

682
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,799
on like their staff doing the the

683
00:29:53,440 --> 00:30:00,159
documentation. So I think the the main

684
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:03,760
as a researcher my interest is how we

685
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,399
can have health care that is minimize

686
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:10,000
the the the cost to the individual make

687
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,720
it as widely available and better than

688
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,559
existing healthcare and how we can

689
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,720
design the technology. But at the end of

690
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,799
the day there are policies around that

691
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,600
and that also we have to take care of

692
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,000
that so that we ensure that our health

693
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,039
care system does not put policies that

694
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,039
increase the cost on everyone.

695
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,960
Can this device be used to predict the

696
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,720
onset of cardiac events such as

697
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:40,559
eskeemia? uh so we haven't trained this

698
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,480
device on this kind of situation because

699
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,799
basically

700
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,679
in in the current state I'm more

701
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:49,760
interested in chronic diseases on one

702
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,640
hand because chronic diseases are the

703
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,360
bigger problem and also it's much more

704
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,919
natural to monitor them over time and be

705
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:01,279
able to avoid problem if we can detect

706
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,679
things earlier. So basically before

707
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:06,000
something happened like I I'm I'm less

708
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,640
like looking at can we detect someone

709
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,960
who is like when a heart attack occurs

710
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,000
and I'm I'm more interested and can we

711
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,520
detected like when when they are moving

712
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,279
toward like they have a chronic

713
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,919
condition and the chronic disease uh

714
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:23,279
condition is exacerbating also we we

715
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,440
kind of focus so far on more of like uh

716
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,960
neurological diseases, respiratory

717
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,520
diseases and autoimmune diseases because

718
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,919
with uh Fitbit and Apple Watch there is

719
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,480
a lot of work on cardiac things. So I

720
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,279
think there is a gap much bigger on the

721
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,039
neurological and immune uh related

722
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,480
diseases.

723
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:49,320
I see that I run out of time. Thank you

724
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,320
very much. Very nice talking to you.
