1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,520
hello everyone thank you so much for

2
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:09,000
having me today um so profit is has its

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,000
roots in MIT my uh partner and founder

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,759
co-founder Jonathan Burns taught at MIT

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,759
for about 30 years and uh I'm also a

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,279
graduate a lot of businesses right now

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,760
are at an inflection point on AI where

8
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:25,680
the amount of data that they can get out

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,119
of the public domain is pretty much

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,240
reach

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,200
saturation and the real uh Frontier is

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,480
how to use Enterprise data or uh unique

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,200
data to just the Enterprise itself that

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,800
private data uh this is a huge

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,440
opportunity comes up in the Google

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,559
conferences and um this is one of the

17
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,399
things that was written about here in

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:51,640
fortune or Fast Company this is exactly

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,239
where profit is um exists in the use of

20
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,079
uh converting uh proprietary data to a

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,719
usable data set so that corporations can

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,600
use this information and ground

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,560
themselves um in their own

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,720
operations in particular um one of the

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,280
major limitations to AI right now is the

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,799
ability to use the proprietary

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,920
Enterprise data to actually drive AI

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,200
models and also uh data governance trust

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,520
and the ability to validate and not get

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,280
lost in hallucinations on their own data

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,479
so all of these things are challenges

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,479
that uh profiti

33
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,159
addresses so um what's really exciting

34
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,159
is it turns turn out that we do exactly

35
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:37,000
what uh the keynote speaker talked about

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,840
um we are creating synthetic data and

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,960
we're doing it through the lens of the

38
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,439
profit and loss statement that tried and

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,680
true core of any Corporation um we show

40
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,399
up with a corporation that might be

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,479
using three or four profit and loss

42
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:51,719
statements to run their whole business

43
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,159
and uh will create in some instances

44
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,360
over a billion profit and loss

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,079
statements we create a full p&l for

46
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,119
every invoice line of every transaction

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,880
and we use their Enterprise data to do

48
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,759
that and that

49
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,560
transformation is a critical component

50
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:10,160
of how we can actually use large

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,480
language models to generate huge value

52
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,319
for

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,879
corporations and the way we do that is

54
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,720
we can absorb all of the companies data

55
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,319
uh transform it into a value added p&l

56
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,519
for every invoice line and because of

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,599
that the grammar of our data set when

58
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,360
it's output is in the language of the

59
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,879
income statement so it's easily absorbed

60
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,519
as any other language would be in a

61
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,519
large language

62
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:41,000
model what we do is we've identified

63
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:44,040
over the years um 26 distinct data sets

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,720
that are generated by corporations uh we

65
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,560
have a very clear way to absorb those

66
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,159
into the profit and loss statement so

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,760
for example let's say that you're using

68
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,560
GPS data to track your deliveries we'll

69
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,040
take that data and we will then

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,280
calculate the exact cost of every

71
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,400
delivery on Tuesday you got stuck in

72
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,720
traffic on Wednesday it took took you 15

73
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,200
extra minutes to deliver all that is

74
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,159
included in the data sets that we absorb

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,760
and creating that kind of visibility

76
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,440
into what's really happening in the

77
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,920
corporation we do that across all the

78
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,640
line items on a general ledger and we

79
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,400
take all the data that's listed here

80
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,159
which is very

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,920
extensive that First Transformation is

82
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,040
one of the things that creates all these

83
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,360
pnls and this is what you I now will

84
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,200
call uh basically generative data uh or

85
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,040
and the other thing that we do is we

86
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,720
create segmentation data which again

87
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,439
augments the data creates even more

88
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,280
value uh the 8020 rule is Alive and Well

89
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,920
in every corporation that we've worked

90
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,480
with by the way we're approaching $600

91
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,400
billion doll of Revenue through our

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,920
model so it's well vetted across

93
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,920
multiple Industries AC around the

94
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,519
world in one instance we're working with

95
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,439
a 1010 billion retailer uh for them

96
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,079
we've created over a billion pnls we've

97
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,400
taken in 13 data groups across one ERT

98
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,920
system

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,040
and they're using it to monitor their

100
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,720
promotional spending understanding

101
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,840
exactly which customers are profitable

102
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,439
versus not as well as what channels are

103
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,560
profitable versus not um we're using it

104
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,440
to help them with store labor planning

105
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,479
uh with over 2,000 stores uh there are

106
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,799
2,000 people making decisions about one

107
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,639
of the largest expenses in a retailer

108
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,600
and that variability is something that

109
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,800
AI can help with dramatically and

110
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,680
finally uh we help them understand the

111
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,400
profitability of every product every

112
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,600
supplier every plan anagram in every

113
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,120
store so that's an example of where

114
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,280
we're using this transform transform

115
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,960
data um then we also have a global

116
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,720
distributor again uh lots of data groups

117
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,880
three RP systems across multiple

118
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,080
countries here we're helping them see

119
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,880
private label pricing customer contracts

120
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,880
and product mix

121
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,880
optimization and we also work with

122
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,320
global manufacturers here we're looking

123
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,240
at multiple Erp systems across multiple

124
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,320
countries um and we're helping them

125
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,199
understand the actual impact of supply

126
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,720
chain disruptions variability and

127
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,000
inbound uh raw materials as well as

128
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,080
customer negotiations so our ask is that

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,039
uh we'd love to work with some of you uh

130
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,639
in the audience um we work generally

131
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,000
with very large multinational companies

132
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,919
um and overall we uh would love the

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,440
opportunity to work with you if uh you

134
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,440
think this is an opportunity for you

135
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,440
thank you
