1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
Hey, we're provocative. Um, we're

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,160
building an AI data center in

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,960
Somerville. Um, we actually already

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,599
built it. Um, it's over there somewhere

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,320
behind me. Um, our secret sauce is we're

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,400
totally vertically integrated. So, um,

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,480
we build we take over buildings, in this

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,560
case, a big warehouse. We put shipping

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,400
containers inside. We put a lot of GPUs

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,560
in those shipping containers. And then

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,080
the really magic thing is our cooling

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,199
system is actually a carbon capture

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,440
system that we made to suit our business

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,360
model. Um, and so as we run air and hot

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,559
and cold water through our containers,

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,480
GPUs, we actually are bottling up CO2

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,000
and selling it to local breweries and

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,840
bars and restaurants um for make benefit

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,760
earth and cash flow. Um, a lot of MIT

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,480
people on the team. I dropped out. I'm

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,879
sorry. Uh of undergrad, but I came back

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,680
and joined Sloan and the MECI department

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,280
on the faculty. Um I kind of sneaked in.

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,120
Not a real professor. Don't call me a

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,040
professor, but uh I taught classes. Um

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,040
co-founded this with Marty Cper, MIT's

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,640
Makers are helped build the engine. Also

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,560
does a lot of other cool stuff. And then

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,880
my co-founder Rob didn't go to MIT, so

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,360
he's dead to me. Um our first engineer

31
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,840
is Andrew Bulma, who does a had a PhD in

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,560
HVAC and desalination stuff. And so we

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,840
love MIT uh here. Um but we do hire

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,600
other people too, like my co-founder. Um

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,720
the big problem we solve is actually

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,000
AI's uh AI cloud's debt problem. Um if

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,600
you're a data center, you care a lot

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,119
about power and space and bandwidth

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,520
because you buy those things and you

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,360
rent them out on a margin. So power is a

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,680
big part of your cost. If you're a

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,439
cloud, only like two and a half to 5% of

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,360
your cost is actually power. So it

44
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,040
doesn't matter much. What matters is the

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,680
fact that for every dollar you make, you

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,680
spend more than 60%, sometimes more than

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,439
100% of your revenue, servicing your

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,640
debt load. So, that's called a bad

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,240
business. We like good businesses. Um,

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,200
this is a slide that says the same thing

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,399
I just said. Uh, and this also is a

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,560
slide that says what I already just

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,040
said, so I'm going to skip that. Um,

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,119
this is kind of a layout of our system.

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,640
This is an air cooled configuration. So,

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,200
we pull air in, run them through um

57
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,160
modular carbon capture filters we made.

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,120
They're vacuum chambers. Um we use a

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,959
temperature pressure swing process um

60
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,920
where we can actually leverage the heat

61
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,840
coming off the chips for disorption. Um

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,440
which is neat. And then we invented some

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,879
really cool vacuum chambers that are

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,800
extremely lightweight. So, they're

65
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,319
really big, but the shell of them is

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,000
very thin steel instead of really thick

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,440
steel. So individual humans can lift

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,800
them up and you don't die if one falls

69
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,280
on you, which is a really big deal for

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,879
building stuff fast. Um, so the air goes

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,360
through those, goes through the chips,

72
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,680
cools them. It's great. We support air

73
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,160
cooled or liquid cooled versions like

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,760
Sasha said in these extremely dense

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,840
liquid cooled environments where you

76
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,120
have a megawatt per rack. Um, the

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,720
configuration looks a lot like what

78
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,319
Cruso builds these days where you have

79
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,400
like one container surrounded by a bunch

80
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,760
of one container of really hot compute

81
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,159
surrounded by a bunch of containers

82
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,280
evacuating heat to the atmosphere. Um,

83
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,959
so it's really convenient for us. Um,

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,080
lots of financial benefits. We make a

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,879
lot more money. Um, and the main reason

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,879
being that because Coca-Cola and

87
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,480
Annheiser Bush buy our CO2 and they have

88
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,840
incredible credit scores, like better

89
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,319
than the US government, we can borrow

90
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,400
against those contracts, lower our cost

91
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,239
of capital by a massive amount, buy

92
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,800
chips with them, lever that up into tons

93
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,239
of cash flow, and be very profitable.

94
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,080
Um, which is cool. Um, we already have

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,920
tons of customers. We're actually

96
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,319
delivering beverage gate CO2 all over

97
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,040
the Boston area. Um, we're about to take

98
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,319
over the Boston Logan airport contract,

99
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,000
uh, major stadiums around here. Um, no

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,879
one has enough CO2. Supply chain is

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,440
absolutely horrific. Uh, it's so bad.

102
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,159
Um, California alone is under supplied

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,799
by$ 1.5 billion dollars a year worth of

104
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,159
CO2. Um, but it's got to be beverage

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,879
grade and beverage grade is hard to

106
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,480
make. So, we're sold out for forever.

107
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,159
We're doing almost, this is actually

108
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,360
outdated. We're doing almost 1.5 million

109
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,760
in revenue in only 9 months. Um, so

110
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,879
we're growing really fast. Uh, lots of

111
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,799
LOIs, lots of order purchases and stuff.

112
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,720
Um, and but we need to partner all over

113
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,000
the place. You guys are all great. I'd

114
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,840
rather I'm actually putting three

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,720
megawatts in right now. Our our

116
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,320
electrical engineers are here. Uh, I

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,520
have a problem. Um, uh, we use existing

118
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,320
buildings and we got to punch through

119
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,600
walls. So, running one conduit instead

120
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,960
of 16 changes my life. Um, and every

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,440
week that we're not making money, I'm

122
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,199
losing a million dollars. So, um, if you

123
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,720
haven't invested in Ver, you should

124
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,639
invest in them or something like it. And

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,720
I'm I would be a customer. I can't

126
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,000
believe we haven't chatted much. Um, I

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,919
have that problem today. They're here

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,400
right now. Um, but other stuff. We need

129
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,040
transformers, we need GPUs, we need heat

130
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,040
pumps, we need super. Ah, I already put

131
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,800
it on there. CO2 customers, content

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,840
delivery networks, AI companies. If you

133
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,280
need GPUs, um, if you want to give us a

134
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,720
building to build a data center in the

135
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,280
middle of a city, that'd be great. We

136
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,400
focus on um, like in the middle of

137
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,280
cities is where we want to be. That's

138
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,800
where CO2 is. Um, so we can partner with

139
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,960
lots of people and we're excited about

140
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,479
basically everything. Love you. That's

141
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,479
me.

142
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,479
>> Thanks, Nick.

143
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,840
Um, you need a stage. Um, okay. Let me

144
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,680
start with a question and again please

145
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,520
post your questions to the chat or the

146
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,960
Q&A tab. Um tell us a little more about

147
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,639
supporting liquid cooled servers.

148
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,240
>> Yeah. Um well I think uh everyone kind

149
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,120
of sees that liquid cooled's the future

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,199
in the news and that's that's

151
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,600
kind I think true generally especially

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,440
with these rack densities. Um it's a lot

153
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,560
easier for us to harvest the energy from

154
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,639
the chips in a liquid cooled system. Um,

155
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,400
we already for our carbon capture

156
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,199
system, we have to heat up the filters

157
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,560
inside to get the CO2 out of it. And so

158
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,320
we don't have to change much about our

159
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,199
system to kind of integrate into a

160
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,960
cooling loop. Um, and so we kind of run

161
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,440
that loop through the chips, let them

162
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,440
heat it, let it let the water heat up,

163
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,160
um, run that into the carbon capture

164
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,919
filter. Um, and then that helps us

165
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,479
release the CO2. We can harvest a lot of

166
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,160
that about 40% of the kind of energy

167
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,400
lost to heat we can harvest, which is

168
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,639
great. Um, and uh, it's actually we

169
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,800
possible that we can get more dense than

170
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,680
a traditional data center liquid cooled

171
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,360
cooling system because we've got

172
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,960
chemical reactions going on and things

173
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,759
like that. So, it's actually quite

174
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,199
efficient and cheap.

175
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,039
>> Okay. And I was going to ask about the

176
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,600
best spots to build your data centers,

177
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:42,160
but also Jose is asking on that line. Um

178
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,560
spot for the yeah you know for sec uh

179
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,039
compute size of smallmediumsiz data

180
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,120
centers in an urban environment.

181
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,120
>> Yeah. So this is counterintuitive I

182
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
think uh the news again generally the

183
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,120
hyperscalers you know the one to five

184
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,440
gawatt things in the in the middle of

185
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,280
nowhere which are very cool. Um but uh

186
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,599
the backbone of the internet and and the

187
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,120
internet exchanges are all in the top 20

188
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,199
major cities. It's where the all the

189
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,680
undersea cables come in. And there's a

190
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,199
lot of office buildings and factories

191
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,599
that are shut down that have three to

192
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,039
five megawatts. And we can make 200

193
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,360
to$250 million dollars a year out of a 5

194
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,120
megawatt office building. Like that's

195
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,599
why we're here. Um we'll make about a h

196
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,000
100red million a year out of this crappy

197
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,039
factory in Somerville. Um and we're

198
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,880
right on top of a fiber line. So um

199
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,960
where people live is where CO2 is sold

200
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,319
and consumed. So we we need that and and

201
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,400
it's also where it's most in demand and

202
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,680
hardest to get. Um, and it's also where

203
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,919
the internet lives. So that's where we

204
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,240
want to build for now.

205
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,240
>> Got it. Thanks, Nick. Thanks very much.
