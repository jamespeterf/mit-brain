00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:02,776
(regal music)

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,601
(regal music continues)

3
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:15,268
(playful music)

4
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,079
(Professor Wallace laughing)

5
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:25,853
(playful music continues)

6
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:30,912
(wheels squeaking)

7
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:35,426
(playful music continues)

8
00:00:40,326 --> 00:00:42,743
(jazz music)

9
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,670
- Hello, I am David Wallace,

10
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,763
a professor in mechanical
engineering design at MIT.

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,032
Go, go, go, go!

12
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:56,347
(jazz music continues)

13
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,430
Everything is an example.

14
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:07,410
(jazz music continues)

15
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,103
Everything that we do is an
example of what we stand for.

16
00:01:14,856 --> 00:01:17,208
What do we aspire towards?

17
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,650
(jazz music continues)

18
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,110
In the challenge of
working out every detail,

19
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,820
you'll actually find delight.

20
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,653
I do.

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,883
And your work will be
delightful to others.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,097
Delight is in the details.

23
00:01:34,097 --> 00:01:39,097
(jazz music continues)
(students cheering)

24
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:46,469
(calm music)

25
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,940
So everything is an example.

26
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,900
What that means, and
particularly for me as a teacher,

27
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,350
is that everything I do is
sending a message, right?

28
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,590
You're being watched, so
every single thing that I do

29
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,130
is an example saying "This is okay,

30
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,410
you know, this is how we work."

31
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,210
So that's why everything matters.

32
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,280
And where do those messages come from?

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,900
They come from the details, right?

34
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,030
It's all the little details.

35
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,580
Just about, I'm just about to get ready.

36
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,613
Every detail provides an
opportunity for learning.

37
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,080
Teams, may the odds ever be in your favor.

38
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,078
Three, I guess better three two one.

39
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:33,870
They'll do three, two, one.

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,510
Three, two, one, bang.

41
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,850
And the perfect example
of all of those details

42
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,041
coming together, it's the build challenge.

43
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:47,041
(energetic music)
(students cheering)

44
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:51,561
Three, two,

45
00:02:52,427 --> 00:02:54,343
one, go!

46
00:02:54,343 --> 00:02:59,343
(energetic music continues)
(students cheering)

47
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:02,880
The build challenge is our class's

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,640
annual obstacle course competition,

49
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,833
which we have been doing for 15 years.

50
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,360
In a nutshell, students
are grouped into teams

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,130
and tasked with conceptualizing

52
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,080
and building a functional vehicle

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,273
powered only by the
force they exert on it.

54
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,790
Teams then use their
vehicles to traverse a course

55
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,440
and complete a series of challenges

56
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,278
in a themed playful race.

57
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:31,410
(energetic music continues)
(students cheering)

58
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,910
And it's different every
year. It's extreme.

59
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,440
It pushes limits.

60
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,572
It's kind of crazy, and
it's euphoric, it's fun,

61
00:03:41,572 --> 00:03:43,770
(energetic music continues)

62
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,744
and many students come to
MIT, looking forward to it.

63
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:48,577
- Woo!

64
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:50,994
(jazz music)

65
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,300
- There are many reasons
we do the build challenge

66
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,740
every year.

67
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,743
For one, it's a celebration
of teamwork and ingenuity.

68
00:04:00,496 --> 00:04:02,190
(jazz music continues)
(students cheering)

69
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,210
But mainly we do it

70
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:07,170
because it's a practice
example of mechanical design,

71
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,140
problem solving, and engineering.

72
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,670
Our class's mantra

73
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,370
and guiding maxim is
put into practice here.

74
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,710
And remember, what is our cycle of design?

75
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,706
Let's do it all together.

76
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:23,370
- [All] Ideate, model, test!

77
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,010
- It's a sandbox where
students can feel free

78
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:29,490
to generate ideas, build
skills to model those ideas,

79
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,673
and summon the discipline and
courage to test and learn.

80
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,773
We practice so that we can do
it for real in our projects.

81
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,397
It's a message about what
we are here to do, to say,

82
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:46,287
"We hope that you will
approach your work this way."

83
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:51,116
(cheerful music)

84
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:59,646
(cheerful music continues)

85
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:01,860
The build challenge,
when you come down to it,

86
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,900
it's just a single one hour class

87
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,643
in our fourth year design course.

88
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,090
So why do we need a
massive structural tree

89
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:11,550
rigged with pyrotechnics and smoke cannons

90
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,740
towering above our field of play?

91
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,787
- Okay, I think we're all set here.

92
00:05:14,787 --> 00:05:16,533
- Why do something on this scale?

93
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,310
It's not just for fun, right?

94
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,250
It's because every detail is an example,

95
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,895
an opportunity to learn, if you look.

96
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:29,095
- Right. Hey, Jeffrey,
can we test the cryo?

97
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,930
- [Professor] When details
delight, we learn from them,

98
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,880
and get inspired by them.

99
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,230
In short, details are
what make things special.

100
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,140
(cheerful music continues)

101
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,243
The plushies, the pond,

102
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,033
the custom chocolate coins.

103
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:51,810
- That's pretty good!

104
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,510
- The crab, it's just one vehicle

105
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,271
from this past year's challenge.

106
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,620
All of the unseen person
hours, the blood, sweat,

107
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,390
and tears of the dedicated staff

108
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,140
that pull this event off each year.

109
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,330
All of these details all
go into teaching students

110
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,430
that sure you can make any product,

111
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,320
but if you put enough attention to detail

112
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,890
and care into your designs,
you are going to make something

113
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,930
that people can't ignore.

114
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,330
Something truly memorable.

115
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,090
(cheerful music continues)

116
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,240
Treat everything that you do as an example

117
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,160
of what you believe.

118
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,890
Care about the message of your details,

119
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,740
and that's what you'll achieve.

120
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,343
It's time to play seriously.

121
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:42,343
(cheerful music continues)
(students cheering)

122
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:46,050
(students laughing)

123
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,400
Actually feels pretty good.
