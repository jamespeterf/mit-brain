1
00:00:00,839 --> 00:00:07,000
technology uh is closely related to

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:12,400
economics uh decarbonization is really

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,240
we are uh uh considering the externality

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,920
of of of our past the impact of the past

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,039
150 or more years of

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,679
industrialization so I personally I know

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,960
that a lot of the decarbonization

8
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:33,440
Technologies uh are not economically

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,200
viable today without uh orbon price or

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,079
that is the government policy so that's

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,399
why we have our second speaker Dr

12
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,680
Jennifer

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,600
Morris and uh she will talk about this

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,520
important subject uh and Jennifer is is

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:56,879
a principal research scientist at the uh

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:01:01,280
uh mighty MIT uh energy initiatives and

17
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:04,879
the uh joint program on the science of

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,080
global change as well and she's expert

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,000
on energy Transitions and uh econom

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,479
economical development Pathways so is

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,479
that uh Jennifer

22
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,280
please thank you sorry I lost my mute

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,920
button there for a second all right

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,600
thank you so much for the introduction

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,520
um yeah I'm happy to follow up on the

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,520
great talk that Emory gave um and I'm

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,040
going to focus on decarbonization and

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,880
carbon credits and uh I'm going to start

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,200
with a little bit of uh the context

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,439
which I'm sure you're all well aware of

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,399
but just to make sure we're all on the

32
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:52,040
same page um here's a historical view of

33
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:54,040
CO2 emissions by world's region and here

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,240
is the type of decarbonization that

35
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,600
we're talking about um this is an

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,960
example of a global Net Zero by 2050 um

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,560
policy and the dramatic decline in

38
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,039
emissions that it would require and as

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,760
emry showed as well we know that the

40
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,760
bulk of those emissions are coming from

41
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,800
the energy sector and so to achieve

42
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,120
these types of emission targets we need

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,879
a dramatically different Energy System

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,080
and to look at the long-term trend for

45
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:31,120
um Global Energy Mix um here by energy

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:34,400
by type we see that current ly uh fossil

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,560
fuel generation uh natural gas oil coal

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,879
are accounting for about 75% of um

49
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,760
energy and the type of transition we're

50
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,800
talking about again an example Net Zero

51
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,280
Global Net Zero by 2050 policy would

52
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,920
require shrinking those fossil fuels to

53
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,360
only about 25% of the energy mix so a

54
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,959
couple key points about this um is that

55
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,920
this the scale of the energy transition

56
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,400
that we're talking about is dramatic if

57
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,599
we want to meet these long-term climate

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,200
goals and another key point is that this

59
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:13,440
scenario that I'm showing this Net Zero

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,080
by 2050 is just one scenario and there

61
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,560
are countless others and I can't tell

62
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,640
you how many times I interact with

63
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,799
people who see for example the iea the

64
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,319
International Energy agency's Net Zero

65
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,319
scenario and think that is a

66
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:33,080
prescriptive um scenario what we need to

67
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,560
do to achieve the target but it's not

68
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,400
it's one possible Pathway to get there

69
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,280
and there are many different Pathways to

70
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,200
get there and it's really critical that

71
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,159
we explore different Alternatives um

72
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,239
because they have different implications

73
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,959
for things we care about cost land and

74
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:53,000
water infrastructure biodiversity human

75
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,640
well-being and so it's really essential

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,480
to think about alternative scenarios and

77
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,560
Pathways which is one of the things we

78
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,239
um do very well within the MIT energy

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,879
initiative um other key points are that

80
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,000
we can't rely on Technologies alone to

81
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,959
drive the transition we need policies

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,640
and as we just heard from Emory it's

83
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,760
important to keep in mind that energy is

84
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,320
a lot more than just electricity um it's

85
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,000
Transportation fuels it's heat for

86
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,799
industry it's it's a broader concept um

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,079
so we need to go beyond just thinking

88
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,079
about electricity

89
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,520
decarbonization and so to to further

90
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:33,720
this point that there are many Pathways

91
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:37,240
to to achieve Net Zero um we know that

92
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,039
Net Zero means that any released

93
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,120
emissions need to equal any negative

94
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,600
emissions but within that very simple

95
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,680
equation there's still a lot of

96
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,680
questions that arise um first of all

97
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,039
what are we talking about Net Zero what

98
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,680
um often times targets that are declared

99
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,280
aren't even clear if they're talking

100
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,280
about just CO2 or fossil energy CO2 or

101
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,520
industrial CO2 what about land use

102
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,000
change CO2 um or are we talking about

103
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,840
all greenhouse

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,800
gases another question is the timing of

105
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,240
Net Zero um

106
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,280
often we hear about Net Zero by 2050 but

107
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,400
I think it's very important to note that

108
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,880
that's not actually a requirement for

109
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,319
achieving a

110
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,919
1.5c um temperature

111
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:29,919
stabilization um that stabilization will

112
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,440
require total greenhouse gas gas

113
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:36,160
emissions to eventually decline to Net

114
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,840
Zero but the the choice of 2050

115
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,000
specifically is really a political

116
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,759
Choice um and the science um has shown

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,120
if we look at for example the IPC

118
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,759
Special Report on 1.5 um there's 90

119
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,919
scenarios that achieve 1.5c and only 18

120
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:56,280
of those have net zero emissions um and

121
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,199
only CO2 and Industrial emissions in

122
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:03,680
2050 and if we look at the mo the latest

123
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:07,160
um uh ipcc assessment report we see that

124
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,240
while all of the 1.5c scenarios that

125
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,960
achieve that Target with a 50% chance

126
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,240
achieve Net Zero CO2 emissions the

127
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:20,039
timing varies um from 2035 to 2070

128
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,599
there's nothing magical about 2050 and

129
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:25,400
only half of those Pathways in the

130
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:28,240
report achieve Net Zero greenhouse gas

131
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,880
emissions at any point during the 21st

132
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,960
century and so so really the the the

133
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,080
commitment to the 2050 Target is more of

134
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,039
a a a political choice and maybe a

135
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,000
recognition of the need for climate

136
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:45,560
leadership and I wanted to highlight um

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,520
a paper that we worked on that compared

138
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,680
a global net zero Pathway to an

139
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:54,960
alternative pathway that achieves 1.5c

140
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,479
temperature stabilization with a 50%

141
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,319
probability that's the difference

142
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,319
between the orange line and the blue

143
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,440
line here and so while the the orange

144
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,280
line is specifically designed to achieve

145
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,240
that 1.5c Target at the end of the

146
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,319
century with a 50% chance um the Blue

147
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,639
Line based on our climate model

148
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:16,879
simulations is expected to achieve about

149
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,599
1.2 degrees by the end of the century

150
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:23,039
virtually guaranteeing the achievement

151
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,280
of the 1.5c target however that comes at

152
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,120
a substantial cost and so if you look at

153
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,879
the lower left here um you can see a

154
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,440
dramatic increase in the the global um

155
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:37,960
change in consumption or change in

156
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,479
GDP between these two emission Pathways

157
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,919
with the global net zero Target costing

158
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,960
significantly more especially around

159
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,800
mid-century where it's extremely

160
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,840
difficult to achieve that net zero

161
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
emissions um so these are this is a

162
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,840
trade-off right are we willing to pay

163
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,159
more to guarantee achievement of the

164
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,840
1.5c Target or

165
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:03,840
not um other questions relate to the

166
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,759
pathway to Net Zero um even if we have a

167
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,039
Target we say 2050 often it's not um

168
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,720
thought through exactly how to get there

169
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:15,639
maybe a straight line is drawn from

170
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,680
present to 2050 um but there's obviously

171
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,319
different ways you can get to the end

172
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,720
point and they will have different

173
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,639
implications for things like the

174
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,080
Technologies involved the cost of

175
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,680
meeting the Target and even the climate

176
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,560
um because it will involve different

177
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,280
amounts of cumulative emissions along

178
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,640
the way

179
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:36,120
and then an important question is really

180
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,080
about the amount of released emissions

181
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,800
versus the amount of negative emissions

182
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,519
that are involved in the net zero and

183
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,560
this question is important not only for

184
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:48,040
Net Zero but also for stringent targets

185
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,160
like a a 2C or 1.5c

186
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,440
pathway and as we we heard from

187
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,360
Emery the whole there are difficult to

188
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,519
eliminate emissions in the economy and

189
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,000
that's the whole reason we're even

190
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,279
talking about Net Zero um there are some

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,800
activities for which there are currently

192
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,480
no good Alternatives or very very

193
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,800
expensive Alternatives um and that means

194
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,680
that some emissions are likely to

195
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:18,240
persist in the economy and we're going

196
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,240
to need negative emissions to offset

197
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,000
them and so this question of of how to

198
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,040
balance the negative emissions and the

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,519
released emissions is an important one

200
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,519
and one strategy is to reduce emissions

201
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,600
as much as possible and offset the

202
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,120
remaining difficults to eliminate

203
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,160
emissions with negative emissions and

204
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,240
this is commonly what is assumed will

205
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,920
happen however there is an alternative

206
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,480
strategy in which we continue to release

207
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,399
and then offset any emissions with a

208
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,640
marginal abatement cost that is greater

209
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,240
than the cost per ton of negative

210
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,279
emissions

211
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,320
this means if you can buy offsets for a

212
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,800
lower cost than it would cost you to

213
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,240
Abate your emissions you'll do that and

214
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,000
so this is a very different picture and

215
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,640
both of these strategies and ones in

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,320
between can achieve the exact same net

217
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,079
emissions pathway but they will have

218
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,519
extremely different implications for the

219
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:25,279
Technologies involved the cost of

220
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,800
meeting the Target and other things we

221
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:31,079
care about such as land use Health

222
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:35,040
biodiversity Etc

223
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:36,880
so um what would drive us to one

224
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,880
strategy or another um there could be

225
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,519
specific policy uh around the amount of

226
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,440
negative emissions that might be used or

227
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,200
um if there's not in in the absence of

228
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,720
that there an important driver will be

229
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,000
the cost of

230
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,440
Technologies and so we know that there's

231
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
generally two categories of of

232
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,519
Technologies there's low carbon

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,040
Technologies where the goal is to lower

234
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,160
released emiss

235
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,160
um some of the key ones are shown here

236
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,200
and then there's a category of negative

237
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,000
emission Technologies where the goal is

238
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,399
to offset released emissions um some of

239
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,079
the big players in that category are

240
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,079
bioenergy with carbon capture and

241
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:17,480
storage direct air capture and

242
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:20,880
nature-based solutions such as

243
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,519
aforestation and while there are many

244
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,040
options with within each of these

245
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,959
categories they have different costs

246
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,760
they have different technology Readiness

247
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,320
levels they have different emissions

248
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,040
implication and public perceptions so

249
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,839
there's pros and cons to each which

250
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,800
suggests as emry said there's it's very

251
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,760
unlikely for there to be any Silver

252
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,160
Bullet that going to solve this problem

253
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,440
um but at a very basic level there's a

254
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,880
there's a trade-off between these two G

255
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,200
categories in which the more low carbon

256
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,120
Technologies we employ the fewer

257
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,959
negative emission Technologies we need

258
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,800
and vice

259
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:59,279
versa and research that we've conducted

260
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,399
here at MIT has suggested that there's a

261
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,560
a significant potential role for

262
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:08,360
negative emissions in that global net

263
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,560
zero greenhouse gas by 2050 scenario

264
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:14,720
that we've run for example um our

265
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:17,079
modeling optimizes meeting that Target

266
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,760
by deploying a significant amount of

267
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:22,279
negative emissions you can see on the

268
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,399
far left there's a lot of Becks in

269
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:28,600
particular bio energy with

270
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,680
ccs and that deployment en enables the

271
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,160
continued

272
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,360
emissions from fossil energy and non-co2

273
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,760
greenhouse gases um and you can see in

274
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,839
the energy mix in the middle a a

275
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,279
significant deployment of

276
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,279
bioenergy and a continuation of fossil

277
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,800
energy now if you look all the way to

278
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:54,199
the right um the blue and the gray

279
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,880
hashed marks are colon gas with ccs so a

280
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:58,519
lot of the coal and gas that continue in

281
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,360
that scenario are accompanied by CCS

282
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:04,199
however the orange in the middle plot is

283
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,839
oil and so the negative emissions from

284
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:10,160
the beex um deployment is really being

285
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,920
used to offset the continued use of

286
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,320
oil now if we did have more cost

287
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,040
competitive technology options for ating

288
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,240
emissions for example in energy

289
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,720
intensive Industries or commercial

290
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,600
transportation that could Rel reduce the

291
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:28,160
Reliance on negative emissions

292
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:31,160
um let's see research has also suggested

293
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,839
better economic outcomes with the more

294
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,519
deployment of negative emissions in this

295
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,240
study that we conducted we looked at 2C

296
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,800
and

297
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:44,120
1.5c um temperature stabilization

298
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:47,160
scenarios without bio energy with ccs

299
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,320
those are in purple versus with bio

300
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,440
energy with ccs those are in in green

301
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,279
and what we found is that the

302
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,720
availability of the beex essentially

303
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,880
caps the carbon

304
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,279
price while significantly reducing the

305
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,880
policy cost um resulting in policy costs

306
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:10,320
more like four to 5% of global um

307
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,120
consumption compared to 13 to 19% while

308
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,360
having a limited impact on food prices

309
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,160
so this is a this is a very appealing

310
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,839
economic

311
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,399
outcome now

312
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,079
importantly we need to think about what

313
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,320
is a realistic scale of carbon dioxide

314
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,720
removal

315
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,720
deployment and this is really going to

316
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,440
depend on the assumed climate policy

317
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,759
regime and this is because the most

318
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:40,639
coste effective CDR options are

319
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:43,639
geographically concentrated and would be

320
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,519
inaccessible to Global markets without

321
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:49,360
trade and in turn the level of

322
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:52,000
trading um is likely to depend on how

323
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,600
article six of the Paris agreement is

324
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,440
implemented article six is the article

325
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,519
that

326
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,959
allows different nations to cooperate in

327
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,000
their achiev M of their emission targets

328
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,240
and trade

329
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,120
emissions and another important point is

330
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:12,519
trading across Regional Net Zero or near

331
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,240
zero targets is is predicated on the

332
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,560
availability of negative emissions in

333
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,920
some regions in order to offset the

334
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,560
remaining positive emissions and others

335
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,480
or else there is nothing to

336
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,240
trade um so we wanted to dig into this

337
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,240
question and we have a recent paper that

338
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,440
just came out that focuses on this

339
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,279
interplay between land intensive carbon

340
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,440
dioxide removal options and

341
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,399
international trade in greenhouse gas

342
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,920
emissions permits in order to assess the

343
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,959
the deployment of these

344
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,720
Technologies so to do that we use a a

345
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:47,560
different tool than the tool emry was

346
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,079
talking about it's called the MIT

347
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:54,720
economic projection and policy analysis

348
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:57,600
or EPA model and this is a multi sector

349
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,880
multi-region model of the world economy

350
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,880
that we use for energy economic and

351
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,959
emission

352
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,319
projections and it tries to make use of

353
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,560
the highly detailed and Tech

354
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:13,240
technological detail of work such as em

355
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,560
is doing um but putting it into a

356
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,839
context that is covering um all sectors

357
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,399
of the economy and all regions of the

358
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,920
world and interactions across those

359
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:27,759
markets so um capturing feedbacks across

360
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:31,680
regions and sectors um interindustry

361
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:35,399
linkages um um ex uh endogenous price

362
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,920
effects and GDP effects um so um there's

363
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,360
a lot going on in this model I won't

364
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,199
spend too much time talking about it um

365
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,759
but it's it's well recognized and

366
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:47,800
commonly used for this type of um

367
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,079
analysis however for the work that we

368
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,199
wanted to focus on that involved this

369
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,040
landbased carbon dioxide removal

370
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:56,519
Technologies we needed to make sure we

371
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,959
had were well representing some key

372
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:03,120
features related to land um such as its

373
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:05,319
availability and competition um the

374
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,120
representation of different dedicated

375
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,079
biomass crops the cost of these

376
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,240
Technologies um representation of

377
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:16,199
aforestation and reforestation land

378
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,919
conversion cost um direct and indirect

379
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:21,079
land use change emissions International

380
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,559
Trade of Agriculture and food

381
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,400
commodities and different

382
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,839
decarbonization policies and their their

383
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,640
impacts so all of those features are

384
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,200
included in this model model um which we

385
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,720
then use to run a set of

386
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,720
scenarios and so the scenarios that we

387
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,000
are looking at are all 2 Dee temperature

388
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,840
stabilization scenarios with a 66%

389
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,160
probability I should mention that our

390
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,200
economic model the EPA model that I just

391
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,240
mentioned is linked to the MIT Earth

392
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,840
system um model and so we can pass it

393
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,880
our resulting emissions and run the

394
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:02,320
Earth System model to project future

395
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,320
climate change um so we've done that

396
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,080
here and we're running scenarios

397
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,760
consistent with a 2C um temperature

398
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:13,520
Target um importantly the we have

399
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,760
regionally differentiated emissions

400
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,679
limits um and those are based on

401
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,559
existing commitments as well as

402
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,400
proportional historical contributions to

403
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,600
greenhouse gas

404
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,760
concentrations and then we're looking at

405
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,880
this set of scenarios that are exploring

406
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,400
different combinations of the availab

407
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,400
ility of international emissions trading

408
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,880
and carbon dioxide removal specifically

409
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,640
aforestation reforestation and be so you

410
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,120
can see the four um scenarios here in

411
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,000
this grid um going from neither trading

412
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,360
or CDR to be being available or both

413
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,360
being

414
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,760
available and so what we find first

415
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,960
looking at the results for the

416
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:02,280
deployment of CDR um is that first A4

417
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:06,039
station is pursued it's the lowest cost

418
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,400
negative emission option um we find um

419
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:12,320
but then it's followed by the a

420
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:16,320
significant deployment of Becks and look

421
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:19,640
focusing on the left side when trading

422
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,880
of emissions is allowed it opens up more

423
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,840
opportunities for CDR in countries that

424
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,919
have competitive advantages for those

425
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,880
Technologies and on the right without

426
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,960
International emissions trading we find

427
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:38,200
significantly less CDR is deployed about

428
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,480
60% less and this suggests that in the

429
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,799
world on the left there's a significant

430
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,360
amount of the CDR that's being produced

431
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:50,640
for sale

432
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:53,480
abroad and in that case we can see the

433
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:57,400
majority of this CDR is coming from a

434
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,720
few regions those that have comp um

435
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,360
comparative advantage for those

436
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,640
Technologies especially land

437
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,400
availability or high crop yields um or

438
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,559
other factors that would would make

439
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,960
those Technologies competitive and the

440
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:15,720
regions that that they're deploying are

441
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:19,320
not surprising um Latin America Africa

442
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,960
Brazil Russia are some of the key

443
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,799
players and importantly not all of these

444
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,480
negative emissions are being sold as

445
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,400
offsets to other countries some are

446
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,520
being used to meet internal um emission

447
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,880
targets but the majority about 2/3 by

448
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,440
the end of the century are

449
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,440
being produced to be sold

450
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:50,240
abroad and we see um that when we can

451
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:52,880
trade um when we're looking at the the

452
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,159
emission the scale of emissions

453
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,120
trading when we have CDR available it

454
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,799
significantly increases the the scale of

455
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:05,559
global emissions trading in the long run

456
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:07,520
um without those CDR options there's

457
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:09,720
very little wiggle room for

458
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,880
international emissions trading when

459
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:16,039
most countries in the world are nearing

460
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,120
near zero emission

461
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:21,159
targets and

462
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,440
so thinking about who is buying the

463
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:26,159
offsets um we can see that here and

464
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,600
there are many regions but the biggest

465
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,640
players in terms of being the buyers are

466
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:37,200
China India us and Europe and again we

467
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:40,120
saw who the producers were um but there

468
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,960
are if you focus on the gray bar at the

469
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:46,240
top there are uh a number of emerging

470
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,080
economies that are also becoming buyers

471
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,480
of offsets in in this

472
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:55,000
case um next looking at the carbon price

473
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,080
um carbon prices depend on the

474
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,120
availability of CDR and international

475
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,400
emissions trading and here I'm showing

476
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,080
um carbon prices indexed or or

477
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,720
normalized to the the best case or the

478
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,720
lowest carbon prices which include both

479
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:16,400
CDR and

480
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:19,039
trading and we find that when you don't

481
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,440
have CDR or trading we have

482
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,440
significantly higher carbon prices and

483
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,080
that's the gray dash line and that's

484
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,480
because in that scenario each region is

485
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,600
forced to to meet its cap domestically

486
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,000
without the use of negative emissions

487
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,320
and that can be extremely expensive for

488
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,360
some regions and so with global trading

489
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,960
and CDR the optimal strategy for many

490
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,520
regions is to emit above their cap and

491
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,200
to purchase offsets from the

492
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,640
international

493
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,159
market and that

494
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,799
strategy results in the highest GDP

495
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,640
growth for all regions of the world um

496
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:04,120
all of the count do best in terms of

497
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,320
their economic outcomes when both um CDR

498
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:08,880
and international emissions trading are

499
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,360
available um but an important finding of

500
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:16,919
this work um is that the availability of

501
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,600
CDR without trading actually results in

502
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,840
higher GDP growth than the availability

503
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,679
of trading without

504
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,480
CDR and it's long been known in economic

505
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:30,799
literature that emissions trading um

506
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,720
lowers the cost of achieving a policy so

507
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:37,039
we expect for emissions trading to lower

508
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,400
cost but it was a a new finding that c

509
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:43,000
the availability of CDR can lower cost

510
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,039
even more than emissions trading and in

511
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,960
all of the regions the worst economic

512
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:51,240
outcomes are when neither CDR or trading

513
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,240
are

514
00:23:52,360 --> 00:24:01,320
available and we also took a look at the

515
00:23:56,039 --> 00:24:04,120
scale of transfers in involved in in

516
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:07,320
these scenarios and under the different

517
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:10,840
settings the scale of emissions traded

518
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:14,400
and the scale of CDR both move in

519
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:17,520
opposite directions of carbon prices so

520
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,279
when you have more trading or more CDR

521
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:24,080
you have lower prices and vice versa and

522
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:27,720
so as a result the total amount of

523
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:31,840
resources spent on International offsets

524
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:35,000
is similar both with and without CDR

525
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,559
that's what I'm showing on the left and

526
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,399
that total amount spent reaches over $7

527
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:42,360
trillion in

528
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:44,840
2100 and a growing portion of that

529
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,840
spending is coming from emerging

530
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,600
economies um which is an important um

531
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,120
result as well and then if you look on

532
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,799
the right we similarly find that the

533
00:24:53,120 --> 00:25:00,440
total revenue received by producers of

534
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:02,919
these offsets is similar both with and

535
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,880
without emissions trading and it reaches

536
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:09,679
over 9 trillion by

537
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:12,760
2100 um and with trading the vast

538
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,640
majority of the CDR revenue is acre in

539
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:18,200
emerging economies so emerging economies

540
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,360
there's a subset that are receiving

541
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,399
massive amounts of transfers through the

542
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,720
sale of offsets but there's also a set

543
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:29,279
of emerging economies who

544
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:33,240
are paying an increasing amount for

545
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:37,320
offsets um so this is important

546
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:40,360
political economy dynamics of cost and

547
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:45,360
benefits to different groups of emerging

548
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,200
economies um importantly while the scale

549
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,320
of

550
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,480
the um resource transfers involved are

551
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,039
similar regardless of the scenario the

552
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,799
efficiency of that implied spending

553
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,240
differs significantly

554
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,679
and that's what we saw in the GDP

555
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:08,679
results um spending is most efficient

556
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:12,279
when both CDR and Emissions trading are

557
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:14,320
unconstrained um so you can get a lot

558
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,120
more bang for your spending if you can

559
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,399
trade and have

560
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:22,320
CDR um so to to provide a a summary of

561
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:24,880
these findings

562
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,440
um we we are finding that emissions

563
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,720
trading and CDR are mutually reinforcing

564
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,159
in deep decarbonization scenarios um

565
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:37,559
that International emissions trading

566
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:40,880
unlocks geographically distributed CDR

567
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:44,159
potential and that trading in a net zero

568
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,840
world really requires negative emissions

569
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,720
um without them there would be nothing

570
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,120
to

571
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,240
trade um however most of the

572
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:56,720
literature um ignores this relationship

573
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,720
because scenarios are commonly assumed

574
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,960
to have the most optim optimistic

575
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,000
settings um if you look at um long-term

576
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,799
2C or 1.5c scenarios in the literature

577
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,120
they overwhelmingly assume both um

578
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:14,399
International emissions trading and um

579
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,080
carbon dioxide removal availability

580
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:18,640
which may not be the case and so we need

581
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,600
to be thinking about these alternative

582
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:26,799
scenarios that may not have those um

583
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,399
available um this work also um speaks to

584
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:32,840
the importance of Po design as it

585
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:36,799
relates to trading as it relates to CDR

586
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:40,840
Technologies and offset markets offset

587
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:43,720
markets are currently um extremely

588
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,880
immature they're basically voluntary

589
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:50,200
offset markets or what it currently

590
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:53,120
exist um and there are a lot of things

591
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:57,000
that would need to be flushed out for um

592
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,320
the type of CDR and offset um trading

593
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,440
that I showed in these scenario arios um

594
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,080
thinking about things about the

595
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:08,399
longevity of the negative emissions are

596
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,240
there differences in um the permanence

597
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,720
of the negative emissions that come from

598
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,080
aforestation reforestation compared to

599
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,519
beex compared to direct air capture um

600
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:22,600
if there are differences um do we value

601
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:26,519
the offsets differently and how so how

602
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,720
to how do we speak to um small

603
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,799
individual landh holders versus versus

604
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,519
large landholders in terms of things

605
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:37,000
like aforestation and

606
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:40,279
reforestation and what about things like

607
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,919
wildfires um forest fires that

608
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:46,440
potentially um wipe out your aforest

609
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,120
station emission syns um what happens

610
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,559
then so there's a lot of things that

611
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,399
would need to be flushed out in terms of

612
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:58,799
offset markets to make these types of um

613
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:01,840
uh offset trading a reality

614
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,640
um we also as I mentioned find that CDR

615
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,640
matters more for um GDP than

616
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,279
International emissions

617
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,120
trading we find rules for both beex and

618
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:15,679
aforestation

619
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,799
reforestation um in this work we did not

620
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,360
include um direct air capture as an

621
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:24,000
option however we have previous work

622
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,200
that has um included direct air capture

623
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,840
and we also have um uh my colleagues and

624
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,880
I have recently

625
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:35,760
um published a commentary on the topic

626
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,799
and our consensus is that direct air

627
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,640
capture is just too expensive um it's a

628
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,760
lot more expensive than um most studies

629
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,840
in the literature that are site numbers

630
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,200
of100 to $200 per ton of CO2 removed uh

631
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,039
we believe it's more like in the range

632
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,840
of $600 to $1,000 per ton of CO2 removal

633
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,760
um and therefore not economically

634
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,080
competitive with beex or aforestation

635
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:02,159
reforestation at least least not um

636
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,960
under current projected costs that we

637
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,600
find um importantly the buyers and

638
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:12,080
sellers of permits are going to depend

639
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:14,960
on comparative advantages in um CDR

640
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,360
Technologies as well as in the assumed

641
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,840
decarbonization trajectories for each

642
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,120
region um depending on how different

643
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,559
countries

644
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:29,159
um set their emission targets that will

645
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:31,279
change

646
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:34,519
um

647
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:37,200
their willingness or ability to trade

648
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:40,399
participate in emissions

649
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,960
trading um finally well the scale of

650
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,720
resources is not strongly does not VAR

651
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,600
strongly depending on the scenario but

652
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,760
it's more efficient when we have both

653
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,320
trading and

654
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,240
cddr um and the final important point

655
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,639
about the resource transfers these are

656
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,679
potentially extremely large transfers of

657
00:30:56,639 --> 00:31:02,080
resources if we're talking about

658
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:05,240
emissions trading um and using CDR

659
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,679
offsets and most of it ends up in a very

660
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,240
limited set of regions and we find

661
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,120
emerging economies spending an

662
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:17,399
increasing amount on offsets over time

663
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,200
um and this is probably a different um

664
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:22,159
distributional outcome in terms of

665
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,639
resource transfers um than is being

666
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,720
advocated on the international scene in

667
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:30,159
terms of um the conference of the

668
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,880
parties the cop um under the UN um and

669
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,480
the Paris agreement process there's long

670
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,039
been discussions about um resource

671
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,159
transfers to developing and emerging

672
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:45,519
economies to help meet decarbonization

673
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:49,440
targets um and if you want to have

674
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,360
specific um distributional outcomes um

675
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,840
you can achieve them but you would need

676
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,039
to have more purposeful design of

677
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,440
emissions Caps or transfer mechanisms if

678
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,880
you just rely on the sale of carbon

679
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:06,200
offsets and and emission permit credits

680
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,039
um you would likely not see the

681
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,080
distributional outcome in terms of

682
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:12,880
resource transfers that um is being

683
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:17,480
demanded on the international stage um

684
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:20,279
so with that I am happy to um end and

685
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:23,919
look forward to some discussion and

686
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:27,559
questions thank you hey thanks thanks

687
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:31,080
Jennifer uh it's great great analysis uh

688
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:32,480
uh big picture uh issues we all need to

689
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:37,399
understand between

690
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:40,559
countries uh uh a few questions uh uh Al

691
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:43,720
studies that um go beyond the energy

692
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,039
sector but also including the U uh

693
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,880
Agriculture and the farm

694
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:52,120
industry uh yes and um apologies for not

695
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,720
making it clear but the the study I just

696
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,360
talked about covers all sectors of the

697
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,320
economy including Agriculture and

698
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,639
farming and so we are capturing not only

699
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,519
the emissions of the Agricultural

700
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:10,360
activities themselves but also emissions

701
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:13,159
related to changes in how we use land um

702
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:17,480
so those are in there as well as

703
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:22,120
um energy emissions from um the service

704
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:23,880
sector from um Aviation and shipping um

705
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,639
any all of the emissions in the economy

706
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,799
are covered under our um the study I was

707
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:32,480
just describing which is imposing an

708
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:35,559
economy-wide limit on greenhouse gas

709
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,840
emissions okay thank you uh next

710
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:41,840
question uh do you see the CDR emissions

711
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,679
trading occurring through the uh

712
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,639
International emissions trading

713
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:51,919
Association or or have you look into the

714
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:56,120
the mature maturity of compliance and

715
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:59,760
the verification services to validate

716
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:02,440
the CDR claims a long question but sure

717
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,080
yeah um yeah no it's a great question I

718
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:08,839
think this is one of the big question

719
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,119
marks um potentially through the

720
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:13,760
international missions trading

721
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:16,200
Association potentially through um

722
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:20,839
bilateral or multilateral agreements

723
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:24,639
across Nations um potentially a broader

724
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:27,800
um Global mechanism like set up through

725
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,639
article six of the Paris agreement um

726
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,800
there's a lot of questions and a lot of

727
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:36,839
possibilities about how this could um

728
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:40,119
play out and the compliance and

729
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:42,280
verification is an extremely important

730
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:45,839
question mark in when it comes to

731
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:48,960
offsets overall um as I mentioned offset

732
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:53,040
markets so far are are voluntary and

733
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:56,480
there are services that try to um

734
00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:01,880
validate or credit them but there's not

735
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:04,960
an a L accepted or agreed upon um system

736
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:08,040
for doing that there are different ways

737
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,720
to think about offsets especially as

738
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,599
they relate to land and it really

739
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,280
matters what you are assuming is your

740
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:21,280
your Baseline and on the international

741
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:26,280
um policy scene you will see differences

742
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:28,640
for example um Brazil has a lot of

743
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:32,920
forest and

744
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:35,680
they would argue that they should

745
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:39,680
receive credits for not further

746
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,119
deforesting the Amazon if if other parts

747
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,800
of the world want Brazil to protect the

748
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:46,960
Amazon instead of cutting it down to

749
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,400
further their Economic Development they

750
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,720
should receive credits for

751
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,920
that other people would argue that you

752
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,800
should only receive credits for

753
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,760
additions that you're making to the

754
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,960
current state

755
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,400
and so there's different accounting

756
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:08,160
systems and schemes that

757
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,359
can uh get at very different results of

758
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:14,040
what counts as an offset or not and so

759
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,400
that's an area of international debate

760
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,680
um and that's an area that adds

761
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,800
complexity to the question of of what

762
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,040
counts as a credit um and then the

763
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,800
verification and monitoring is extremely

764
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,079
important and something that also needs

765
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,000
um further attention and exactly how to

766
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,319
make it

767
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:40,680
work okay thanks uh uh what are some of

768
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:44,480
the proposed methods for determine what

769
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,680
the carbon caps should

770
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,520
be um

771
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:53,200
so

772
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:55,920
there are the carbon caps

773
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,040
for are going to vary depending on the

774
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,720
scale of which you're talking

775
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,359
um so in terms of global greenhouse gas

776
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:07,119
emissions

777
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:11,319
um we can give you as scientist a range

778
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,680
of global emissions that we are are

779
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:16,440
confident could

780
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,359
achieve a given temperature Target um

781
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,800
for example the pathway I showed that

782
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:24,480
could achieve a 1.5 emissions Target

783
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,960
with a a 50% probability we can

784
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,520
calculate the those types of global

785
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,599
emissions that are more or less

786
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,280
consistent with a a temperature Target

787
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,240
with some some probability because

788
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,319
there's always uncertainty in how

789
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,119
emissions get translated into

790
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:42,880
temperature change in the earth system

791
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,880
um how then those global emissions get

792
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,720
distributed across nations of the world

793
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,680
is an important question um so far we've

794
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:55,800
left the process in the Paris agreement

795
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:58,599
for countries to um put forth their own

796
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,720
targets um and we have seen

797
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:05,880
growing pressure to increasingly move

798
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,800
towards Net Zero by midcentury more or

799
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,359
less um I I showed the figure there of

800
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:16,400
if if everybody actually did Net Zero by

801
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:19,119
2050 would overachieve a 1.5c Target um

802
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,920
but we can do different things as

803
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,800
economists one of the things we do is we

804
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:28,640
set we can set a use our modeling tools

805
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:31,640
and set a global a emissions um app and

806
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,760
then let everybody trade in our model

807
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:38,560
and find the cost optimal allocation of

808
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,880
emission reductions by region um whether

809
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,319
or not countries will listen to that

810
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,079
type of um analysis is a different

811
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:50,839
question and may not align with the

812
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:54,160
political uh economy scene um so some

813
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:57,240
thoughts there yeah sure more questions

814
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:01,599
uh do you think trading of offsets will

815
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:06,280
take take hold uh what major efforts are

816
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:08,359
being taken for advocating for offsets

817
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:13,040
and the

818
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:13,040
tradings um so

819
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,640
there the the role of carbon dioxide

820
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,880
removal Technologies in these deep

821
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:27,560
decarbonization scenarios um has proven

822
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,520
to be increasingly important in the

823
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:34,960
literature we we are consistently

824
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:38,920
finding um a a strong potential role for

825
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:43,839
CDR um if we're going to be using

826
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,680
CDR um the value of that right is we

827
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,720
could

828
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:50,560
potentially um produce negative

829
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:52,599
emissions in a way that's cheaper than

830
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,960
some of our abatement options and these

831
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:57,839
really hard to Abate sectors so that's

832
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:01,960
going to let us achieve targets in a

833
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:05,040
more cost-effective way um whether or

834
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,560
not we're going to allow trading across

835
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,359
regions of these Miss negative emission

836
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:14,079
offsets it is a question and I think a

837
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,640
lot of attention is currently being

838
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,760
given to that question of how could we

839
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,720
realistically make that work and there's

840
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,480
a lot of attention to that question

841
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,839
because it has such a large potential to

842
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:31,400
lower the cost of Glo of meeting

843
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:33,960
policies across the globe so there's um

844
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,880
desire to make it work and I think

845
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,839
attention to how re how we could

846
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,280
realistically do that is growing um I

847
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:46,800
think a key example or a key push for

848
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,280
that reality is coming from the aviation

849
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,359
industry um which currently is the

850
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,240
largest purchaser of voluntary offsets

851
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,440
um because Aviation is so hard and

852
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:03,119
expensive to decarbonize and so um

853
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:04,960
there's a a a real interest in that

854
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,920
industry to make these offset markets

855
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,960
work and I think kind of having a

856
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,280
industry leader pushing this helps um in

857
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,880
the real world to try to get these

858
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,880
markets up and

859
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:19,000
running okay Jen one more question uh

860
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,160
when you have those tradings among

861
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:28,640
different countries uh uh how are the

862
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:32,079
carbon price uh set is that based on the

863
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:36,839
cost of Technology of uh uh abating the

864
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:40,319
CO2 emission in the buying side and the

865
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:43,440
cost of avoid emission in the producing

866
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:46,720
side yeah it's and it's a good question

867
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,640
and um it will depend on the design of

868
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:52,160
the policy the specifics in the in the

869
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,359
scenarios that I showed we put them all

870
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:59,960
under the same

871
00:41:54,359 --> 00:42:02,400
policy so in a a permit from a baiting

872
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,680
was equal to a permit from a negative

873
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,480
emission and so there's just one carbon

874
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,240
price um and as long as there's trading

875
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,040
that carbon price would be the same with

876
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:16,599
any um trading

877
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,960
partners um however there are other

878
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:22,040
strategies out there um and I think

879
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,599
maybe the UK is an example or in the EU

880
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:27,240
they're thinking about having um

881
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:29,800
distinct targets for abatement and

882
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,400
carbon dioxide removal and therefore

883
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,800
they would not be within the same market

884
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,720
and you might be talking about then

885
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:40,240
having um one price for your abatement

886
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:43,520
in your cap and trade system and a

887
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,200
different price for offsets um but you

888
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:50,160
could bring those offsets into your cap

889
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:53,640
to cover your achievement of your your

890
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,359
target um so it really would depend on

891
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:00,480
how the policy is set up there's

892
00:42:56,359 --> 00:43:00,480
examples in avenues for both

893
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:09,839
ways okay uh now how do you inovation

894
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:15,839
the the um credit producing countries or

895
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:19,640
regions uh obtain those um reductions

896
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:21,160
by uh carbon negative emissions or by

897
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,920
not

898
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,200
DeForest te like as you mentioned in

899
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,079
Brazil

900
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:33,319
case how does it generate those credit

901
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:36,920
so that the the the price is low enough

902
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:40,480
that the other side of will buy

903
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,319
it yeah and so a lot of the the regions

904
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,000
that we see with the the biggest

905
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:48,839
potential for

906
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:52,280
um um carbon dioxide removal for the

907
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:56,319
production of international offsets um

908
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,640
is it Latin America and Africa um some

909
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:00,760
other regions as well but those are the

910
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:02,119
key players there and if they um for

911
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:07,520
those

912
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:11,400
regions to get the the most um I guess

913
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:14,800
bang for their Buck they would have to

914
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:19,359
Abate themselves within their countries

915
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:22,000
um and deploy the CDR because if they if

916
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,880
they didn't do their own abatement um

917
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,880
they would have to use up all of their

918
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,119
CDR to offset their emissions to meet

919
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,960
their own targets so if you want to be

920
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:35,000
able to have enough to actually sell to

921
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,760
so while also meeting your target you

922
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:43,440
have to Abate too um and so the in our

923
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:47,160
analyses um beex bioenergy with ccs is a

924
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:50,000
is a real um winner in terms of the

925
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:52,200
economics um and for a lot of places at

926
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,280
least initially in the near-term um

927
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,280
aforestation and reforestation which

928
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:00,720
would mean in our World's new addition

929
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:04,319
to Forest rather than promising not to

930
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:07,359
Deforest what is currently there um is

931
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:10,119
aforestation really coste effective um

932
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:12,720
with the caveat of the challenges of of

933
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:16,000
permanence um how long are we promising

934
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,119
to keep those new forests there and can

935
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:22,480
we even make that promise um given

936
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:25,319
natural disasters Etc um so a lot of

937
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,240
question marks um but again a lot of

938
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:33,800
interest and potential to

939
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:34,880
really mitigate well mitigate the cost

940
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:39,559
of

941
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:42,440
mitigation um so yes yeah uh you

942
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:47,079
mentioned the DAC the direct air capture

943
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:49,280
is was one of the uh carbon netive

944
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:51,960
technology options uh you know lots of

945
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,760
talking about that you know in your

946
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:58,000
models

947
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:59,920
uh I guess that option must be very

948
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,880
expensive at this point because some

949
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:08,119
dynamically it's just uh uh pretty hard

950
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:13,160
to uh uh capture CO2 from 400 PPM

951
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:16,240
air uh any comments there uh whether I

952
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:20,200
they will become a real impactful

953
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:23,920
Technology Solutions um yes um I would

954
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:27,079
encourage everyone if you go to today's

955
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:31,200
um homepage for the MIT energy initia

956
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:35,480
itive um on the homepage is an article

957
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:39,280
um describing our recent commentary

958
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:42,119
about um getting real on direct air

959
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:45,240
capture um which reflects the opinion of

960
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:48,000
myself and um Howard Herzog who's a

961
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,280
world-renowned expert in CCS

962
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,680
Technologies um as well as um Sergey

963
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:56,599
pulv and Angelo gel and our our main

964
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:59,720
message that we wanted to portray in

965
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:03,040
that piece is that

966
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:04,160
the physics behind direct air capture

967
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:08,040
prevent

968
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:10,800
some serious challenges that make some

969
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,720
of these lowcost estimates extremely

970
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,480
unrealistic and if we account for those

971
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:19,839
challenges such as the extremely diluted

972
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,559
concentration in the atmosphere the high

973
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:27,119
amount of energy that's needed to run

974
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:28,640
these processes um the scale of the size

975
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,920
of the infrastructure that would be

976
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:34,559
needed um then if we really account for

977
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,319
those the more realistic cost of these

978
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,520
of direct air capture is more in the

979
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:41,760
range of$ 600 to $1,000 per ton CO2

980
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,760
which is just not competitive and while

981
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:46,559
there may be some room for improvement

982
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,559
and lower cost there's always going to

983
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,359
be those challenges of the laws of

984
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:53,240
thermodynamics that are going to prevent

985
00:47:50,359 --> 00:47:56,119
you from getting too low um so that's at

986
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:58,359
least our our our projection until maybe

987
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:01,680
we have some techn technology Revolution

988
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:03,559
um in the area but for now um the the

989
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:07,160
even with a multiple variations of

990
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:10,920
direct air caption capture options um we

991
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:14,400
see it as as expensive yeah okay thanks

992
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:18,240
Jennifer uh obviously uh a lots of good

993
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,240
questions and good answers
