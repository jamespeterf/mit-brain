1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,200
okay let's uh let's get started right on

2
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,760
time both to set a good precedent and

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,359
there's quite a bit uh to do today um I

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,160
will put that back down for one second

5
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:26,320
so that those who just got in can see

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,679
the agenda for today

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,439
um uh first first two things will just

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,879
be a minute or two and then we'll spend

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,559
the rest of the time on um you know what

10
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,760
everybody thinks is the coolest thing uh

11
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,480
in the world these days in computation

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,039
artificial intelligence and machine

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,840
learning um but this is not a class in

14
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:50,239
that uh we'll spend most of our time on

15
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,520
uh feature extraction the necessary evil

16
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,840
before uh doing great things with

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,920
artificial intelligence and machine

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,160
learning when you're dealing with data

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,199
that's not already uh numbers uh I want

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,600
to do a really quick uh discussion on um

21
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,240
something on problem set 78 uh I'm still

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,560
listening to the composition some of

23
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,400
them are really really cool uh just

24
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,720
they're all they're all a great that

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,960
I've heard so far but uh some really

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,880
went into it um but there was one um

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,759
thing that um among people who attempted

28
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:28,159
every problem um ended up being a

29
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:31,560
consistent eror what actually two things

30
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:35,240
uh one that a lot lot of people um

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,320
missed here was in um let's say you were

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,159
in C major because that'll make life

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:45,399
sort of easier I gave some chords that

34
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:49,240
were like

35
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:51,920
this and uh what do we call this in C

36
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,439
major what's the SC if Roman numeral

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,799
we're doing the Roman numeral exercise

38
00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:00,159
for a second what's uh what's scale

39
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,719
degree two good and what is the the

40
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,399
quality of the chord di diminish great

41
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,239
um so you don't have your problem Set uh

42
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,599
back for two reasons one the a couple

43
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,959
more songs I'm listening to and also so

44
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:15,519
how would we write two

45
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:20,920
diminished Circle yeah and then I

46
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:23,879
noticed that my thing said or if it's um

47
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,879
or if it's seven

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,800
diminished write this and I did not say

49
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,599
um in general if it's diminished write

50
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,920
this so I think that some people seem to

51
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,800
write specific code for um making sure

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,239
that only happened on seven but two

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,400
diminished happens quite often um how

54
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:49,000
does it happen in C major you're

55
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,560
borrowing from C minor for a little

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,519
bit so these borrowed

57
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,200
chords either flat and natural and then

58
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,200
you end up with that

59
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,720
DF a flat chord so that's where that

60
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,000
comes in but I want to make sure I'm

61
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,760
going to go back because there was an

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,280
ambiguity in the instructions I want to

63
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,239
make sure that everybody gets um the

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,319
little point back who made that who

65
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,959
didn't put that in okay so that was one

66
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,720
of the two systematic uh issues and that

67
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,200
came from an ambiguity for me here is

68
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,400
the other one that came up a lot that um

69
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:31,760
I want to sort of address um oh yeah so

70
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,760
so we just went from C major

71
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,080
and we

72
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:40,610
played that two diminished

73
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:44,879
sound then what about this

74
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:49,519
[Music]

75
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:55,239
sound anyone identify that chord by

76
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:58,720
ear just the what's that augmented

77
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:02,920
great good I was

78
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,480
in doing that borrowing from minor thing

79
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,439
and I left my blue pen which probably

80
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,360
shows up better um I was borrowing from

81
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,879
minor and I started on the third scale

82
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,319
degree and so this was not part of your

83
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:18,000
Roman numeral thing but it came on the

84
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,000
roots

85
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:27,600
question what is the root of that

86
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,280
chord no it could not ah we'll get to

87
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,560
that that's where where something

88
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,039
happens yep exactly it's great great

89
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:38,520
idea John E flat E flat now we'll get

90
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,720
we'll get to it in just a second what is

91
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,720
the

92
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,479
root of that

93
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:56,000
chord g

94
00:04:51,720 --> 00:05:00,039
g and let's see if I can make one um

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,039
we'll go back to our E flat

96
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,080
what is the root of that

97
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:12,199
one C flat C flat now why is it and so

98
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,199
just just so we all have it in our ears

99
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,199
again

100
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,319
um three chords three exact same sound

101
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,759
but Roots the concept of root is

102
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:30,880
something that comes from a a triotic um

103
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,160
sort of a spelling enabled thing so

104
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,280
where do we find the root we talked

105
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,440
about the algorithm last time what do we

106
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,880
want to find a bunch of

107
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,000
stacked thirds good I heard it so

108
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,840
stacked thirds so here we have a third

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,880
followed by a third or a third and a

110
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,840
fifth depending on how you're counting

111
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,240
but here what's this

112
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,400
interval diminished diminished fourth

113
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,240
yeah a fourth of some sort so we have to

114
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,360
move it up the

115
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:05,280
octave in order to get our stacked

116
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,800
thir and here um we can move them both

117
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,440
up an

118
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,280
octave in order to get our stack thirds

119
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,440
so the diminished uh the augmented Triad

120
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:18,800
is the one of the places where the um

121
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,840
the concept of root has everything to do

122
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,400
with spelling there's one other very

123
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,520
common chord where the concept of root

124
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:31,400
has everything to do with

125
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:34,280
Spelling saw a big smile uh it's a

126
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,360
Triad diminish seven diminish seventh

127
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,720
chord yeah um here I'll just keep it in

128
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,400
the light assuming that's good so yeah

129
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,680
diminish seventh chord let's say we're

130
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,479
in c minor we're going

131
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,919
to start one

132
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,880
B what somebody shout out the next note

133
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,400
d

134
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,800
d f and

135
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:06,080
then a flat yeah so seven do with a root

136
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:09,720
on B but we can change this to move it

137
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,720
up an octave and flip the

138
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,639
enharmonic and suddenly we have third

139
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,879
third

140
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:22,240
third and our root

141
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,639
becomes D we got a lot more to get

142
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,520
through today so I will leave it to um

143
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,039
attest to prove to yourself that we can

144
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:34,319
keep doing this somehow and get all uh

145
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:37,759
every one of the four notes as a um as a

146
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,599
a diminished uh as having its own that

147
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,520
note as a root so each of the chord

148
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,000
factors depending on how you spell and

149
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,720
that's one of the reasons by the way

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,919
this gets away from the computational

151
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,919
side but maybe a cool computational

152
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,120
compositional tool one of the reasons

153
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,400
why a diminished seventh chord is often

154
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,280
a very useful way to modulate to remote

155
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,440
keys because you just sort of start

156
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,159
emphasizing a different note as your

157
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:05,199
root

158
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:07,479
okay any questions on this or on other

159
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,319
things well eager to get to feature

160
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:13,159
extraction on this there should be um

161
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:20,560
there should be a a notebook that says

162
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:24,639
um under today um 2023 AI template

163
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,840
lank that one is it it's there good good

164
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,000
good so feel free to download that and

165
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,919
put that where you are and um

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,320
and run it it will install uh if your

167
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:39,240
hard drive is almost completely full it

168
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,680
will install um a a learning tool kit

169
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,240
called orange which also in installs

170
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,680
another machine learning tool kit called

171
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,480
s kit learn and I think they might be a

172
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,959
little bit big might be whatever so uh

173
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,839
make sure to run all um first and that

174
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:58,959
will uh get you in a pretty decent uh

175
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,640
shape I'm going to get started on what

176
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,880
we're talking about today is um

177
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,760
something called feature extraction and

178
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,920
so feature extraction is a conversion of

179
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:15,399
elements in this case musical elements

180
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,600
into single numbers or lists arrays

181
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,040
vectors tensors whatever you want to

182
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,680
call them of

183
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,839
numbers it is the most boring thing I

184
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,399
will teach in the class and please don't

185
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,600
correct me if you're like you there's

186
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,040
plenty of other boring things you've

187
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,760
done but no it's it's really one of the

188
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,240
most boring things in the world and um

189
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,600
here's a reason to hate it um it really

190
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,600
sucks the lifeblood out of Music

191
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,640
everything that you love about music is

192
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,200
going to be converted into a few numbers

193
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,640
uh it is Tes the life off it is the

194
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,120
zombie of Music World Adam's very

195
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,440
excited yes Zombie Invasion uh but

196
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,240
there's a lot of amazing things we know

197
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,959
happening in artificial intelligence

198
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,480
machine learning deep learning

199
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,440
algorithms all these things and as as

200
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,480
far as I know they all have one thing in

201
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,760
common and that is they work on

202
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,240
collection big collections of

203
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,079
numbers um you know there's there's some

204
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,760
ways that you can work with um you know

205
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,440
images that effectively are kind of like

206
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,959
two or multi-dimensional arrays of

207
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,560
numbers but basically they're all going

208
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:27,920
to be numbers so you know when I when I

209
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,920
put some music notation on the

210
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,279
board we're not going to be able to work

211
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,200
with that even an image of it even a

212
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,160
JPEG unless we convert it to pixels and

213
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,399
convert it to numbers when you hear a

214
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,519
sound something like that you're going

215
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,279
to have to convert that into numbers in

216
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:48,120
some

217
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:50,880
ways so we're going to be just working

218
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,800
on converting things to numbers so uh

219
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:58,959
it's pretty simple and um

220
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,839
but how to do it and what to extract and

221
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:05,079
how to make your extractions is sort of

222
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:07,480
the the Deep art that takes a while now

223
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,680
um I I'll get to a little bit later um

224
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,600
some of the things that people are doing

225
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,920
today where feature extraction is less

226
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,519
or careful feature extraction is less

227
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,720
important and I'll tell you what those

228
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:21,880
things tend to have in common and that

229
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,800
is their um they work on much bigger

230
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:28,000
data sets than um than what we have so

231
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,079
we're g to get started on um this yep

232
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,200
that's my template here and we're going

233
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:36,839
to start with uh why not we always start

234
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:40,040
with our favorite Bach caral what's the

235
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:45,200
number 66.6

236
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:50,600
66.6 conjure up the bwv

237
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,600
66.6 I'm going to show it get it back

238
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:08,279
okay great oh feel um so we're going to

239
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:10,839
do some manual feature extraction first

240
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,480
we're going to convert this into numbers

241
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:16,360
I'm going to extract two things from

242
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:21,160
this number of parts and initial number

243
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:23,639
of beats per measure so let's just do

244
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,440
our super you don't have to type this if

245
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:29,720
you want num Parts equals 4 time

246
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,800
signature numerator equals 4 there I

247
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:36,920
have done manual feature extraction and

248
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,440
describing the piece as two numbers um

249
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,519
they seem to look like four four but I

250
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,800
didn't ever extract the denominator that

251
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,120
just happens to be coincidence they're

252
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,160
both four so I don't know if we'd even

253
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,279
call this feature extraction but you can

254
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,519
see it's it's pretty you know we were

255
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:57,959
not talking about very very much here so

256
00:12:53,519 --> 00:13:00,760
I'm going to um Define uh a an automatic

257
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:03,560
feature extractor so we call it extract

258
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,519
meter and extract meter you can save

259
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,680
time by not putting these annotations it

260
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,279
takes in some sort of a stream I'm

261
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,600
calling it score even though um it's not

262
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,680
and returns two integers what do you

263
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,880
think the two inte are going to

264
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,680
be if you're extracting the

265
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,440
meter numerator and denominator great

266
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,600
super so we can say all the meters in

267
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,480
the piece equals the score meter time

268
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,600
signature re

269
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,880
curse and um the first one we'll just

270
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,720
get the first one first meter all

271
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:46,199
meters

272
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,079
zero and we'll return first

273
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:52,320
meters

274
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,639
numerator and first meters denominator I

275
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,360
know I don't need the parenthesis but I

276
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:01,360
just kind of got used to that

277
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,440
it's all let

278
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,440
people get caught up um now by the way

279
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,839
uh how many time signatures does this

280
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,680
little Corral have are we going Overkill

281
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,680
by getting the first

282
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,639
one want to take a guess you all know it

283
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,639
by now

284
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,600
one actually has four the way music 21

285
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:33,160
counts 1 2 3 they're all the same but

286
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,399
this is an error I make quite a bit

287
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,360
often that each of the parts has its own

288
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,920
time signature so this is uh something

289
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,120
to be careful on and now we'll get to

290
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,519
the first sort of ethical dilemma of um

291
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,440
of feature extraction and machine

292
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,160
learning of which there will be many um

293
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:54,279
and quite a number today uh what happens

294
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,759
if a score doesn't have any time

295
00:14:54,279 --> 00:15:00,040
signatures do we want this will this

296
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:02,120
crash first off

297
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,360
and if you think it will crash tell me

298
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,560
what the error that's probably going to

299
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,560
be

300
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,000
returned out list index out of range or

301
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:16,079
index error yep that we're trying to get

302
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,680
zero so we can say um something

303
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:23,800
like if not all meters now so here's the

304
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,480
ethical dilemma I'm going to return 0

305
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:30,680
comma 0 as a special value that's also

306
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,639
in integer uh to of two integers that

307
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,600
says I have no time signature because

308
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:38,639
you know I'm I'm raised as a medieval

309
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,639
musicologist so I have Gregorian chant

310
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:45,519
lying around and other meterless time um

311
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:48,560
pieces but um the other reason is that

312
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:52,720
we sometimes in case of an error or an

313
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,959
outof bound value we return some sort of

314
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,759
we call of Sentinel some kind of special

315
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,880
meaning number that says you know some

316
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,000
sort of an error happened

317
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,040
why because you're going to someday have

318
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,680
a gigantic data set maybe you're going

319
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,000
to be doing this up in the cloud

320
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,360
somewhere or something and you're going

321
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,680
to have

322
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,839
um uh you're going to be letting it run

323
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,399
overnight consuming a huge amount of

324
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:21,199
processor money and eventually there's

325
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,759
going to be some bad data in there

326
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,959
that's going to crash your

327
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:28,959
system and you want to be like okay I

328
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:30,519
just let this run for 47 hours and uh

329
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,680
now I have to start all over again

330
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:33,920
because of course I didn't save

331
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,399
intermediary values because you know I'm

332
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,360
a theoretical person not a practical

333
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,360
programmer but um always say write write

334
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,319
to dis every once in a while um

335
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,440
but so so this type of thing helps to

336
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:49,560
save you from a little bit of bad data

337
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,040
what it also does though is it can

338
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,880
swallow up systematic errors in your

339
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:58,000
thought you know what I'm saying that

340
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,720
that you didn't realize that um the one

341
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,199
that I always get is I'm looking at the

342
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,240
pitch of everything in the piece I pitch

343
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:07,039
of everything in there and then I forget

344
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,919
that these structures called chords

345
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,160
exist which don't just have a pitch they

346
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:14,199
have multiple and so I could end up

347
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,480
silently throwing out all of my data

348
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,280
about chords rather than realizing I

349
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,559
have a mental model problem in there and

350
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,919
this is some of the things that um that

351
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:27,199
can lead to uh AI that doesn't include

352
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,160
all of us that programmers forget that

353
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,559
women exist or that nonwhite people

354
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,640
exist and therefore oh that's data

355
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:35,760
that's out of bounds so you know we'll

356
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,000
we'll go with a default response rather

357
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,080
than learning um you know how to deal

358
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,160
with uh facial recognition on things

359
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,120
like that so here it's not such a big I

360
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,000
don't think that we're um you know that

361
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,840
we're going to have a problem with um

362
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,039
systematically discriminating against

363
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,320
Gregorian chant but um but it's these

364
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,919
kinds of issues that lead to so many of

365
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,000
the other uh ethical issues um in in

366
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,200
artificial

367
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,360
intelligence okay with that aside we've

368
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,320
all caught up let's see did I somebody

369
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,000
and everybody just save me time when I

370
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,280
type something wrong um check it but

371
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,679
let's see if that

372
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:21,400
works extract meter Bo we have our

373
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:24,360
first um our first uh automatic feature

374
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,600
extractor is this topic so far as boring

375
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,280
as I

376
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,000
promised no okay somebody likes it yeah

377
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,520
I I it's it's pretty good but let's

378
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,120
let's go with something else and we're

379
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,840
going to start with another ethical

380
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:40,200
dilemma we're going to be working with

381
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Ryan's Mammoth collection and I think um

382
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,880
if you type blooming you should get

383
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,320
something that's not an error do you

384
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,679
because you've already if you've run

385
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,880
everything you've already run Corpus

386
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,400
parse blooming

387
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,960
Meadows

388
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,280
jig and let's see

389
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,720
that so apologies we didn't get to The

390
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,200
Jig um composition yet I do plan to pick

391
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,760
that up next week but I figure that

392
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,679
there's some other things that people

393
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,640
need for their final projects more

394
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:14,240
importantly than uh working with that um

395
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,799
so you all see something like

396
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,280
this but we're going to be back on jigs

397
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,400
again today for a bit now Ryan's Mammoth

398
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,400
collection is a little bit of an ethical

399
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,200
dilemma and I'm trying to replace it it

400
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:32,799
is a collection of a think something

401
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:36,200
like uh 1, 79 fiddle Tunes from the 19th

402
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,200
century um that has a bunch of jigs horn

403
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:43,320
pipes uh things that if you take uh Joe

404
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,440
Mor's um C shanties and um English folk

405
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:50,080
music class and all those things you you

406
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,720
can learn more about them um it also is

407
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,880
a large collection of musical

408
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,480
experiences of 19th century

409
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,159
African-Americans that has been um sort

410
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,240
of parody

411
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:06,480
and or um appropriated into white

412
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:09,760
minstral shows so I've tried to remove

413
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,640
um things that are um

414
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,320
offensive on First Sight from The

415
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,360
Collection titles and things like that

416
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,760
but um but the deeper history a lot of

417
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,600
these songs has to do with a lot of

418
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,799
appropriation so um I'm hoping to be

419
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,280
able to get a collection to replace it

420
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:30,840
at some point because um you know it's

421
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,640
not exactly everything I want to do with

422
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,520
it but anyhow so we have for um for

423
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,320
going through we have the one jig

424
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:43,120
blooming Meadows jig and um I gave you

425
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:45,320
just a contrast um uh a real

426
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,960
reel um and you should already have the

427
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,520
Reel I think uh already loaded so you

428
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,200
don't need to type this it's called the

429
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,400
seventh regiment

430
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,400
reel and hopefully I got

431
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,960
that and it looks a little a little bit

432
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,360
different so what we're going to do

433
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,320
today is try to build a system that can

434
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:14,720
tell the difference between a jig and a

435
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:17,520
reel or jig and uh we'll defit it into

436
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:21,039
the remaining 52 minutes between a jig

437
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,760
and a not jig the whole all of music is

438
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:28,960
divided into Jigs and not jigs it's

439
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:31,320
great um okay so we um we'll be looking

440
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,559
how would you how would you define the

441
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,240
difference you can look down at your own

442
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:38,120
so I don't have to keep scrolling back

443
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,279
and forth um just if if you're somebody

444
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:45,360
who didn't know hadn't encountered a

445
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:47,880
real or a jig before what is the um what

446
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,440
would you say is an obvious

447
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:55,559
difference Matthew you uh 24 versus 68

448
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,559
24 versus 68 good another

449
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:02,000
obvious one I think what's that is the S

450
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,960
one the time signature the same same one

451
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,520
time signature good

452
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,559
yeah seems more syn which one seems more

453
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,320
synr The Jig The Jig a little bit more

454
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:15,440
syncopated especially um things there's

455
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,320
always things like this that are not

456
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,679
technically rhythmically syncopated but

457
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:24,919
kind of feel a little bit

458
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:29,440
um good anything else

459
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:31,600
yeah what's that 16 16th versus 8th

460
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,200
notes thank you I'm going to put that in

461
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm also going to disable my uh my what

462
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,320
do you call it my

463
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,440
notifications supposed to

464
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,840
happen automatically okay yeah 16th

465
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,520
versus e8th notes we're actually going

466
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:49,360
to uh possibly use that as as something

467
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,720
so we're going to try to um have a

468
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,880
system that can do the difference you

469
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,360
should have if you type Ryan uh you

470
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,039
should be you should be getting

471
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,039
something I'm going to really quickly um

472
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,159
just cut and paste what I did to get to

473
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:07,000
Ryan and explain it I first created a

474
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,600
sign called Ryan M where I find

475
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
everything in Ryan's Mammoth collection

476
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,919
and then what I've

477
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,120
done is here's another cut and paste

478
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:21,400
1059 I think yep is that I've gone

479
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,880
through everything in there and said

480
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,159
first off I only want to look at the

481
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,039
first 500 of them and then I'm looking

482
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,720
without parsing if the name name of the

483
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,919
file has jig in

484
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,200
it um if it doesn't have jig in it and

485
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:40,279
if you're over file 100 continue so I've

486
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,919
why did I do all this stuff just so that

487
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:46,440
I can get something that is

488
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:51,039
approximately 50/50 jig not Jake um so

489
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:55,400
we end up with about 200 U here I

490
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:58,600
can we end up with 212 pieces and I

491
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,600
happen to know that 59% of them are jigs

492
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:04,000
so uh that's pretty good these are all

493
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,960
what we call uh metadata entries so they

494
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:12,039
haven't been parsed

495
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:15,080
yet okay great everybody with me there

496
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:19,120
great I'm going to Define um a helper

497
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:21,080
function that is how many ethical

498
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,559
dilemas are we doing today uh this one's

499
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:27,799
not ethical but this one's sort of a

500
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:31,520
research thing called is jig which um

501
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:36,760
which determines if something is a jig

502
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:38,760
by looking at the file name and um lower

503
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:43,679
casing it and seeing if the word jig is

504
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:46,520
in that um I've done this with uh Rags

505
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:49,600
before uh rag time a really great um

506
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,760
piano genre most Scott Joplin the most

507
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,840
famous person and a lot of Rags have um

508
00:24:52,760 --> 00:25:00,320
rag in the title Maple Leaf Rag and so

509
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,320
on but then there's like the entertain

510
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:05,159
you know that which doesn't have the

511
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:09,600
word rag in the title so we're

512
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:13,320
possibly having what we call a bad

513
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:17,720
ground truth the ground truth is the

514
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:21,200
definition that is correct beforehand

515
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,679
and so is this song a jig is this not a

516
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,840
jig this is probably not the greatest

517
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,840
ground truth there the other thing that

518
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:32,520
will come up a lot is that there is a

519
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,200
some pieces that will be very hard to

520
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,760
tell if they are and two different

521
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,480
intelligent people could disagree on

522
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,399
something that's a jig this comes up a

523
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,520
lot in genre classification where people

524
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:50,039
can't really decide is this country or

525
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:54,120
is this rock is this uh Funk is this hip

526
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:58,399
hop is this romantic is this classical

527
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,360
um so you know somebody once told me um

528
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:02,399
when they realized I came from a music

529
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,440
history training musicology that they

530
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:06,559
said the worst part about musicologists

531
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,960
getting into this field is that they

532
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:12,039
give us really crappy ground truths you

533
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,080
know you all won't say what the right

534
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:18,799
answer is and that's I hope an ambiguity

535
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:22,559
we like as humans but anyhow so we'll

536
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:26,960
we'll have our is jig let's um we'll

537
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:29,279
actually see um is jig blooming I think

538
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,760
that was the one that is jig and what

539
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,440
was the other one uh

540
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,799
real okay

541
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:42,360
so so with our garbage in garbage out

542
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:46,000
terrible ground truth um we seems to be

543
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,919
working okay and I happen to know 127 of

544
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,799
the things in there jig so let's get our

545
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,039
second feature extractor this one's

546
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:54,080
going to be pretty easy we'll just get

547
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,320
the number of sharps in the piece uh we

548
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,200
started working on jigs in G so we

549
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,840
happen to know that there are a whole

550
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,799
bunch of them so maybe we'll do this and

551
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,600
here we can just do again a try return

552
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:09,240
the

553
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,880
scores key key

554
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,039
signature the number of

555
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,159
Sharps uh if it's two Flats what's it

556
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:18,960
going to

557
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:21,640
return negative -2 yep great so and if

558
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,880
there's no key signature um this one's

559
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,919
actually not a terrible assumption right

560
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,480
something without a key signature

561
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,200
probably has a key signature of no

562
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,240
sharps or flat

563
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,360
I no maybe maybe we should in this case

564
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,279
analyze the key and uh do something like

565
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:40,120
that but good enough for a little bit so

566
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:44,919
let's see um the

567
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:48,279
blooming hopefully this will return one

568
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:50,240
oops oh I know what I did this is why

569
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:54,200
you should never do something like this

570
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,840
uh except index error we

571
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,640
said and we didn't get an index error

572
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:02,000
what did we get we got a attribute error

573
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,159
yep there is no Sharps cuz I forgot to

574
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,399
say that we want the first key

575
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:10,320
signatures Sharps you can also do the do

576
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:13,720
zero or bracket zero however you'd like

577
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,679
that and so let me try the get Sharps

578
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,679
again getting one and what's the answer

579
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,279
for

580
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:23,159
Bach three good you can either do that

581
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,640
by hand or make sure thing work great

582
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:29,320
and let's we'll Define one more feature

583
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:32,200
extractor so that we can um

584
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:35,360
oops we're actually making good time

585
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:38,559
this uh we'll do eighth fraction uh

586
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,279
based on based on the observation that

587
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,840
there's uh more eighth notes in some in

588
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:46,080
one piece than the other so we'll take

589
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,559
in a stream. score and this time we'll

590
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,080
return a float so usually you can um

591
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:55,200
return an INT which we call a continuous

592
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,720
a a discrete VAR answer or a float which

593
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,360
is continuous variable so let's just do

594
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,919
this get the number of notes in the

595
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,519
piece actually you do this you give me

596
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,880
go ahead and try try coding this for a

597
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,519
little bit because we are a couple

598
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:11,039
minutes ahead of time how do we get

599
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:16,000
the returns the fra you I need to put

600
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:20,000
this Returns the fraction of notes in a

601
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
score that are eighth

602
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:28,919
notes okay you can keep doing yours if

603
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:31,360
you're stuck I'm going to give what I to

604
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,360
sign

605
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:52,360
like not the most efficient use of

606
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:52,360
iterators I've done two

607
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,960
I'm uh where am I missing it it's

608
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:20,440
somewhere in eths right

609
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:24,080
where eight yep eight thank you

610
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,080
appreciate that

611
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:39,679
and go ahead and run your num a on

612
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:42,039
blooming on real and unb and use your

613
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:46,080
spidey sense to figure out if the if

614
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:49,399
your numbers are um pretty meaningful if

615
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,440
there's anything I can I can get from

616
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:55,159
this class to just use in all of your

617
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:59,600
programming things is always um use your

618
00:30:55,159 --> 00:31:02,000
intuition to see if something like that

619
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:07,039
something

620
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:11,639
is uh working right woo wow look at

621
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:14,399
that the real is incredibly low

622
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:15,799
oops uh now I have too many eighth

623
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,720
fraction I should have done it eth's

624
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:19,720
fraction but whatever

625
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:27,200
I'm that actually feels too low for that

626
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,919
reel only 8% but I guess there's a lot

627
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,919
of 16th

628
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:36,120
okay give me a snap if you're ready to

629
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:40,320
move on okay hearing some snaps not all

630
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,320
we'll give another 10 seconds or

631
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:49,200
so so so far we have we have the first

632
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:51,440
one that seems you know really to give

633
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,639
at least in this one piece a big

634
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:59,639
distinction among the three um

635
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:59,639
types oops

636
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,799
okay now I'm going to we uh wade into

637
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:09,159
something that people don't um always

638
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,120
say is this a feature extractor because

639
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:12,880
it returns a number or something or is

640
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,440
when you put them all together is that

641
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,919
the feature extractor I'm not sure but

642
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,919
I'll use this term so the feature

643
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,880
extractor is going to run all of our

644
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,960
different little feature extractors and

645
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,000
in this case I'm going to say it's going

646
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,200
to return a tuple of I'll tell you what

647
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,720
these are in a bit but here I'll write

648
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:38,799
this out here a string two inss a float

649
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,799
and int and an

650
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:46,440
INT what are these going to

651
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:48,720
be they're going to be the file name

652
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,200
which is pure metadata just so we can

653
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,960
look at things later they're going to be

654
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,000
the numerator and the

655
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,639
denominator of the um of the piece using

656
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,039
our function we wrote extract me met

657
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:02,080
they going to be what's the only thing

658
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:05,519
we've written that has a returns a float

659
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,960
as the answer what's that eth yeah eth

660
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,880
fraction eth proportion whatever we're

661
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,840
going to call it um the number of

662
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,799
Sharps and then that last one we'll get

663
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:19,960
to that's going to be the ground truth

664
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:22,639
um and doing too much Json I stopped

665
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,440
doing trailing commas okay so the file

666
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:27,399
name um you get this from a scores

667
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,159
metadata object which we haven't really

668
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:33,279
talked about it's file

669
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,880
path split I'm just going to get the

670
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,799
last bit so I'm not showing my entire um

671
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,200
directory R Tree to everything so I'll

672
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:42,320
just get the last thing after the slash

673
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:45,720
those of you who know Python's path

674
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:49,320
Library you can probably do better

675
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:52,080
um the numerator and the

676
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:55,840
denominator will

677
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:59,760
extract meter from the

678
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:03,399
score the eths we'll say is the

679
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:07,480
eighth fraction of the

680
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:10,240
score Sharp's feature is get Sharps you

681
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,560
can call them whatever you'd like

682
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,280
and then the ground

683
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:19,639
truth is it a jig or is it

684
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:23,599
not but it has to be a number so we'll

685
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:27,760
say integer of is

686
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:31,119
jig you could also say um if you like

687
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,639
this python one if if jig else zero

688
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,679
that's sometimes uh sometimes explicits

689
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,720
a little bit nicer to see what that's

690
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:42,280
going to be and then we want to return

691
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:45,879
all that file name numerator

692
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:49,399
denominator eth I should do quarters I

693
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:52,040
can spell quarter feature and ground

694
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:56,560
truth I'll let everybody get caught up

695
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:59,280
while I debug my own system whoa some

696
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,720
fast typists in this class feature

697
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:08,440
extractor on Bach let me just see

698
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:11,440
feature extractor on uh

699
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,440
blooming

700
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,680
okay ABC file extension yep yeah a lot

701
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,280
of these are all written as ABC files do

702
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,920
we we didn't really cover no we didn't

703
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,800
cover ABC files because they're um

704
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,839
they're tiny bit more complex than the

705
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,200
easiest to encode handwritten things but

706
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:37,520
not um not complex enough for uh as like

707
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,240
music XML or

708
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:44,720
something okay so blooming Metals jig

709
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:47,599
it's in 68 77% of its uh notes are

710
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,400
eighth notes it's in one sharp and that

711
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:54,839
last one indicates what

712
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:58,079
again yep so the one indicates jig right

713
00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:01,400
great Okay so

714
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,920
um what I'm going to do right now is I'm

715
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:07,839
just going to run this for a second uh

716
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,359
so how would I get everything so we can

717
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,960
do

718
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:14,680
metadata I'm just doing this so we can

719
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:19,960
kind of see how we do this in the Ryan

720
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:22,520
thing piece equals metadata entry. parse

721
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,680
and then we'll print the feature

722
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:29,560
extractor on the

723
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,560
piece and you can kind of see

724
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,560
yep uh because of the way I did it uh

725
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:43,200
you'll see that at first there's not too

726
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:45,920
many Jigs and then later on there's

727
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,960
jigs okay

728
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,280
um now if you um scroll back up to the

729
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,280
top of yours sorry I'm going to have to

730
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:58,280
get my blank template for a second oops

731
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,760
that's way smaller um there should be uh

732
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,960
on the top of your template if you

733
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,839
downloaded it something called WR

734
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:08,920
Ryan and um you just need to change your

735
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:12,240
path to someplace that you're going to

736
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:14,200
be able to remember it so change that

737
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,720
unless you have a unless you've created

738
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,960
a cprit user because it makes it easier

739
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,359
for you to cut and paste my code um

740
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,160
probably want to change that and then

741
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:24,440
you can run run this while I explain a

742
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:29,160
little bit what it

743
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:33,319
is um okay is Right Ryan working for

744
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,319
people when you get that

745
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,160
okay

746
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,280
great so I'm going

747
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:46,839
to have my own version

748
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,920
here the right in command

749
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,319
W you don't have to do any of this it'll

750
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,720
be kind of fun because then you'll have

751
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:09,720
right

752
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,720
underscore

753
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,280
Ryan and

754
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,240
sorry okay I've seen more people waiting

755
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:22,680
than typing for a little bit so I'll

756
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,720
just s of explain what we do U some of

757
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,800
these things if you work with files you

758
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,440
probably know them pretty well uh this

759
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,240
is really not necessarily the best way

760
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,720
to do this but I'm going to open two

761
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,920
files one of them is the file that we're

762
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:39,040
going to use to train um our classifier

763
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,680
the thing that is going to try to learn

764
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,560
if something is a jig or not the other

765
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:48,920
one is the file we're going to do to try

766
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:52,520
to test whether it can do it um no or

767
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:55,480
not we're going to hope that um that we

768
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,160
don't put the same data into both so

769
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,319
we're going to try to put some data in

770
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,800
the testing somay in the training

771
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:04,319
there's a number of different ways you

772
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,760
can do this type of work um you put 90%

773
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:09,599
in the testing in the training and 10%

774
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,359
in the testing SI you put 50/50 which is

775
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,640
what we're going to do uh some of it has

776
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:17,680
to do with how much data you have

777
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,440
um so what I'm going to do it maybe

778
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,480
it'll be easier to see I'm just going to

779
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,839
separate. tab means everything's going

780
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:27,040
to be separated by tabs so I'm going to

781
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:29,000
first put a header line that says the

782
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,880
name of the columns these are just for

783
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,839
us to read so we have a file name

784
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,240
numerator denominator a sharp and is jig

785
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:39,040
and so we're going to write that to the

786
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,040
top of it because a lot of the um

787
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,079
classifiers that work on Tab data expect

788
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,640
this to be the first line now we're

789
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,880
going to hope that when running this

790
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,079
system that uh it doesn't Peak at the

791
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,640
file name and we'll see because that

792
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:55,119
since obviously file name would give it

793
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,680
away um and then so the descriptions

794
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,040
what kind of data is this the file names

795
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,920
a string then we have discret as we said

796
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,599
for an integer discret continuous

797
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,400
discret discret so we'll write that out

798
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:12,000
again to each of the different um things

799
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,480
the the two files and then we have most

800
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,119
a third line which is mostly blank for

801
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,599
all these things and the first one just

802
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:21,720
says metadata um that is to say don't

803
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,599
Peak at the file name do not use the

804
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:27,880
file name to try to classify this then

805
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:29,839
normal information and then the class

806
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,359
the thing that we're trying to figure

807
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,480
out and we really really hope that um

808
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,920
the artificial intelligence uh thing

809
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,400
does not uh Peak at the class when it's

810
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,640
trying to look you can really really

811
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,480
quickly create an incredible AI thing if

812
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,160
you would allow it to peek and so we'll

813
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,240
put that out so that's just all headers

814
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,240
and that's why I didn't want to spend

815
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,640
too much time writing it then what are

816
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,960
we going to do same thing they were

817
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,440
saying before we're just going to get

818
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,240
each piece into there and I've done

819
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,040
enumerate for a reason so I can keep

820
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,440
track of what the piece number is um and

821
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,680
then we can extract the piece uh all the

822
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,640
features from it and then we'll just

823
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,000
write them out um in this case we're

824
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,680
going to write them as a string because

825
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,960
we can only write strings out to a text

826
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,640
file um write each of the features out

827
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,000
tab separated actually we'll get get

828
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,079
ready to write it we'll just put it into

829
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,560
a string and then um every other one

830
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:29,079
we're going to write to training and

831
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,319
test training and test probably another

832
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:33,160
way to do it would be to flip a coin

833
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:35,400
each time and use a random number so you

834
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:38,440
can see uh if things are going there I'm

835
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,079
not an expert on on this type of work

836
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,960
but um that's how that works I don't

837
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,920
think

838
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,040
I yeah I don't think I'm going to run it

839
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,119
now because I should have been running

840
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,000
it during this time uh you know what I'm

841
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,560
just going to put train

842
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,319
data X and Test data X so that while

843
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:01,560
it's running I have access to um

844
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:04,560
to our baked one so I can actually we

845
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:07,400
can look at it uh you know magic feature

846
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,040
so we switch out of python and immediate

847
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:14,880
and um look at the Shell for a

848
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,359
second train data wherever you put your

849
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:22,079
thing and I can

850
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:24,119
see that I've written out it's kind of

851
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,839
weird that the tabs don't show up you

852
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:27,359
would love to have something that would

853
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,920
automatically put it out but we have the

854
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:34,520
file name all our headers description of

855
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:36,800
the data the metadata here and then um

856
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,760
yeah we have our um all of our

857
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,960
information written out so that's pretty

858
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,640
good does this finish oh that did finish

859
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:47,160
great um

860
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,880
okay so now we've done our feature

861
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,720
extraction the feature extraction part

862
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,880
of the lecture is done for a little bit

863
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,599
um this is a small number of

864
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,160
features but I think that they're going

865
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:01,680
to end up being halfway decent features

866
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,720
um because we thought about them a bit

867
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,319
and when the data is small you want to

868
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:08,160
think more about your features so uh you

869
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:11,079
installed something called Orange 3 but

870
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,359
it's a little bit weird uh it comes as

871
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:16,319
capital orange I just I don't know why I

872
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:18,800
don't like things Capital so I always

873
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:22,839
import orange as lowercase

874
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:26,720
orange great um we're going to load our

875
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:29,119
training data and our test data so first

876
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,200
training data

877
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,240
orange.

878
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,040
dat. you can a lot of these things are

879
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,119
they're going to be very similar in a in

880
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:42,240
a super modern um uh artificial

881
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,480
intelligence uh sort of framework like

882
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,359
uh P torch or um or tensor flow or

883
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,440
something like this similar idea you

884
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:55,000
want to load data in as a table um if

885
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,160
it's too big to load on your all at once

886
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,160
then you know there's special techniques

887
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:02,119
and stuff like that but we'll load the

888
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:05,920
training data in and now when we look at

889
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:10,720
it it just looks a little bit

890
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:12,440
nicer um actually if I do where's our

891
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:18,280
first I

892
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:20,040
know 45 to 50 does that work yeah okay

893
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,520
so that might be a little bit better

894
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:27,319
because we can see we have our um our

895
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,000
features here 2 4 12%

896
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:35,119
and three Sharps and this one happens to

897
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,920
be a jig so there um and so the

898
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,400
afterward is what the what the class is

899
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,319
great and we'll do the exact same thing

900
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,880
with the test data and we'll call it

901
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:45,480
variable test data so I'm just going to

902
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,119
copy and paste and hopefully the test

903
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,119
data looks a lot like the training

904
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,359
data oh yeah yeah it looks a lot like

905
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,200
the the training data if you don't

906
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:07,359
change the file path see how well it is

907
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,880
okay um so now we're going to create

908
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:14,119
some uh we call Learners classifiers

909
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:17,440
things that can um classify the data

910
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:19,440
here's the the first one and I think in

911
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,480
some ways the most important classifier

912
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,440
that you'll ever use and that is when

913
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,680
did I switch into camel case okay I

914
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:31,119
guess I'm in camel case now something

915
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:35,359
called called orange.

916
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,359
classification. majority

917
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:45,240
learner and um what a majority learner

918
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:48,680
is is it's kind of the control or the

919
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:51,480
placebo of your system to make sure that

920
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:54,520
you don't get too excited by how good

921
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:57,440
your system is working uh what it does

922
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:01,440
is it looks at the training data which

923
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:05,280
has 100 what maybe the training data uh

924
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:09,880
has I don't know let's say it has 51

925
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:12,960
Jigs and 49 non Jigs and it

926
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:14,839
says I will always say that any piece

927
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,400
that's ever shown to me is a jig because

928
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:20,359
then I will get over 50% right or I will

929
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:23,119
get the highest answer of doing anything

930
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:25,839
so if you are not beating your majority

931
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,920
learner you um then you're not doing any

932
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:32,200
classifications so the majority

933
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:34,400
classifier hope y'all who have taken a

934
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:38,000
machine learning class do you you get

935
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:41,520
taught this or no yeah okay good good

936
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,319
some people this will be totally um old

937
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,359
story and not so we're going to the

938
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:47,599
majority learner is just a sort of a

939
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:50,599
generic thing and now we have a

940
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:54,760
classifier which is one trained on our

941
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:57,960
data so we're going to say that this the

942
00:46:54,760 --> 00:47:00,160
majority classifier will now know how to

943
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:02,880
work with this particular

944
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,359
data um and then we'll use another one

945
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,480
called K nearest neighbors this is this

946
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:13,040
was um I don't know maybe 20 years ago

947
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,720
the state-of-the-art of of of um machine

948
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,079
learning it's a little bit out of date

949
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:20,559
now but it does work pretty well on

950
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:23,640
small data sets and few classifiers so

951
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:27,599
not not nothing that is going to get you

952
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:30,040
uh super excited at a top um Tech firm

953
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,760
but um you know it still has still has

954
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,280
its uses so we're going to do the same

955
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,480
exact same thing I just put everything

956
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,960
that I put for majority learner and then

957
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,720
put it as KN andn neighbors look at the

958
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,359
K which might be four might be three

959
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:48,480
might be five the nearest Neighbors in a

960
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:51,599
multi-dimensional vector space to your

961
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,040
one piece and try to learn where um

962
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:58,559
where in the space it

963
00:47:54,040 --> 00:48:02,640
goes snap if you're caught

964
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,480
snap if you're not now if you need a sec

965
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,440
okay

966
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:10,040
good great so I'm just going to keep

967
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,559
track of how many correct the majority

968
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:15,240
gets in a variable called M correct and

969
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:17,000
how many correct the um K nearest

970
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:21,760
neighbor gets in a variable called K

971
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:24,599
andn correct and then total equals the

972
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,520
length of the test data not the training

973
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:28,760
data so now we're going to be working on

974
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,760
this

975
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,960
and should have something like this by

976
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,480
the way um I actually I lost like half

977
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,559
an hour in in rep preparing this lecture

978
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:42,480
on like wait why do I keep getting over

979
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:45,280
100% always make sure uh to recar out

980
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,280
your number correct as you recode or

981
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,040
something or make sure to do it within

982
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,880
your Loop okay

983
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:56,359
so good so we have 106 uh things that

984
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:59,000
we're going to be able to do now now is

985
00:48:56,359 --> 00:49:03,319
for our Loop

986
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:07,440
um so we'll just do an enumeration of

987
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:11,520
each row in the test data so for I comma

988
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,520
test Row in enumerate test

989
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:19,319
data okay and then the majority learner

990
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,000
is going to take a guess for each one so

991
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:24,520
majority's guest is going to be the

992
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,000
majority classifier of the test

993
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,160
row which it's always going to guess the

994
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,680
same thing I guess in this case it's

995
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,440
always going to guess jig because

996
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:36,119
there's like four more jigs than there

997
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:38,280
are non- Jigs and then our classifier

998
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:42,799
our K nearest neighbor classifier will

999
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:44,760
also take a guess can

1000
00:49:42,799 --> 00:49:46,319
classifier I know some somebody's

1001
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,440
probably saying guess is not the right

1002
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,920
word but um you know it kind of works

1003
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:56,079
and then we'll get the

1004
00:49:49,920 --> 00:50:00,280
real is the test rows get class so as

1005
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:03,000
you said the class is either one or zero

1006
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:08,400
something like that

1007
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:11,839
and we can do print out something but um

1008
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,559
print how about this we'll just say m

1009
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:18,440
guess Cann

1010
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:22,119
guess and uh

1011
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:24,079
real so I'll I'll start this running for

1012
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:25,680
for a second but we notice we haven't

1013
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,200
put in anything on whether they got it

1014
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,720
right or not but we can just look at

1015
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:35,000
that oh one of them guesses

1016
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:38,720
um so you can see that the majority one

1017
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,200
for every single piece just puts

1018
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,359
out yep it's always a jig always a jig

1019
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,960
always a

1020
00:50:42,359 --> 00:50:45,960
jig Ker's

1021
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:51,119
neighbor says I don't think this is jig

1022
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,280
and here's the correct answer not a jig

1023
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,920
not a jig not a jig and here K nearest

1024
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,559
neighbor is learning that o this one

1025
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,920
looks like a jig

1026
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:06,680
so we'll I'll just modify this a tiny

1027
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:12,119
bit and say if majority guests equals

1028
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:17,040
real then K then majority correct add

1029
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:19,839
one if KNN guess equals

1030
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:22,799
real KNN

1031
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:23,920
correct equals one you'll probably um

1032
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:26,040
when you're trying to figure out how to

1033
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,920
do things you'll use more classifiers

1034
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,480
there's a lot more and so probably want

1035
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,559
to do this you know in some sort of a

1036
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,559
loop but

1037
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,760
great

1038
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:46,359
good so now we'll we'll see how we did

1039
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:46,359
how did majority do

1040
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:54,920
um here I'll do this

1041
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:58,520
majority M correct I always like making

1042
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,520
things look nice for humans

1043
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:12,880
why am I anal enough to start already

1044
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:15,680
putting in um some sort of a rounding

1045
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,920
thing to look because I I do feel like

1046
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,640
when you see all those significant all

1047
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:23,720
those digits it's really really hard to

1048
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,760
figure out um how important the

1049
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:27,799
difference is so the majority uh this is

1050
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,280
what I happen to know that there's 59%

1051
00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:34,000
of them are Jigs and so the majority

1052
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:36,680
learner got 59% of them right and then

1053
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,040
we'll do the same thing for

1054
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:41,880
KNN here I can I can cut and paste right

1055
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,920
we all know how to do that what are we

1056
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,839
looking

1057
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,440
up

1058
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:48,760
great

1059
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,280
um and we want to make sure that that's

1060
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,280
K&N

1061
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:57,920
correct so our classifiers get getting

1062
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,319
about

1063
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:05,559
87% correct at this just with these few

1064
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:08,920
little things now this is always EXC the

1065
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:11,319
exciting moment and then the hard part

1066
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,960
is almost always getting it from 87 to

1067
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:15,640
95 and the next harder part is getting

1068
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,920
from 95 to 97 and then going up and up

1069
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,680
and up from

1070
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:23,960
there um so that's sort of the

1071
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:28,119
theoretical part aside I'm going to um

1072
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:30,559
really quickly just um go through some

1073
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:31,760
things that music 21 has so this is you

1074
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:34,440
know

1075
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:38,000
uh uh

1076
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:39,160
um that that just make some of this a

1077
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,200
little bit

1078
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:44,119
easier um so there's I know it's already

1079
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,440
imported since I imported star but

1080
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:49,480
there's something called

1081
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:54,520
features and what we can do is set

1082
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:57,359
equals a features data set class label

1083
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:58,640
equals is jig

1084
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,760
and then we'll do the same thing with

1085
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:03,040
the test

1086
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,520
set so far it's basically the same type

1087
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:07,640
of

1088
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:10,960
thing and then I believe you have if you

1089
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:14,319
type FES you should have something there

1090
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,599
I think I put pasted this this is

1091
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:19,920
features these are built-in feature

1092
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:22,839
extractor and each one of them has an ID

1093
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:27,079
and no I don't have these memorized but

1094
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:27,079
something about um

1095
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,559
I can't remember what these are M2 you

1096
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,799
know what I'm just going to cut and

1097
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:35,799
paste because you already have this and

1098
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:40,839
put it

1099
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:44,480
here fears fears yes that my my hidden

1100
00:54:40,839 --> 00:54:46,760
uh thank you very much appreciating that

1101
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,520
and think that should

1102
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:53,920
work and so these are some features that

1103
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:55,720
have already been put in um so one of

1104
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,960
them I don't know what's the range of

1105
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:00,119
the piece how far is it from the lowest

1106
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,319
note to the highest note a lot of these

1107
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:05,640
come uh they're adapted from a really

1108
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:09,280
really cool toolkit called J symbolic

1109
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:12,599
part of jmir by uh Corey McKay uh up in

1110
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,880
Canada and um just ported them over

1111
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:16,359
because they're they're kind of neat

1112
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,200
then some of them are ones that um that

1113
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:20,040
I've written because I kind of think

1114
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,680
that they're a little valuable or

1115
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:24,000
somebody and the music 21 team has

1116
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:27,000
written so here we have a lot more

1117
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,520
features here and what we can do is we

1118
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,200
have our two data sets so we'll say the

1119
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,880
training set add feature

1120
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,839
extractors and add all those features

1121
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:40,160
extractors and then same thing for the

1122
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,160
test

1123
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,280
set and this as I said you don't need to

1124
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:48,520
be typing too much because I'm just

1125
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:51,520
going to go pretty fast and what we'll

1126
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:54,319
do is um I'm just going

1127
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:58,079
to cut and paste this because all we're

1128
00:55:54,319 --> 00:56:00,559
doing is dividing things up into either

1129
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,640
the test or the training set depending

1130
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:05,359
on if it's even or odd and so we'll just

1131
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:08,240
add the data on

1132
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:09,640
here with some nice little features that

1133
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,520
and this will just generate all the

1134
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:15,799
headers for you oops what did I

1135
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:17,720
do testing set is what I called it

1136
00:56:15,799 --> 00:56:19,400
before sorry training and testing that

1137
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:23,119
makes

1138
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:26,400
sense no did I do something wrong oh I

1139
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:28,720
have to change it up here there we go

1140
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,480
starting all over hopefully I don't have

1141
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:33,920
any numb cracks great and that's just

1142
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,520
doing all the um feature extraction kind

1143
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,200
of getting them in that's going to take

1144
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,880
a little bit of time so we're going to

1145
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:43,280
switch like they do in the cooking shows

1146
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,480
to the already baked version where it's

1147
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,960
all

1148
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:50,760
done okay um

1149
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:54,079
oops here we

1150
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:57,920
go where do we where' we

1151
00:56:54,079 --> 00:57:00,480
go is it yep so the next couple things

1152
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:03,000
that you do you want to process all your

1153
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,400
dating set training set and write it out

1154
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,079
just like before process it and write it

1155
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:10,160
out why is it taking so much longer

1156
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,240
because we gave it a whole bunch of

1157
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,680
features and some of them take a long

1158
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:18,760
time to do like ones that have to do

1159
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:20,839
with um variability between parts and um

1160
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,720
parallel fifths finding if it's a

1161
00:57:20,839 --> 00:57:26,359
multi-part thing and so

1162
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:28,480
on but then the next row ends up being

1163
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,839
the exact same type of thing we have a

1164
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,960
majority learner we're going to still

1165
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:36,720
use the KNN learner and um then try to

1166
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:40,000
see how well it did

1167
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:42,559
and we keep looking and again the

1168
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,400
majority learner is still 59% you hope

1169
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:48,079
that that doesn't change and now using

1170
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:53,160
all of these extra features we've gotten

1171
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:57,400
our number from 87% all the way up to

1172
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:59,960
61% so um sometimes just throwing more

1173
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:03,240
feature extractors at the problem is

1174
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:07,240
just going to have you wait longer at

1175
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:09,359
the computer um sometimes sometimes

1176
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,760
thinking really carefully about what you

1177
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:14,280
already think the data might look like

1178
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,559
is a pretty good thing and especially if

1179
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:18,359
you're working with a small data set

1180
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,000
where it's not going to be able to do

1181
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:23,520
the kinds of deep um neural network

1182
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,160
learning have to keep going through

1183
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:30,119
enough to really build a model of the

1184
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:33,160
the set as um some people say you know

1185
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:35,160
that uh look the computers the neural

1186
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:38,119
networks are getting getting better and

1187
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:41,559
better and um we just need to throw more

1188
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:44,200
data at it but imagine if you wanted to

1189
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:47,200
have a program that was uh automatically

1190
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:50,559
you know reading handwriting and you

1191
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,359
gave the program um all these papers of

1192
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:55,319
handwriting and you just gave them an

1193
00:58:52,359 --> 00:58:57,039
audio file of how it drops how it sounds

1194
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:59,200
when it drops and try to do it you're

1195
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:02,640
giving it kind of the wrong data to

1196
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,559
learn on and so a lot of the extractors

1197
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,520
now unless you're giv writing your own

1198
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:09,280
unless you're using really musically

1199
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:11,640
sensitive ones you're you can save the

1200
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,839
computer a lot of time by trying to

1201
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:16,520
trying to already say you know hey let's

1202
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:19,520
process this as a symbols ahead of time

1203
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:22,480
or something like that um a lot of the

1204
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:26,119
by the way state-ofthe-art of symbolic

1205
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:28,200
um music machine learning things are uh

1206
00:59:26,119 --> 00:59:31,799
you all remember the piano

1207
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:34,240
rooll you know where we put things like

1208
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:36,839
this to show length and stuff like that

1209
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:40,960
yeah well it's converting the entire

1210
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:44,280
musical score to a piano roll saving

1211
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:47,480
that as an image and then using image

1212
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:49,799
classifiers and image uh generators to

1213
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:52,079
generate pieces that look like the piano

1214
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:55,039
rolls and then translating them back so

1215
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:57,359
I think I'm hoping that over the next

1216
00:59:55,039 --> 01:00:00,880
decade or so we we can do better and do

1217
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:03,640
some things that uh help help these

1218
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:06,359
neural Nets and classifiers uh work with

1219
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:07,720
data that's a little bit closer to uh

1220
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:12,960
the original

1221
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:16,520
numbers okay um I have time for just a

1222
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:21,799
little little fun thing with my favorite

1223
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:25,079
uh low um feature uh extraction thing so

1224
01:00:21,799 --> 01:00:26,640
let me just show a couple little things

1225
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:28,920
okay um

1226
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:31,280
yeah the importance of first off the

1227
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:34,400
importance of thinking about data sets

1228
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,559
and ground truths um this is you know I

1229
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,400
think one of the first pieces that

1230
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:42,319
showed uh deep learning the the kind of

1231
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:45,079
uh for people in the no moment uh like

1232
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:46,480
chat GPT has been in the last year uh

1233
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:49,559
happened I think it was about 10 years

1234
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:51,599
ago when um Alpha zero and Alpha go

1235
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:55,280
suddenly became the world's greatest go

1236
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,720
and chess players um and so a lot of

1237
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,960
people think you this was with

1238
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:02,599
generalized knowledge no rules being

1239
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:05,880
taught except for legal move or not um

1240
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:08,920
but one of the things to think about um

1241
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:10,200
the difference between a lot of the the

1242
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:13,000
things that they were being trained on

1243
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:14,839
and what you have is that Alpha zero the

1244
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,480
chess plane computer you know played

1245
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:20,400
what was it 700,000 games or million

1246
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:23,520
games or something like that and at the

1247
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:27,000
end of every single game it played it

1248
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:29,319
got perfect feedback on how how it did

1249
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,319
you won you lost you tied you won you

1250
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:33,160
lost you tied a lot of the things that

1251
01:01:31,319 --> 01:01:36,160
we're interested in doing with music

1252
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,599
like music recommendation or you know uh

1253
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,720
things like this you predicting what's

1254
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:43,039
the next great hit first off we can't we

1255
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,400
don't have that correct data Maybe you

1256
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:46,520
know what's the Billboard Chart or

1257
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,680
something like that but for how good was

1258
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:50,119
this piece because it's going to be

1259
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,880
different every time it's going to take

1260
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:55,039
us 3 minutes to listen to if it's

1261
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,559
computer generating song and then we're

1262
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,240
going to give it feedack back that we

1263
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,119
might feel differently about that piece

1264
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:02,680
tomorrow so we don't give perfect

1265
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:05,200
feedback and it takes a long time so

1266
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:07,839
this is why one of the reasons I like um

1267
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:11,119
working with uh some of the older things

1268
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:13,000
okay we'll go back great um I don't

1269
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,960
think I've I presented this no I

1270
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,079
presented another place so this is what

1271
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,599
we'll end for the last 10 minutes and

1272
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:23,079
talking about um some of the interesting

1273
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:26,000
things that come out with features um so

1274
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:27,400
how would you distinguish Coral music

1275
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,799
from Bach from

1276
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:33,279
monver so just we we're doing a lot of

1277
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:37,319
Bach in this class but we'll get a

1278
01:02:33,279 --> 01:02:37,319
little bit more into ear here is sign

1279
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:50,640
Bach so this is

1280
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:53,079
[Music]

1281
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:55,240
Bach and so then we'll switch to one of

1282
01:02:53,079 --> 01:03:00,039
the other other great composers about

1283
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:01,880
100 and 100 years before Bach claudo Mon

1284
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:05,760
and so some of you this might be the

1285
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,760
first time you'll hear him

1286
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,160
one second to the bo again so we can get

1287
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:38,760
back

1288
01:03:35,559 --> 01:03:41,960
great what's something you you heard

1289
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:41,960
different between the two of

1290
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:48,240
them Som with more of minor Keys okay

1291
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,119
somber more minor Keys we can do a key

1292
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,119
detection

1293
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,039
Jonathan I mean b had sounded like there

1294
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,839
were like more people see but it's hard

1295
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:04,319
uhuh yeah but it could be it could be

1296
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:10,359
more people Fuller than good

1297
01:04:04,319 --> 01:04:14,119
yeah is more together where like lot

1298
01:04:10,359 --> 01:04:16,279
of do BU more together homophonic maybe

1299
01:04:14,119 --> 01:04:20,559
mon Verity doing their own thing good

1300
01:04:16,279 --> 01:04:20,559
one last one else

1301
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:26,200
want okay that's a pretty good place to

1302
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:29,720
start so

1303
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:32,760
I threw um everything in all the kitchen

1304
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:36,559
sink of classifier of feature extractors

1305
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:41,520
and got to see what a particular um

1306
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:43,440
algorithm did that um that uh that

1307
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:46,440
seemed to work pretty pretty well and

1308
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,119
the first um here's a little quiz it's

1309
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,240
one of the few quizzes that uh

1310
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:53,000
Elementary School students do better

1311
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:57,240
than adults at so let's see if we can

1312
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:00,200
figure this out 7802 is three

1313
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:05,160
1065 is two okay if you've seen it

1314
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:10,160
before then don't answer it 998 is

1315
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:10,160
four and one 1773 is

1316
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,200
zero if you're new to

1317
01:05:19,279 --> 01:05:30,200
this one two three three circles

1318
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:33,119
one Circle two circles one two 3 four

1319
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:35,039
circles and no circles so I put that up

1320
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:37,640
to say that some days the computer is

1321
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:40,680
going to be looking at things that are

1322
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,720
really really far um out um in trying to

1323
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:44,880
figure out things so there's all these

1324
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:47,079
things that we could be looking at um

1325
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:49,440
I'll bet that the proportion of

1326
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:51,440
instruments that are electronic um isn't

1327
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,680
going to help with Bach versus Mon

1328
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,240
Verity but one of the things I like

1329
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:58,359
about a particular uh class Pacifier

1330
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,359
that is not close to the

1331
01:05:58,359 --> 01:06:02,640
state-of-the-art it is not or to the

1332
01:06:00,359 --> 01:06:06,160
getting the best results but this uh

1333
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:09,160
tree learner can ex unlike being a black

1334
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:10,960
box it can actually show what the path

1335
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:14,240
so it's of a decision tree branching

1336
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:19,400
tree uh it took to get there so here's

1337
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:23,319
how it can say to begin if the note F

1338
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:27,119
below Middle Sea is used more than 14%

1339
01:06:23,319 --> 01:06:29,359
of the time the pieces by Bach

1340
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:32,839
otherwise if the top number in the time

1341
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:34,839
signature is three or less It Is by

1342
01:06:32,839 --> 01:06:36,720
Bach

1343
01:06:34,839 --> 01:06:38,119
otherwise I love this one if the

1344
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,079
distance between the highest note in the

1345
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:43,039
soprano and the lowest note of the base

1346
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,720
is less than two octaves and a minor 6th

1347
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:46,400
then it's by boach and then there's

1348
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,359
three more things we get to the final

1349
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,520
one uh count the number of times each

1350
01:06:48,359 --> 01:06:51,880
note is used find the note that used the

1351
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,640
most often and the note they used the

1352
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:56,200
second most often if the second most

1353
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:58,240
often used note is used less than 90 7%

1354
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,680
as often as the most commonly used note

1355
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:02,640
the piece is by

1356
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:06,400
Bach otherwise it's by Mon and this

1357
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,400
worked with 99%

1358
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:13,400
accuracy what I loved about this is I

1359
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,400
that this was the first decision to

1360
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:19,760
distinguish and I was just baffled by it

1361
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:22,960
until I realized well okay Bach has more

1362
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:25,039
pieces in uh sharp Keys than Mont ver is

1363
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,799
so okay that would make sense Mont ver

1364
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:30,319
was most ly hovering around um you know

1365
01:07:27,799 --> 01:07:32,440
no sharps or flats or one flat assign

1366
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:34,359
but then you know it's minor and there's

1367
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:37,799
raised leaning tones and stuff like that

1368
01:07:34,359 --> 01:07:40,039
so why not well um the leading tone

1369
01:07:37,799 --> 01:07:41,640
tends to get raised in the melody which

1370
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:46,160
tends to be in a higher

1371
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:48,079
voice the middle area tenor will only

1372
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:50,520
appear as FP if the key signature is

1373
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:53,400
already F so it's a way of learning some

1374
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:56,799
things like this and um this particular

1375
01:07:53,400 --> 01:08:00,240
one ended up being garbage in Gage out

1376
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:02,720
that monity uh doesn't using modern time

1377
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:06,799
signatures and so when we the people who

1378
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:09,839
encoded this chose never to use two4

1379
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:11,680
always put it into 44 two bar because

1380
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:13,599
because there also weren't bar lines so

1381
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:17,159
you could decide how long so this ended

1382
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:19,159
up being that the computer learned not

1383
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:21,440
the difference between Bach and monver

1384
01:08:19,159 --> 01:08:24,799
but the difference between box editor

1385
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:27,480
modern editor and Mon's modern editor I

1386
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:31,400
have lost the reference but I've been

1387
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:33,359
told about an audio um an audio

1388
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:36,560
classifier that tried to classify VI

1389
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:38,600
genre and it was doing very very well

1390
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:41,600
until it turns out that different genres

1391
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:44,040
of music use different microphones on in

1392
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,880
general and it was picking up the

1393
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:48,520
difference between the microphone so if

1394
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:52,239
you sing country music on a hip-hop

1395
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:54,679
microphone it would classify as hip hop

1396
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:58,319
so all these things we need to be really

1397
01:08:54,679 --> 01:09:00,520
careful about um what's going on with

1398
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:04,239
potential for classification and so this

1399
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:06,319
is where I kind of like this old school

1400
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:07,839
um imagine this is s of a tree diagram

1401
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:09,520
of things going left and right I guess

1402
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:12,960
if you turn it sideways these kind of

1403
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:15,400
old school feature um classifiers a

1404
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:18,400
little bit just to check what's what

1405
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:20,319
might be happening in the latest

1406
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:24,520
blackbox

1407
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:27,440
so you guys did a remarkable stamina you

1408
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:30,679
got through the zombie of of music

1409
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:34,199
eating feature extraction and um I hope

1410
01:09:30,679 --> 01:09:37,199
that some people will choose to um find

1411
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:39,880
if you find this to be helpful in doing

1412
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:42,279
something in your final project you now

1413
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:44,640
have some of the tools to do it on uh

1414
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:47,560
Friday we'll continue with searching and

1415
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,719
similarity and we will be giving um the

1416
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:51,920
first 15 minutes explaining what he's

1417
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:54,679
doing at MIT he's a professor of

1418
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:58,640
computer science and um what he's been

1419
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:59,679
doing with music on his uh work so um

1420
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,840
that'll be a start and then I'll

1421
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:04,840
continue with some other things great

1422
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:04,840
thanks
