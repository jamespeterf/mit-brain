1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,000
So I'm Steve Whitaker, one of the

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,400
program directors at the industrial

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,720
lesson program, but prior to joining uh

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,039
MIT, I was with BT for about 40 years,

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,320
most of that working with MIT. So it's

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,640
fantastic to be back uh at one Brham. Um

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,080
and just want to say it's also fantastic

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,439
back in London because we've just spent

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,760
the week here meeting with various

10
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,960
companies and um it was really nice

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,320
during the weeks this full moon and

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,120
those sort of thing but really reminded

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,360
what a kind of fantastic city is uh what

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,239
a you a vibrant kind of global

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,600
crossroads it is uh representative of a

16
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,600
kind of a UK that again is a a vibrant

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,320
global crossroads with a kind of you

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,960
know hopefully a vital role in uh both

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,120
glo in global affairs and global trade.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,760
Um this was just as out walking down the

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,879
um down the bank last couple of evenings

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,239
ago. Um I just wanted to give a bit of

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,520
bit of framing for the afternoon and

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,920
talk a little bit about why why the

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,320
events kind of structured the way it is.

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,320
Um and to ground some of the things in

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,439
where we are and you know discuss later

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,960
on where we're going. So um as my

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,400
colleagues know I'm a I'm a technologist

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,960
not a historian but we're one of those

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,240
points in time where technology seems to

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,680
be driving history. uh and in some ways

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,200
with things like social media and

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,960
disinformation history has become a

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,759
technology. So those two have become

36
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,119
kind of very very blurred together. One

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,479
of the things that struck me was walking

38
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,479
as you walk through the city you have

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,799
this these juxositions of the kind of

40
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,400
the uh the on the almost like the

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,840
ancient and the modern. So we were

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,600
walking down the the embankment and we

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,320
went to visit GSMA which is the trade

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
body for the mobile industry and you're

45
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,040
looking across the river and you see the

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,880
Golden Hind. You think, well, that's

47
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,240
this, you know, why the Golden Hind?

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,240
Well, the Golden Hind was the ship that

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,040
did the first circumnavigation of the

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,720
globe and really laid the foundations

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,399
for what then became the first wave of

52
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,280
globalization, globalization kind of

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,920
1.0. And from that laid the, you know,

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,840
the age of empires, the age of uh global

55
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,960
trade, those sorts of things. Um, and

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,320
you talk about the, you know, with the

57
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,520
mobile industry being very much the

58
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,160
infrastructure for almost that

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,200
globalization 3, you know, 3.0, So you

60
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,360
know as we start to kind of you know um

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
you know previously under you less

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,640
engaged parts of the global economy

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,800
become more engaged with this digital

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,760
digital infrastructure. So you really

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,360
see this kind of role of of London as as

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,319
part of that connective tissue in kind

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,480
of global change and global

68
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,000
connectivity. Um I put this up because

69
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,480
these are just ones we you know popping

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,239
round. Um, and if it was a quiz show,

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,319
you go, "Okay, which one is these is the

72
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,680
odd one out?" And you go, you know,

73
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,280
well, obviously odd one out is St.

74
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,200
Paul's, but the the reason it's

75
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,720
different and slightly different is that

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,160
I hadn't realized, but these and these

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,440
are just two local churches just around

78
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,000
the corner. They're both St. Bs. So, one

79
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,959
of them is St. B without Oldgate. So,

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,680
the other one is St. Both without

81
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,920
uh Bishop's Gate. And these are churches

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,400
that are on the Roman wall and they were

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,120
outside the Roman wall. And turns out S

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,120
Both is an East Anglian saint who is the

85
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,560
patron saint of boundaries. Is a bit of

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,720
a strange thing to be a patron saint. So

87
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,879
it's like patron of corners and stuff

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,800
like that. Um but that also means he's

89
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,000
like the the patron trains of travel and

90
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,400
trade. And so there are actually four uh

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,239
some bottes within easy walking distance

92
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,599
to these two. There's one that's

93
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,959
actually close to St. Paul's I believe

94
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,440
and there's one at Billingsgate which

95
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,200
was burnt by during the great fire not

96
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,560
rebuilt. But it was just kind of

97
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,480
interesting and it says something also

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,680
to the fact that yeah we're right by the

99
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,319
London wall. Oldgate was where the Roman

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,879
road to Colchester went out. Uh

101
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,239
Colchester was the uh the Roman capital

102
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,879
of Britain. Um this area then became the

103
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,879
kind of the um you know the point of

104
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,239
entry of all the trade from the east of

105
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,000
England coming into London. So you

106
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,640
imagine droing routes bringing cattle

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,280
into London uh all around this kind of

108
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,159
area. uh and it became very much an area

109
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,560
where communities you know fleeing

110
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,519
religious persecution fleeing other wars

111
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,760
would settle. So in the 1600s it was the

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,959
huge uh escaping some of the conflicts

113
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,799
in Europe um which made this a center of

114
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,959
kind of textiles and clothing which led

115
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,440
to petticoat market uh which is

116
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,959
obviously just up the road. um in the

117
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,120
1890s

118
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,440
uh early 1900s it was the Jewish

119
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,720
population from Russia and the Baltics

120
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,840
escaping the pograms um and those waves

121
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,840
have come through and you go through now

122
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,080
we went there's been a Caribbean wave

123
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,440
you go through some sort of south south

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,520
Asian um just a very very vibrant

125
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,479
community that's really connected with

126
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,360
the world um and always has been now

127
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:47,280
sometimes that brings tensions with it

128
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,400
um so um in the early 1900s you had a

129
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,759
with some of these waves this sort of

130
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,120
wave of radical politics that were

131
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,280
sweeping through Europe in the age of

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,000
revolutions. So you had the siege of

133
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,080
Sydney Street uh with kind of radicals

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
you know running robberies to fund

135
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,880
various things and then you Winston

136
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,280
Churchill outside the store for all

137
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,520
those famous photographs. Uh round the

138
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,080
corner uh in fact literally round the

139
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,759
corner uh on White Chapel High Street

140
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,240
was the scene of the Battle of Cable

141
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,720
Street uh which was a running street

142
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,880
battle between several thousand uh

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,919
mostly black shirts in their 30s and

144
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,560
about a 100,000 East Enders and

145
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,160
effectively that was the end of the uh

146
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,759
you know British fascist movement in the

147
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,440
30s. it was the banning of political

148
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:32,080
uniforms um crystallized the UK's

149
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,680
position ahead of the second world war

150
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,680
all these sorts of things so it's a very

151
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,800
different history than you get over with

152
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,000
that um Tower of London Buckingham

153
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,560
Palace which is the kind of the history

154
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,720
of great people this place is deep in

155
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,039
the history of kind of ordinary people

156
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,560
orary communities from around the world

157
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,000
coming and that really fits into a lot

158
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,880
of what we're uh what we're talking

159
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,800
about so this is kind of the view from

160
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,759
Wentworth Street which which is just up

161
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,400
the road. And you really get this

162
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,240
juiposition of the kind of the you know

163
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,400
the old and the new and in some sense of

164
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,919
the new being potentially depending from

165
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,560
your perspective you know like some of

166
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,240
us live in this end and some of us feel

167
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,800
like we're in the shadow of this new

168
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,680
that's that's changing so uh you can see

169
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,919
some of these things so about so this is

170
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,759
the sec so this is the this is the fifth

171
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,759
conference that we've run MIT and BT

172
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,600
have run together this is really the

173
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,000
second in a series and I think the last

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,400
one we ran two years ago was really

175
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,240
about this question about how do we when

176
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,520
we're building these new technologies,

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,759
new platforms that are going to affect

178
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,520
everybody. It became particularly clear

179
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,680
after things like the Snowden papers

180
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,919
that when we build a technology, we're

181
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,520
also embedding some values into how we

182
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,960
design the technology, how we govern it

183
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,479
and those sorts of things. So the

184
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,880
conference we ran two years ago was

185
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,560
about this idea of value. So how do

186
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,720
technology create value? How's that

187
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,560
value get spread? values, how do we

188
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,720
bring our uh shared objectives, shared

189
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,800
norms and shared kind of constraints

190
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,479
into those platforms and then platforms

191
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,840
for the future where we were going. So

192
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,280
this was very much a sense in which we

193
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,800
were beginning to the early ones we

194
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,280
started off with kind of blind optimism

195
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,880
about about innovation. Then it became a

196
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,080
bit more modulated by some of the things

197
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,720
that were happening in terms of things

198
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,240
like snow and those sorts of things. um

199
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,639
going forward I think we we've now found

200
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,800
ourselves two years over two years on in

201
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,039
a you know a different global context

202
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,720
and that's really part of what we're

203
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,240
here today and just to kind of give a

204
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,240
little kind of you know some thoughts on

205
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,240
that global context um the at the end of

206
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,520
the second world war there was this

207
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,520
point at which we moved from this kind

208
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,120
of globalization 1.0 that we mentioned

209
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,919
which was really a world that was

210
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,400
anchored in in empire and the end of

211
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,319
empire. Um we moved to the end of the

212
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,560
second world war effectly you know

213
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,680
modulo not being a historian there was a

214
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,440
sense we need a different way of

215
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,520
organizing things and we went for the

216
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,199
things that effectively helped the uh

217
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,599
the allies to win the second world war.

218
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,599
So focused on technology a sense that

219
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,360
open markets were a way of spreading

220
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,840
wealth and getting diversity in and

221
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,720
globalization and then also talking

222
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,160
democratic processes. We kicked that off

223
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,919
and that's been moving forward and

224
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,039
that's been our philosophical view of

225
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,240
where global integration plays out. In

226
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,080
parallel, we kicked off the digital

227
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,000
revolution very much started with

228
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,160
co-breaking during the second world war.

229
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,360
As those two went forward, they turned

230
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,039
into be extremely mutually um kind of

231
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,440
reinforcing. So um as we began to wire

232
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,879
the world, it made globalization easier.

233
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,759
You couldn't imagine global supply

234
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,240
chains without the internet. Um doing

235
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,840
that brought you know new skill bases in

236
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,000
from around the world. You you brought

237
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,919
things like China came online. Hundreds

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,560
of million people move from rural

239
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,719
poverty to the middle classes becoming

240
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,959
engaged in the IT you know Huawei etc.

241
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,399
So these have kind of gone together and

242
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,160
they've really raised hundreds of

243
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,640
millions of people's quality of living

244
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,720
but they've also built tensions into the

245
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,200
system and those tensions have been both

246
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,320
domestic and they've been international.

247
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,240
And I think it's one of the reasons why

248
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,760
we're beginning to see this kind of

249
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,160
fragmentation

250
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,200
of the global system and we got used to

251
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,080
the idea at the end of the second world

252
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,440
war we were going to do science

253
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,040
together. For example, the way to move

254
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
forward was that everybody do science

255
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,720
together and then we compete on the

256
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,440
applications and the economies. That

257
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,839
assumption is now being pulled apart by

258
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,839
things like the unwind between the US uh

259
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,440
Europe and China. So all those

260
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,279
expectations we had about this

261
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,920
trajectory we're on towards greater

262
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,360
globalization and the ways in which kind

263
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,440
of wealth and prosperity was spread

264
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,200
through that are coming under some kind

265
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,680
of threat. So now there's a lot more

266
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,920
talk about sovereign capacity. How do we

267
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,760
make sure that uh every nation has

268
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,640
access to the minerals and strategic

269
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,920
materials it needs? How does the US make

270
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,519
ensure that if it's going to succeed in

271
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,000
AI, it has access to computing

272
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,959
resources, the silicon foundaries, hence

273
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,519
$50 billion investment in the chips end

274
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,240
of the chips and science act. Um very

275
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,040
very different context. So the the idea

276
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,959
today was really to kind of explore some

277
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,839
of the ways we think about innovation,

278
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,120
some of the ways we think about

279
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,399
technology, some of the ways we think

280
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,360
about ecosystems, and some of the ways

281
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,959
we think about people in this more

282
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,880
contested

283
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,120
um slightly more volatile perhaps

284
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,560
fragile kind of um kind of global

285
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,920
system. So we're going to do two things

286
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,279
this afternoon. So one of them is we're

287
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,440
going to look at one of the the the kind

288
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,200
of you know one of the big drivers of

289
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,880
the change that's you know could

290
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,440
potentially really accelerate this

291
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,959
process. you know, AI has the potential

292
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,399
to really create winners and losers

293
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,720
unless we think about it in ways that

294
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,440
kind of raise the overall economy, raise

295
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,480
everybody up. Um, and then after that,

296
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,200
we're going to look at, you know, how

297
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,279
this plays out in both in toughte and

298
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,480
deep tech. How do we, you know, do some

299
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,760
of these hard things that, you know,

300
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,040
someone Mash had talked about earlier

301
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,920
on. How do we develop things like um,

302
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,920
uh, fusion reactors at a point in time

303
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,279
when global collaboration is perhaps,

304
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,200
you know, lower than it should be? And

305
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,320
then we'll match that with Alex from

306
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,240
Chattam House who will look at the

307
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,760
digital side of that as well. So

308
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,399
hopefully this afternoon will be kind of

309
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,079
a a kind of journey through some of

310
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,600
those kind of kind of discussions, some

311
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,200
of those questions. But I wanted to

312
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
start on the kind of promise side of
