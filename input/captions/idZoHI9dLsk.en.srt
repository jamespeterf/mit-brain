2
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,720
tonight I want to try to pose the basic

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,240
assumption behind the idea of

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,519
facilitative leadership in the public

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,960
sector and share a few terms a few

6
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:35,440
Concepts I want to give you a problem to

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:39,120
think about at dinner then ask you at

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,840
your table to pursue the questions and

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,320
then save about 10 minutes at the end to

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,440
see if something different was happening

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:52,399
at the different tables but the key idea

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:56,239
tonight is raise this question and offer

13
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,199
some terms some Concepts the goal is to

14
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,000
begin a conversation if I had these

15
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,680
ideas all worked out for myself I would

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,680
have written a book but I definitely

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,320
don't have all these ideas worked out so

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,759
my goal is to share some thoughts

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,360
provoke some

20
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:20,119
conversation ask you to continue the

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,320
conversation in small groups and then

22
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:27,040
all together and I'm hoping that I can

23
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,280
get you to write a couple Pages at the

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,920
end of the fourth week or sooner should

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,119
you be mo motivated and that I can take

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,240
all of those and work them into the kind

27
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,799
of uh summary or synthesis I will draft

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,960
something and then encourage anybody

29
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:47,600
that contributed to continue to work to

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,200
take that draft develop it further and

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,040
have it be a departmental publication

32
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,119
which we don't have but I don't see why

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,360
we can't do that because I think the

34
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:02,840
question will continue um to be of

35
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:08,119
interest and concern so all

36
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:10,879
started last spring at the end of uh the

37
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,879
semester my course on negotiation and

38
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,879
dispute resolution in the public sector

39
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:19,560
uh said you know I've looked around for

40
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,239
leadership courses they have them at the

41
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,959
Kennedy School they have them at the

42
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,840
business school at Harvard they have

43
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,720
them at

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,319
Sloan but they all seem to assume you're

45
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,720
somebody working in a private

46
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:36,800
organization it's not the same thing as

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:38,400
leadership in the public context really

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,120
the assumption is you're in an

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,120
organization and it's a private

50
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:50,959
organization how do you manage as a

51
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:54,080
leader there's nothing said differently

52
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,720
about being in a leadership role in the

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,040
public sector and I think it's very

54
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,720
different that's the what I'm trying to

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,280
work out in what ways is it different

56
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,319
should all the basic assumptions be

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,280
questioned about leadership SL

58
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,360
management of groups organizations

59
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,560
networks um in the public sector I've

60
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,760
spent 50 years working in dispute

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,640
resolution in the public sector in 30

62
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,360
countries um I want to think

63
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,280
comparatively about this so please do

64
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,959
not constrain yourself unnecessarily to

65
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,360
imagine only something in a US context

66
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,400
when we're talking um at table

67
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,080
conversation if you're thinking very

68
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,799
much in your culture your context your

69
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,400
country just say so don't not do it but

70
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,120
let everybody else know that you're

71
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,480
starting from a different point in the

72
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,200
conversation and I don't know about how

73
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,879
far generalizations can go about the

74
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,120
public sector when we switch from

75
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:03,159
country and culture to Country culture

76
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,159
we'll see what you think about

77
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:12,200
that imagine a city government has

78
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,400
appointed a task force to give the city

79
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,680
advice regarding the decision the city

80
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,919
has to make regarding the use of a

81
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:26,520
particular piece of public land that was

82
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,800
abandoned not used and now there are

83
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,680
multiple proposals for how it should be

84
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,280
used within that neighborhood within the

85
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:39,080
city within the metropolitan area and

86
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,120
the cities asked a task force of people

87
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,000
the uh the usual the Blue Ribbon

88
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,600
committee was announced and a lot of

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,560
folks yelled about that and so more

90
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:55,160
people got added that was the solution

91
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,440
to representation that that mayor chose

92
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,639
okay fine we'll just add more people

93
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,120
especially the ones who've made noise

94
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,479
you be on the

95
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,320
committee begging the

96
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,320
question of the representativeness and

97
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,840
thus The

98
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,360
credibility of this group and whatever

99
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,520
it

100
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,960
recommends but since the city wasn't

101
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,560
giving away final decision-making

102
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,600
Authority was just asking for advice

103
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,600
from a task force didn't worry too much

104
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
about

105
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,120
representativeness it didn't worry too

106
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,199
much about

107
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,560
credibility in the eyes of the groups

108
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,520
that weren't at the

109
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,440
table and so this task

110
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,400
force has been

111
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,520
meeting it didn't have much of a mandate

112
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,680
just we like your advice about this

113
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,280
undeveloped parcel that's been sitting

114
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,120
here for a long time what do you think

115
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,639
City should do with it and my question

116
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,039
to you

117
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,080
is how would you know who's the real

118
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,280
leader of that task force they've met

119
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,800
multiple

120
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,639
times they have whatever mandate they

121
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:16,720
had from the mayor's office how would we

122
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:21,120
know who's the real leader of this 25

123
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:24,120
person group you could clearly tell that

124
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,919
a couple of people had way more

125
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,199
knowledge and experience with regard to

126
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:32,400
the city city politics City Planning

127
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,080
City development real estate development

128
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,199
and they were showing it off in the

129
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:41,360
conversation did that make them the

130
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,560
leader or maybe we're listening and one

131
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,080
person soft

132
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:50,880
voice not pushing hard at all on the

133
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,560
substantive question but says well I've

134
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,560
been on a bunch of task forces like this

135
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,560
before in the city and my sense is we

136
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,960
ought to do this this and this and use

137
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,039
our time this way way and get the

138
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,720
involvement of other people like so and

139
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:10,000
so and so and so with the fact that that

140
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,800
person had the most experience in this

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,120
kind of a role would that qualify them

142
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,000
to be the leader would that make them

143
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,039
the

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,120
leader is one person who clearly is the

145
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,080
Workhorse on this committee they're

146
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,919
saying oh I'll take the notes I'll work

147
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,960
the flip chart and they're making very

148
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:30,759
clear that they're taking care of all

149
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,039
the

150
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:37,080
housekeeping chores and activities

151
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:40,280
almost like a secretary keeping track of

152
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,479
the ideas and offering their own views

153
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,240
along the

154
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:47,840
way is the person willing to do the most

155
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,319
work the leader who's the

156
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,240
leader or are there just these

157
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,680
leadership

158
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,840
functions and different people can all

159
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,440
choose on their own to play different

160
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,240
functions as long as the rest of the

161
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,120
group accepts it if we're in a corporate

162
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,080
context I promise you everyone would

163
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,000
know who the leader of the group is

164
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,319
because whoever said there would be a

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
meeting whoever said there would be a

166
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,400
group

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,319
appointed the person who was the head of

168
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,039
the group

169
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,639
right doesn't happen that way most of

170
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,039
the time I'm talking about when the

171
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,120
larger

172
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,159
network of

173
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,360
the

174
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:37,599
public is

175
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:41,719
tapped and trying to organize in cities

176
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,279
trying to organize them don't we need a

177
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,320
theory of

178
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,519
practice as urban

179
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,959
planners with regard to how this

180
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:52,959
leadership question should be handled in

181
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,560
the public

182
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:59,920
Arena just whatever happens mayor says

183
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,600
it's fine with me it's a whole group can

184
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,040
just collect their suggestions and send

185
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,600
them to me that's

186
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:13,800
fine as practitioners I think we need a

187
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:19,120
theory of practice could be our own it

188
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:21,399
could be the MIT theory of leadership

189
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,720
facilitative leadership could be you

190
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:27,240
know your tables Theory but I don't see

191
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,839
how as planners we just wander

192
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:37,519
forward and we're going to be in so many

193
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:42,160
situations in which OD hoc clusters of

194
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:45,519
people are supposed to be doing the

195
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,959
Public's work we're usually supposed to

196
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:53,240
be involved in such things and I think

197
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:56,000
the key to that is to see yourself as a

198
00:09:53,240 --> 00:10:00,760
facilitative leader providing a

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,120
service a service it's a service model

200
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,079
of leadership which I think is necessary

201
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,959
in the public sector but you can

202
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,480
convince me that that's wrong you have

203
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,560
plenty of alternative models and that's

204
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,720
why we're going to be having

205
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:18,120
conversations about this they need to be

206
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,200
empathetic to the interests of the other

207
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,720
people in the around the

208
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,279
table if you can't Jin up empathy for

209
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,959
the others and their quandaries with

210
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,959
regard to this you'll never be a leader

211
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,760
of that

212
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:36,600
group you have to be a capable active

213
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,000
listener if you can't hear how far off

214
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,880
you are about what's going on by

215
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,320
listening to people talking to each

216
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:48,959
other or to you you won't

217
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:52,480
succeed you have to be able to read the

218
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,079
group to recognize underlying

219
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,880
dynamics that let you know more about

220
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:59,000
the interests of the

221
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,480
participants this is not people raising

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,399
their hand and saying something reading

223
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,160
the group over many occasions Coalition

224
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:13,000
building you can't keep treating it like

225
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:16,560
a set of individuals who are only there

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,639
for themselves you have to help them

227
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,200
begin to form

228
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,320
coalitions you cannot function in a

229
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,839
service role if you cannot put aside

230
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:29,360
your ego you need to be able to take a

231
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,560
Long View the group needs you to do that

232
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,720
they're focused on the short term I

233
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:38,079
would argue the facilitative leader has

234
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:42,200
to constantly be thinking about the long

235
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:45,399
term you have to be able to write the

236
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:48,480
group's victory speech you have to be

237
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,560
able to draft that as the facilitative

238
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,440
leader because it has to take count of

239
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,720
how it looks from all of their

240
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,680
standpoints you have to promote

241
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,839
organizational learning along the way

242
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,880
what didn't we do well what did we do

243
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,639
well how would was that just this one

244
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,320
time or is there something there we can

245
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:14,279
change about how we're working so we do

246
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,920
better next time but if someone is not

247
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,920
focused on organizational learning it

248
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,120
will not just fall out

249
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,680
naturally now when I look at that list

250
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,360
of let's call them skills not micro

251
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:31,399
skills but capabilities capacities leads

252
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,920
me to the conclusion may lead you to a

253
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:36,880
different conclusion that facilitative

254
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:41,000
leaders are made and not

255
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,760
born I believe that the

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,560
charismatic

257
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:50,120
leader who provides Vision who provides

258
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,040
inspiration uh you you might try really

259
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,720
hard to become that my sense is that

260
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,760
carismatic leaders are

261
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,600
born it's not that they don't do

262
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,720
anything to improve themselves I just

263
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,120
don't think you can build yourself up

264
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,920
piece by piece to become

265
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,920
charismatic I really do think that's

266
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,800
either lucky or not lucky to be endowed

267
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,440
with

268
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:19,240
that ability as an inspirational

269
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,720
leader charismatic leaders I think are

270
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,839
more likely to be born than

271
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,480
made paternalistic

272
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:30,720
leaders that you we can train them I

273
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,399
think Sloan and H BS do a great

274
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,120
job I can't deny they've made a whole

275
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:38,720
lot of people like that I would like to

276
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,639
think that if we

277
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,480
tried D USP could make a whole lot of

278
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,920
facilitative leaders people who are

279
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,720
collaborative service providers in the

280
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,000
public sector on this question of our

281
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,800
facilitative leaders made not born I I

282
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
think facilitative leaders can be

283
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:04,040
made and there are people who

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,639
when it comes down to it say yeah a

285
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:11,360
facilitative leader can provide

286
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:14,480
Direction without taking

287
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,680
control they know that everyone has to

288
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,480
be involved in all the decisions

289
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:23,600
leadership in the public sector requires

290
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,040
different kinds of skills orientation

291
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,480
and a different Theory from leadership

292
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,160
in private organizational contexts I

293
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,440
counting on the

294
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:40,920
conversation over these uh four weeks uh

295
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:45,240
to maybe make a case the beginning of a

296
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:47,399
case to take to the department and say

297
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,399
what what exactly are you hoping I'm

298
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:52,680
going to turn out to

299
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:56,360
be don't tell me planner that do doesn't

300
00:14:52,680 --> 00:15:00,959
do it it has to be more than

301
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:06,519
that so we break for dinner and then um

302
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:08,480
I will ask you uh to uh consider some of

303
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,360
the questions from within what I've

304
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,399
presented I'm hoping to get from each of

305
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,550
you by the end of week four some

306
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:24,080
reflection on this proposition that I'm

307
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:24,080
[Music]

308
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:32,600
offering so public private any

309
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:36,600
important difference always sometimes

310
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:39,000
maybe second question facilitative

311
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,399
leaders are made not born does that

312
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,360
sound right to you and anybody become a

313
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:49,240
facilitative leader I mean leader I

314
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:55,360
don't just mean a facilitative person so

315
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:57,519
made not born public versus private and

316
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,360
can you cons really construe leadership

317
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,600
as service

318
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,279
you say I'm a leader I'm providing

319
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,680
service that's what I'm doing service in

320
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:09,720
the public interest that's the dominant

321
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,600
consideration in thinking about

322
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,600
leadership in the public sector can you

323
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:20,240
imagine yourself in a service role

324
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:23,360
someone who's recognized for the service

325
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,680
they provide in the public Arena so I

326
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,000
offer those three points um see where

327
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,839
the discussion goes take 20 minut

328
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,240
minutes meet somebody you don't know

329
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,000
talk to someone you do know and you

330
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:39,120
never get to talk

331
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,480
to one of my managers was like you need

332
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,680
to have the confidence to like assert

333
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,839
that make a decision and move forward

334
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,319
with it rather than trying to make

335
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,720
everything a collective decision when

336
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:52,639
you're like there's a group and I do

337
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,920
think there's kind of a gender Dynamic

338
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,920
involved in that where and I felt like I

339
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,560
was younger in the office I felt like oh

340
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,360
I should be deferring to all the other

341
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,800
people in his group uh in order to make

342
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,919
decisions I do think like women maybe

343
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,640
socialized to be more

344
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,880
facilitated uh rather than like turtle

345
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,799
or top down I don't want to say like a

346
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,480
taping role but it does begin to feel

347
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,360
like you're nurturing consciences sort

348
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,720
of timing to every news as opposed to

349
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,480
achieving the best station it kind of

350
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,559
feels like hurting cats sometimes and

351
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,480
there is a lot of emotional labor

352
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:33,200
involved understanding

353
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,720
social dynamics and power and political

354
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,799
Dynamics sometimes even like I don't

355
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,440
know like

356
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,960
babysitting you know it doesn't feel

357
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,480
like a sexy leader

358
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,559
role like it's definitely not I think if

359
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,919
you're delivering a product as opposed

360
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:53,640
to a service you don't have to have much

361
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,600
of it within just Mo drive and ambition

362
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,159
but if

363
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,320
you're leaning into

364
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,960
process which I think is like the nature

365
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:05,520
of filation like you need to be patient

366
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,320
with folks to provide the service I feel

367
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,200
like this can be very easily under

368
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,720
appreciated that's kind of service I

369
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:19,080
feel like maybe leadership does contain

370
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,280
a meaning of achieving a consensus like

371
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,880
we still need to lead people to

372
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,400
somewhere public sector is trying to

373
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,200
achieve our best to serve public

374
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,400
interest uh in public different voices

375
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,440
from multi stakeholders but for private

376
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,120
corporate they have a Clear Vision or a

377
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:42,039
clear goal that I want to create this

378
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,400
product there is no involvement of the

379
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:47,120
community in what we are doing the

380
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,960
corland is different than probably the

381
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,520
skills that you may need in terms of

382
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,080
leadership they may have commonalities

383
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,120
but I do believe that there are certain

384
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,480
differences my perception is that the

385
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,640
private sector is it's more it's more

386
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,760
Bur fault and it's more based on on

387
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,120
appointments and authori and in the

388
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,799
public sector in my experience you may

389
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,960
need a little more influence in the

390
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:13,280
public sector what's more dangerous is

391
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,080
that you're kind of putting on this

392
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,360
facade of like this is the public but

393
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,200
then the mechanisms there don't allow

394
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,320
people to equally come to the table the

395
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,320
of the public and private sectors are

396
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,000
different the the nature of leadership

397
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,240
should be different how do you think

398
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,240
like managing people differs the public

399
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:36,240
sector in many South European countries

400
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,000
you have to play a a low profile Asad as

401
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,200
no as an individual that wants to Aspire

402
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,360
as a leader I I have a heart type here

403
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,280
uh in the US in the US particularly yeah

404
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,880
I mean I've been working 20 years with

405
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,520
an Anglo Saxon organization that is the

406
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,240
UN and I think that this doesn't work in

407
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,080
other cultures in many cultures I think

408
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,000
it's very difficult to transpose these

409
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,799
styles of leadership wholesale but by

410
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,679
developing skills you can eventually

411
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,039
bestowed the power by the community

412
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,880
because they see that you are ready to

413
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:08,240
show up and you are aligned to their

414
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,400
values and that's very important is in

415
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,840
Japan for example they have a hard time

416
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,919
partnering and negotiating with

417
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,039
Americans they are self-confident and

418
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:20,440
spoken and and they are bold yes and

419
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:22,440
this boldness which here is considering

420
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,559
a skill and something positive you are

421
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,280
confident with yourself which don't take

422
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,720
me wrong it's not bad in certain

423
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:31,240
cultures could be considered arrogant

424
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,520
and it's important to play a more low

425
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,400
profile role so how was that very when

426
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,960
you're in that give it that's that's one

427
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,440
of the things is is empathy you reading

428
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,080
the room and you understand that for

429
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,720
example in the noric countries people

430
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,280
don't want to shine Ah that's people

431
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,919
don't want to shine the power of the

432
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,080
many noric countries is the community

433
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,559
itself while here in the state I can see

434
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,640
that this distinction you can see that

435
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,480
in movies and narrative a leader is

436
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,520
someone that shine that concept of

437
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,840
leadership doesn't apply every for us

438
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,080
reades working in Japan is perfect but

439
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,960
Americans they always have a CL septum

440
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,720
communities are are more like silent so

441
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,520
you don't have to discuss and I'm not

442
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,960
saying that they are better or worse

443
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,120
there are certain communities that they

444
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,720
have other value than a

445
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,840
financials this goes for public Evans I

446
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,360
think a lot of times you're rewarded for

447
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,720
just like doing your Curr job well which

448
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,760
a lot of just start out as like a

449
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,600
technical skill and then you can get

450
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,039
promoted to a manager role of people who

451
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,279
do that technical skin

452
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,400
but you're not taught how to be a

453
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:34,320
manager how to support people how to

454
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,799
develop their skills you're just like

455
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,840
really good at that

456
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:41,320
one things like empathy and being a good

457
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:43,480
listener are things that you know might

458
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,720
get I don't know kind of not embody

459
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,919
those qualities as much I'd honestly

460
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,720
like love to talk about the like

461
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,880
efficiency piece in the public sector

462
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,720
because cost efficiency is usually one

463
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,360
of the biggest conversations that

464
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,320
efficiency isn't articulated as like

465
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,640
anything come up that anybody felt

466
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,760
strongly about on any of those three

467
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:11,000
issues the concept of leadership as

468
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,520
service and we kind of had a maybe this

469
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,520
is a philosophical question about

470
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:18,440
whether there's a such thing as like

471
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,000
selfless leadership or is everyone

472
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,720
always at the back of their minds doing

473
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,880
something for their own benefit even if

474
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,120
you are facilitating trying to be a

475
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,679
facilitative leader do you get a little

476
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,520
ego Rush when you like make something

477
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:34,600
happen you know are we all at dust

478
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,440
because

479
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,559
we truly want to change the world or

480
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,440
because we think that we're important

481
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:47,520
enough to do that thank you thanks

482
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:51,919
Cris those who have some CTIC

483
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,880
characteristics will naturally be deer

484
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,320
so we opened up by discussing the

485
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,080
question of whether facilitative leaders

486
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,679
are made or war and uh we talked a

487
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:07,120
little bit about the role of gender and

488
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,720
race and sexuality in this question just

489
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,720
kind of speaking from my experience

490
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,679
being a woman in the public sector I

491
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,120
found myself deferring to a more

492
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:18,080
facilitative form of leadership when

493
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,039
maybe being a little bit more assertive

494
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,679
or um taking on more of a

495
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:25,120
decision-making role would have been

496
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:27,000
better um so I think that yeah kind of

497
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,960
thinking about the social dynamics

498
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,640
around whether someone is innately

499
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,840
facilitative is important a lot of the

500
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,760
time in public settings there's

501
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,880
apprehension to take that more

502
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,279
decision-making position just

503
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,840
because that's maybe not like the the

504
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:47,760
role that we've like historically

505
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:50,480
occupied and so we defer to potentially

506
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,440
more caretaking more

507
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,159
nurturing uh I guess like function in

508
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,440
decision making so we tend to build in

509
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,039
consensus rather than delegating respons

510
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,360
responsibility or asserting expertise in

511
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,120
a realm um because if you don't look

512
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,159
like the decision maker often times your

513
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:12,640
credibility could be reckoned challenged

514
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:15,559
pushed back against and so the next best

515
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,480
thing is often to maybe opt for

516
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,600
facilitation instead especially in a

517
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,360
public setting when when sometimes it

518
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,880
can be hard to Corral really cating

519
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,919
interest okay we have a very interesting

520
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,600
discussion on we may have in our minds a

521
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,440
concept of leader that perhaps is not

522
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,880
share with other parts of the world and

523
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,960
I think that this is very important

524
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,399
where we are defining some of the skills

525
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,360
that makes a leader because we are still

526
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:43,760
especially certain communities certain

527
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,039
societies create a sort of a narrative

528
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,240
in certain communities what leadership

529
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:51,960
should be we discuss that leaders are

530
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,360
made by the legitimacy that the

531
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,480
community give to someone what

532
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,760
legitimizes the leader and gives them

533
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,559
that capacity that authority to

534
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,279
influence all those folks usually we see

535
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,120
the arrow going the other way which is

536
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,360
the legitimacy of the leader is a

537
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,880
function of the support of the

538
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,600
population in the public Arena so the

539
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:18,240
arrow goes from the

540
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:20,320
constituency to the leader it all it's

541
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,799
providing

542
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,480
legitimacy and yet we're crediting the

543
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,840
leader with providing Direction and

544
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,840
helping everybody see what they're going

545
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,240
to do

546
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:35,200
so if we talk about legitimacy and

547
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:39,200
sources of legitimacy and we talk about

548
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,159
Authority and the sources of authority

549
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,279
and we can certainly compare public and

550
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:46,039
private there are very different sources

551
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,559
of legitimacy sources of authority if we

552
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:51,320
talk about responsibility comparing

553
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,919
leaders in the private sector versus

554
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,559
leaders in the public sector what's

555
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,360
their responsibility clearly this

556
00:25:55,559 --> 00:26:00,640
there's different right so if you begin

557
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,919
to pile up these differences and you say

558
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,880
all right so how is this public sector

559
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,159
leader

560
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,039
leading to get a different source of

561
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,120
authority different source of legitimacy

562
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:13,559
different nature of responsibility

563
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,200
forget about the skills they have or

564
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:18,720
don't have there's a big difference I

565
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,240
think now we can say oh you're just

566
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,120
saying that because you're looking at it

567
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,840
from a a a western perspective or you're

568
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,120
looking at it from a a US perspective uh

569
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,200
and that may be although

570
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,080
when I look at the sources of legitimacy

571
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,840
for leaders in some different countries

572
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:41,120
I can't find out I can't figure out what

573
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:44,640
they are I mean people have taken

574
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,240
leadership and it legitimacy wasn't the

575
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,120
issue they sort of took the leadership

576
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,960
I'm not saying they worked against an

577
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,799
electoral process in a democratic

578
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,880
context I'm saying but what gave them

579
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:59,159
credibility as a leader wasn't just that

580
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,240
they were elected my goodness

581
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:05,080
that something else gave them

582
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,240
credibility gave them the right to

583
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,679
exercise

584
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,960
Authority and I'm wondering what their

585
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:14,600
sense of responsibility was I know that

586
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,640
those three things are different when I

587
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,640
talk to and watch leaders in the public

588
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:24,440
Arena versus leadership in a private

589
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:28,000
company and we didn't get to discuss

590
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,960
what you mean by the public interest

591
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,120
right we're we're presuming the

592
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,120
responsibility partly to the Public's

593
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,039
interest as part at least of what a

594
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,000
leader in the public sector has to do

595
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:45,559
and then where do they get satisfaction

596
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,880
the questions that you raised first what

597
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:50,519
do they think success means and what

598
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:54,120
does it give them what does it generate

599
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:57,399
for them I said earlier that if you take

600
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:59,360
service seriously as a model that you

601
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:02,840
would include in that ability put your

602
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:06,159
ego aside I don't mean you have no ego I

603
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:08,720
mean the issue is when I rank my

604
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,360
responsibilities what's first and when

605
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,240
there's a tradeoff what's dominant and

606
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:18,200
over time

607
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:22,720
consistently and my sense is that we've

608
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:25,760
got to talk about being an effective

609
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,799
leader who can meet the public

610
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:32,120
interest but also this satis action that

611
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,360
comes from being effective in that role

612
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,720
and that's for that person I don't mean

613
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:41,279
to erase any of that when I talk about

614
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,559
Service as the primary model yes people

615
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,880
still will

616
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,880
pursue the things that satisfy them that

617
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,000
they're going to be motivated not just

618
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,360
by being in service not just by meeting

619
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,640
the public interest but by doing a good

620
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,559
job being recognized for that it's just

621
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:04,320
what's got priority when tradeoffs have

622
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:07,559
to be made what's the

623
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,919
primary objective will come back to them

624
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:14,559
but born versus

625
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:17,679
made public versus private when we make

626
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:21,880
these distinctions do we end up with a

627
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:25,320
model of a leader that we would admire

628
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:28,279
in any country in the

629
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:31,000
world Maybe not maybe there's just

630
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:34,320
radical differences by culture and

631
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,480
context and location I'm very prepared

632
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,279
to hear that that's a view that's come

633
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,760
out of everybody the levels of

634
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:46,200
governance uh Power relationships and

635
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,840
power dynamics responsibility and even

636
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,840
impact that the public and private

637
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,600
sector may have they also would be

638
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,559
reflected on some skills and

639
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,679
characteristics that we be shared by

640
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:02,640
both of them them there are certain

641
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,919
characteristics and skills and nuanced

642
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,080
and in even political sense that you

643
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:09,000
will need in the public sector more than

644
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,720
in the private sector in order to move

645
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,679
forward initiatives in order to create

646
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:19,000
consensus in order to engage with

647
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:21,320
different communities um so we thought

648
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,960
that it could be a little bit more

649
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,480
complex in the public sector and

650
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,039
therefore those skills must be

651
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,440
enhanced something that we just

652
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:31,880
discussed is the difference in the

653
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,039
public sector versus the private sector

654
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,600
of the accountability measures and how

655
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:38,440
in a lot of different

656
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,000
contexts across the world the public

657
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,480
sector a big fault is that you might

658
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,679
have a good relationship with people

659
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,519
that you're interacting with through a

660
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,440
public process but if there is no

661
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,840
tangible outcome that people see from

662
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,000
their time and efforts people are going

663
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,360
to be frustrated and disempowered by the

664
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,559
process and then they'll be much less

665
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:03,159
likely or even ref used to participate

666
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:04,760
again and in the private sector that is

667
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:06,480
just not really something that people

668
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,480
have to navigate because the

669
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,159
accountability is already built into the

670
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,200
leadership role and then we talked a

671
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,600
little bit about the leaders

672
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,679
facilitative leaders are made or born

673
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,559
and I think collectively we did talk

674
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:23,399
about they're mostly made because a lot

675
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,240
of qualities that you did point out like

676
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:27,919
empathy or active listening or putting

677
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,919
your ego aside or organizational

678
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,960
learning I feel like are things you

679
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,279
learn by actually interacting with

680
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,760
people by doing this again and again

681
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:38,960
this process we need to stop thinking of

682
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,919
this one person needs to have all of

683
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,279
these qualities and maybe just think

684
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:48,080
along the lines of how you can continue

685
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:52,159
to do it better thank you okay um we'll

686
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:55,600
meet again same time next week think

687
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,200
about your own view of what makes a

688
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,480
leader in the public sector successful

689
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,919
okay so do think about that thank you

690
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,910
all so much for coming and we'll see you

691
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,380
next week

692
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:32,599
[Applause]

693
