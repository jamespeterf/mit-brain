1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,240
Good afternoon. [clears throat] I

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,160
realize I'm sitting here standing here

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,240
between you and your lunch. So I'll be

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,960
quick. Five slides only. Uh so uh Zafino

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,759
um my name is Sanjay Marander uh founder

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,320
CEO and uh we started this company

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,279
literally uh last year late last year

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,480
and we saw a need a need that we felt

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,680
this generation of AI can actually help

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,119
and this is about uh managing compliance

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,760
and staying compliant right so we're uh

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,640
initially targeting highly regulated uh

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,920
dibs stands for defense industrial base

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,399
and in particular

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,879
There's one particular um um

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,000
regulation called CMMC which literally

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,680
went live a few days ago, November 11th.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,600
So that means dibs have now one year to

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,000
be compliant and provide a cert to the

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,480
US government if the US government is

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,480
their customer whether you're small or

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,879
large you're going to have to provide

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,720
thatert and so as a result we felt

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,119
there's a cliff coming and this is a

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,720
very very large problem and primarily

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,280
it's uh a very difficult problem because

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,960
to date it has been a very manual

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,080
process it's very uh you know disjointed

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,920
fragmented

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,400
And because it's manual, a lot of

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,439
consulting hours get used and that means

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,640
it tends to be extremely expensive. And

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,799
we felt there's got to be a way to

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,600
ingest all this disperate data. Uh

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,240
yep. So yeah. So the solution that we

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,159
came up with is initially we said let's

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,960
uh target the uh defense industrial base

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,040
uh with uh a product we call integrity.

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,759
And what you're seeing here is the

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,479
dashboard. What we're doing uh generally

41
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:57,439
is that there's a uh a framework whereby

42
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,079
our framework can ingest any kind of

43
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,159
documentation policies uh that you may

44
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,079
have and we compare that with the rule

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,439
book and initially the rule book for

46
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,479
integrity is CMMC and what we're doing

47
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,200
is in not months which is what typically

48
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,400
happens if you're using consulting hours

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,319
in uh minutes we're going to give you a

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,120
view of where you stand And what you're

51
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,760
seeing here are 110 controls in that

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,840
dashboard top left. That's for CMMC. And

53
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,440
it will very quickly tell you how many

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,840
you've met, how many you partially met,

55
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,239
and how many you've not met instantly.

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,080
And then we'll tell you also what what

57
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,000
you need to do to get to the next level.

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,680
You might we might say, "Hey, uh you're

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,599
28% compliant today." And we we'll say

60
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,680
do these three things next. And oh, by

61
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,160
the way, the people responsible that

62
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,200
need to do these are also these various

63
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,360
folks. your CFO, your uh director of IT

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,760
and so forth. And we'll tell you how

65
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,760
many uh percentage points you'll gain.

66
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,480
Our goal is to get you to 100% as

67
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,200
quickly as possible and also to do it

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,760
reliably. We actually, you know, we all

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,519
know about hallucination by AI systems

70
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,080
and all that. Compliance is a

71
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,760
deterministic system. So that's why we

72
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,440
have a little bit of human in the loop,

73
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,920
but at the same time, we need to get you

74
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,480
to 100% before you present yourself to

75
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,800
the auditors. And of course uh uh what

76
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,360
what typically is happening here is the

77
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,680
reason you want to even do this uh is

78
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,800
because compliance is sitting between

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,879
you and your revenue and if uh you're a

80
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,360
a government contractor sometimes it's a

81
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,920
lot of revenue and the government now

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,760
has said it's not an episodic process.

83
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,680
You need to be continuously compliant

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,360
and you know people throw up their arms

85
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,560
because it's not going to be possible.

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:48,400
So here's our uh a typical uh customer.

87
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,560
One of our uh customers uh she's a CISO

88
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,480
where the government portion of the you

89
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
know business is about 100 million and

90
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,799
she has to be compliant by November

91
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,920
2026. She doesn't even know where to

92
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,480
start, right? And so and certainly there

93
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,439
and typically you're spending 400 to

94
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,519
500k for something like this. and she's

95
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,840
told us there's just no chance we're

96
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,319
going to uh you know uh have that kind

97
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,840
of budget and we don't have uh you know

98
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:19,680
a year of consulting hours. So um uh the

99
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,840
first project is of course uh first

100
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,080
product of course is in uh dibs uh but

101
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,479
the reason we're here is because we know

102
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,960
in the audience we have a lot of ILP uh

103
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,120
you know members who are uh in

104
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,160
industrial as well as insurance finance

105
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,080
healthcare and you all man you all uh

106
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,960
need different compliance requirements

107
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,880
from various regulatory bodies and so if

108
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,479
we can be of help to you because we are

109
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,960
looking for design partners

110
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,360
Uh please come uh say hello. We're next

111
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,040
door again. My name is Sanjay Maranda

112
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,199
and very happy to be here for the second

113
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,753
time with second company at ILP. Thank

114
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,773
you.

115
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,773
[applause]
