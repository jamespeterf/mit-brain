1
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,408
All right, good
morning, everyone.

2
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,110
My name is Robin
Wolfe Scheffler.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,645
I'm from the MIT program
on Science, Technology,

4
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:13,513
and Society.

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,649
And it's my pleasure
to introduce this panel

6
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:18,651
on revolutions.

7
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,620
As you've seen this
morning, people commonly

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,223
talk about the life
sciences in the modern era

9
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,525
as one of revolutions--
the revolution of DNA,

10
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:29,162
the revolution of informatics,
the revolution of gene editing.

11
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,097
As a historian of
the life sciences,

12
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,766
however, I'm not
quite sure if this

13
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,068
is the metaphor we want for
talking about the work we

14
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,970
do here at MIT.

15
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,838
A revolution, if
you'll remember,

16
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,741
implies a violent turning
over of the world.

17
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,911
Indeed, philosophers of science
who have looked at revolutions

18
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:48,048
have gone so far as to suggest
that the worlds of science

19
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,949
before and after
a revolution are

20
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,418
incommensurable with each other.

21
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:55,688
There can't be any dialogue,
only misunderstanding.

22
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:58,124
Speaking in revolutionary
terms, therefore,

23
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:02,362
risks obscuring the rich history
of work at a place like MIT

24
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:04,864
and dismissing its importance
to the present day.

25
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:07,534
And I think this gives us
a shallow understanding

26
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,369
of the types of
innovation and cooperation

27
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,938
that make our Institute unique.

28
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:16,076
A better metaphor than
revolutions, if all be forgiven,

29
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,477
is that of waves.

30
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,815
If you think about a stream
of drops landing on a pond,

31
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,450
the force of each
wave might dissipate.

32
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,319
The discovery of DNA
becomes ubiquitous as a tool

33
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,088
for research over time.

34
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,322
However, it's still there.

35
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,125
It still shapes every
subsequent type of work.

36
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,894
New drops on the
pond add and interact

37
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,897
with others that came
before it, creating

38
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,066
new and unexpected patterns.

39
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,135
And I think this
sounds much more

40
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,970
like the work that's
happened at MIT,

41
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,472
as we've heard from
Professor Sharp

42
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,974
and we will hear from the
speakers in this panel.

43
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:50,710
Ideas and institutions
build upon each other,

44
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,081
rather than violently replacing
or superseding one another.

45
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:59,586
New people and new ideas
find new uses for old tools,

46
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,688
and they combine them
with their new knowledge.

47
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:04,090
The story is not
one of displacement

48
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:08,194
but of constructive interference
and intermingling of science

49
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,563
and engineering to produce
unexpected and new ways

50
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:13,199
of knowing life that
could only happen here.

51
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,503
MIT is so special precisely
because our pond, if you will,

52
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:20,340
has seen so many
drops land upon it.

53
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,710
So, without further
ado, it's my pleasure

54
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,713
to introduce three
speakers who have both

55
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,249
made their share of
waves at MIT and have

56
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,051
seen many wash upon its shores.

57
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:36,222
First, Tyler Jacks, who
is the David H. Koch

58
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,558
professor of biology,
a Daniel K. Ludwig

59
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:41,427
scholar, the co-director of
the Ludwig Center at MIT.

60
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,264
And he's going to speak to
the long history of assembling

61
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:48,501
genetics, informatics, and
technology to study cancer.

62
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,703
Second, Douglas
Lauffenburger, who's

63
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,172
the Ford Professor
of Engineering

64
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,407
and a founding professor
of the modern Department

65
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,942
of Biological Engineering.

66
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,478
He's going to speak to the
entry of engineering approaches

67
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,948
into the study of life as a
novel way of studying and doing

68
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:02,916
science.

69
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,385
And finally, Ruth
Lehmann is the director

70
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,087
of the Whitehead Institute
and a professor of biology.

71
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,890
She is going to highlight the
long work of the Institute

72
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,026
in combining
approaches, old and new,

73
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,229
to understand the complicated
and rewarding question of life's

74
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,530
complexity itself.

75
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,932
So, without further
ado, I'd like

76
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,601
to bring Tyler
Jacks to the stage.

77
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,970
[APPLAUSE]

78
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,740

79
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,875
Well, thanks, Robin.

80
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,009
And welcome, everybody.

81
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:30,910
Thanks for joining us.

82
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,546
I'm personally extremely
excited that we're here today,

83
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,349
celebrating the
launch of MIT HEALS.

84
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,451
As you heard, I was
involved with Kris Prather

85
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,919
in leading a faculty
committee that

86
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,188
led to a series
of recommendations

87
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:44,524
that arguably brought
us to this point.

88
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:48,528
And I'm just so excited about
what this collaborative will

89
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:52,498
do for our community, for our
region, and really for the world

90
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,335
as it relates to
advances in life science

91
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,837
and, importantly, in health.

92
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:02,308
I've been asked to talk a little
bit about cancer research at MIT

93
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,811
and tell the MIT cancer
research story, which

94
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,080
I'm very happy to do.

95
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,214
It's a long story.

96
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,751
It goes back, as you heard
from Phil Sharp, 50 years now.

97
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,220
In fact, we're celebrating
the 50th anniversary of cancer

98
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,990
research on the MIT
campus this year.

99
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,460
It began modestly in this
converted candy factory

100
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,895
on Ames Street,
where MIT decided

101
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,132
to invest in molecular biology
and recombinant DNA technology

102
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,967
to understand the
mysteries of cancer.

103
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,636
And that effort, as
you heard from Phil,

104
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,505
was massively successful and
really laid the foundations

105
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,808
for modern-day
molecular oncology.

106
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,444
Over the years, many,
many MIT faculty

107
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,912
got interested in
cancer research.

108
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,215
It really touches every
corner of our University.

109
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:47,420
And in response to that, we've
created the Koch Institute,

110
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,590
which embodies this
spirit of collaboration,

111
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,259
as Phil called it,
convergence, bringing together

112
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:57,764
multiple disciplines to
address and hopefully overcome

113
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,399
the challenges of cancer.

114
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,601
The Koch Institute
is a physical entity.

115
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,504
But it also connects many
aspects of the MIT community

116
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,973
around these most
important problems.

117
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,641
And I'll touch on
some of the activities

118
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,779
that the Koch Institute faculty
are working on today and project

119
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,746
on into the future.

120
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:18,251
But I want to begin looking
backwards again to the Cancer

121
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,185
Center.

122
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,587
This is a picture similar
to one that Phil showed you

123
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:24,691
of a group of investigators who
were recruited to the Cancer

124
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:27,026
Center, including Bob
Weinberg, Nancy Hopkins, who

125
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,096
was showed in the previous
image, David Baltimore, Salvador

126
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,932
Luria, and Phil Sharp
himself, thinking about,

127
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,301
how do cancer cells
arise from normal cells?

128
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,737
What are the changes
at the molecular level

129
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:38,938
that drive that process?

130
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,673
And Bob Weinberg,
who's circled here,

131
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,943
was interested in the question
of whether normal genes are

132
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,779
altered through mutation in
the development of cancer cells

133
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,747
from normal cells.

134
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,750
And he set about to find
the first cancer gene.

135
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,821
And after some years of
effort, he and his lab group

136
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,791
published three really
landmark papers in 1982

137
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,427
describing the first
human cancer gene.

138
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,864
It was called HRAS, which is
mutated in bladder cancer.

139
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,199
That was where it was found.

140
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,967
But it and its
cousins are now known

141
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:12,305
to be mutated in many different
very important human cancers,

142
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:15,375
including lung cancer and
colon cancer and pancreas

143
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,943
cancer, and more.

144
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:20,380
It really is an important
driver of the cancer process.

145
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,716
It becomes an oncogene
through a very subtle change

146
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,719
in the DNA, a single
nucleotide change, which leads

147
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,087
to a single amino acid change.

148
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,023
And that converts the
protein to an oncogenic form.

149
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,259
And the hope of
that research was

150
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,428
that, if we could understand
cancer at this level,

151
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,564
we could actually address it
molecularly and maybe find

152
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,100
new drugs that
target this altered

153
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,836
protein and similar
altered proteins

154
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,973
and bring about more effective
treatments for the disease.

155
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,508
That has happened.

156
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,176
And I'll touch on that briefly.

157
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,578
It happened here too,
but it took a long time.

158
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,047
RAS turned out to be a
very difficult problem.

159
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,717
And it actually took
nearly 40 years,

160
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:01,287
investigators from
academia and then industry,

161
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,523
to target altered RAS.

162
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:09,262
But in 2001, first Amgen and
then Mirati, now owned by BMS,

163
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:13,132
successfully developed
KRAS-targeting drugs,

164
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,902
which have been approved
by the FDA in lung cancer

165
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,304
and more recently
in colon cancer.

166
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,139
And this represents
a major shift

167
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:23,109
in our ability to control
those cancers that I

168
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,012
mentioned that have
KRAS and other RAS gene

169
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,681
mutations as drivers.

170
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:33,186
So that was then, a
single cancer gene, 1982.

171
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,756
This is now, where, with the
advent of high-throughput

172
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:39,759
DNA-sequencing technologies, the
sequencing of the human genome,

173
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,793
as you heard from Phil--

174
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:45,198
major contributions by the Broad
Institute and others at MIT--

175
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:50,803
we now have collectively
sequenced probably close

176
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,739
to a million cancer
genomes by now

177
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:57,109
and discovered not just one
human cancer gene but probably

178
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:00,546
500 cancer genes,
genes that are altered

179
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,615
by mutation in human cancers.

180
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,718
And there's more than a hundred
molecularly targeted drugs

181
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,220
like these that I'm
showing you here

182
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,888
that have been
approved by the FDA

183
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,390
for the treatment of cancers
with those alterations.

184
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,360
So the promise from 1982
has actually borne true

185
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,530
in spectacular fashion.

186
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,799
These genes are
mutated sometimes

187
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,701
rarely in a given
cancer but sometimes

188
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,236
commonly across many cancers.

189
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,239
This is an analysis
done by investigators

190
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,508
in a large international
collaboration,

191
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,310
including the Broad
Institute investigators,

192
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,515
looking at 26 commonly mutated
cancer genes across here,

193
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,483
26 different cancer types.

194
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:41,187
And again, this allows
for molecular diagnostics

195
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,624
to identify particular cancers
with particular alterations that

196
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:48,160
allows them to be treated with
targeted, more precise cancer

197
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,330
medicines that are having
significant benefit.

198
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,599
Now, at MIT, we're
approaching the complexity

199
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:57,270
of cancer, this myriad of
mutations in cancer genes,

200
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,505
in lots of different ways.

201
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,642
We have expertise in
my lab and elsewhere

202
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:06,946
at the Institute in modeling the
molecular alterations in cancer

203
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,948
in genetically
engineered mouse models.

204
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,384
And we can do this using
a variety of techniques

205
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:15,121
to very accurately model what
happens in human cancer cells

206
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,891
but in a tractable experimental
model system, the mouse.

207
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,260
And these tools
are useful not just

208
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,664
to understand the molecular
development of the disease

209
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,732
but also what one
can do about it.

210
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,736
How can you use these models to
detect cancer at earlier stages

211
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,039
or treat it more effectively
or maybe intercept

212
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,009
its progression from its early
stages to its later stages?

213
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:41,681
And this is very active and
fertile ground here at MIT.

214
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,951
The technologies for making
genetically engineered mouse

215
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:47,353
models have improved
dramatically over the years.

216
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:51,023
I started this work myself
here at MIT in 1988.

217
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,159
And it was very difficult
to do back then.

218
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,929
Now, with tools like CRISPR, we
can do this very, very easily.

219
00:09:56,929 --> 00:10:00,333
And the most recent
version of CRISPR tools

220
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,768
that we use in this
process is called

221
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,105
prime editing, a method
developed by David Liu

222
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:10,142
at the Broad Institute,
which takes the Cas9 enzyme,

223
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,712
modifies it so that it no longer
makes a double-stranded DNA,

224
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:16,449
but rather a single-strand
nick, and then fuse that nickase

225
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,118
to a piece of reverse
transcriptase,

226
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,654
an enzyme that will
take an RNA template

227
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,223
and convert it into a DNA form.

228
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,691
This was actually
a discovery made

229
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,960
by David Baltimore, which
was the thing that won him

230
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,229
the Nobel Prize in 1975.

231
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:34,233
And you can therefore feed this
enzyme a long extended guide

232
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:37,403
RNA that will bring it
to a place in the genome

233
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,606
but also have an extension on
it that has a mutation, shown

234
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,574
in red here.

235
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,210
And the reverse
transcriptase activity

236
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,780
will then convert that
mutation in RNA form into DNA.

237
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,350
And that DNA will then be
transferred into the genome

238
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,452
at that specific position.

239
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,955
This is an incredibly
powerful technology.

240
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,391
We've used it in
collaboration with David's lab

241
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,227
to make mice that
carry the prime editor.

242
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,230
And now, in a
simple system where

243
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,833
one designs a guide RNA
carrying a mutation of interest,

244
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,603
one can introduce that into
animals and mutate genes

245
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,105
at any position in vivo.

246
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,874
And we've done that
in one example,

247
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,044
again bringing us back
to the RAS oncogene,

248
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,681
to look at different
alleles of KRAS

249
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,350
and how they affect tumor
development here in the lung.

250
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,185
And I won't belabor
this point, but suffice

251
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,953
it to say that different
mutations cause

252
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,422
different phenotypes.

253
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,990
They all cause cancer, yes.

254
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,759
But some of them, G12R
here, causes a much more

255
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,862
profound cancer phenotype than
the other three for reasons

256
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,064
that we don't understand.

257
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,699
But in all likelihood,
this is teaching

258
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,168
us something very important
about the biology of RAS

259
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,671
and how, ultimately, we
will want to target it.

260
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:49,208
We can do this in a gene-by-gene
and allele-by-allele fashion

261
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,409
today.

262
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:56,048
But we are also able to use
massively parallel methods using

263
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:00,152
CRISPR-based libraries to
mutate many genes simultaneously

264
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,823
or create many alleles
of genes simultaneously.

265
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,392
This is the work of
Francisco Sánchez-Rivera,

266
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,561
assistant professor
in the Koch Institute,

267
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,964
who has developed methods to
introduce, via prime editing,

268
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:17,470
whole libraries of guide RNAs to
mutate a given gene of interest

269
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,208
at every position, to create a
massive number of alleles across

270
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,377
that gene, ones that are
known to be mutated in cancer

271
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:28,614
and others that perhaps are
not yet known but might be

272
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,182
discovered in the future.

273
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,852
And by this method,
by introducing

274
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:36,222
a range of mutations in
a pool of cancer cells,

275
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,425
one can then subject them to
a variety of functional tests

276
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,429
to determine the consequences
of these individual alterations

277
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,131
and, again, help
predict what will

278
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,066
happen when we find
these mutations

279
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,568
in the clinic in the future.

280
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,403
Now, I've spent most
of my time this morning

281
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,939
talking about biology
and molecular biology

282
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,975
and genetic engineering.

283
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,576
But as I mentioned,
the Koch Institute

284
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:01,947
is also about the convergence
of engineering and science.

285
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,383
And so I want to give a few
examples of technologies

286
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,187
from the engineering domain
that are actively being pursued

287
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,223
and are impacting how
cancer patients are treated

288
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:14,426
and also how we discover
cancer in the future.

289
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:17,730
Phil mentioned that one of
the focuses of our research

290
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,301
is to find new ways to deliver
medicines to cells, including

291
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,035
cancer cells.

292
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,371
And we have great
expertise in nanotechnology

293
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,908
in Dan Anderson's lab, Paul
Hammond's lab, Bob Langer's lab.

294
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,210
They're leaders in this space.

295
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,879
But we're also
interested in using

296
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,715
new engineering-based
methods to deliver

297
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,218
more conventional
drugs, including

298
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:40,820
conventional chemotherapy.

299
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,490
You might be surprised to learn
that chemotherapy is used today,

300
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,826
and the dose of
chemotherapy is used today,

301
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,495
based on formulas
that were developed

302
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:53,465
more than a hundred years ago
that simply asked the body

303
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,001
size of the individual
who's being treated based

304
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,604
on their height
and their weight.

305
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,273
And by this very simple
formula, regardless

306
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:04,577
of the particular
individual, whether they

307
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,545
be very tall, short,
and heavy, they

308
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,614
might get the exact
same dose of drug.

309
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,217
And the distribution of the drug
in those two different people

310
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,751
is likely to be
very, very different.

311
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,854
And their genetics is
likely to be very different.

312
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,689
And their metabolism is
likely to be very different.

313
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,191
But the formula doesn't pay
attention to any of that.

314
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,161
And so Louis DeRidder,
a graduate student

315
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,964
in Bob Langer's lab
and Gio Traverso's lab,

316
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,066
working with collaborators
at the Dana-Farber,

317
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,934
decided to try to
bring technology

318
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,737
to solve this problem in
a very simple fashion,

319
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:35,207
to develop a closed-loop
system that would actively

320
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:38,410
measure the concentration of a
drug, like a chemotherapeutic,

321
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,246
while the patient
is being treated

322
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,615
to test the concentration
of that drug in real time

323
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:46,719
and then adjust the dose as
a function of the measurement

324
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,821
of the drug in the bloodstream.

325
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,489
They call this system CLAUDIA.

326
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,724
And it's not just an idea.

327
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,992
They've actually built it.

328
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,094
Again, the concept
with CLAUDIA dosing

329
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:59,331
is that one can actively measure
and therefore monitor and adjust

330
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,701
dosing so that the dose of the
drug in that individual patient

331
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,571
will be at the desired amount.

332
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,275
Whereas with the body surface
area dosing shown on the lower

333
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,311
left, one would
overshoot in some cases,

334
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,747
undershoot in others, depending
on the various factors

335
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,049
that I mentioned previously.

336
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,417
They've built this device.

337
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,352
They've tested it in
an animal model so far.

338
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,921
And what you can
see from these data

339
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,356
is that, compared to the
standard approach, which

340
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,392
overshoots in this
particular example,

341
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,260
leading potentially
to overdosing,

342
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,230
with the CLAUDIA system, they
can get very, very consistent

343
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,399
dosing across long
periods of time.

344
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,668
So it's my prediction
that, before very long,

345
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,536
this technology will
be used in the clinic

346
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:42,908
to improve efficacy and avoid
toxicity in cancer patients.

347
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,378
So for today, we need to be
able to treat cancer patients.

348
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,614
We need to develop new
precision medicines.

349
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,849
But as we look to
the future, I think

350
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,919
we can imagine a better time
when we can avoid cancer

351
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,288
altogether, when we can
predict more accurately who's

352
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,057
going to develop
cancer and intercept it

353
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,692
at a very early stage.

354
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,627
And here I want to
close with an example

355
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,530
from Regina Barzilay,
which does exactly

356
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,099
that, using the power of
artificial intelligence

357
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,435
to predict the future of cancer.

358
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:11,670
And this is a personal
story for Regina

359
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,308
because she herself developed
breast cancer in 2014.

360
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:20,679
And she, during that
journey, asked her doctors,

361
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,614
why couldn't you have
known this was coming?

362
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:25,217
You take an image of
my breast every year.

363
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,653
Surely there was something
there at an earlier stage

364
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,489
that would have told you that
I was going to get cancer.

365
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,326
And they put their hands up and
said, we do the best we can.

366
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,695
But Regina wasn't
satisfied with that answer.

367
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,897
And so she wanted to
know, perhaps there

368
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,134
are latent signals in
mammographic images

369
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,770
that would tell you that
there's a cancer coming

370
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,305
at some future time.

371
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,608
And so she then collaborated
with colleagues from the Mass

372
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:53,679
General Hospital and
elsewhere to use AI technology

373
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,615
and deep learning algorithms
to ask the question,

374
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,019
if you train computers
with thousands of images

375
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,788
from women who didn't get breast
cancer in the future, ones who

376
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:04,923
did in three years
or in five years,

377
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,625
can you actually
develop an algorithm

378
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:10,229
that can accurately, or at
least more accurately, assess

379
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,964
the risk of an individual?

380
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,133
And I'm happy to say
that this has worked.

381
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,968
In a paper published
a few years ago,

382
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,770
they demonstrated
that they can develop

383
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,174
a neural network which is quite
predictive in assessing risk.

384
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:25,744
It dramatically
outperforms the standard

385
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,813
used in the field
today, which are

386
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:31,316
based on things like family
history of disease or age

387
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,719
but nothing about the
particulars of the individual.

388
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,321
The AI-driven
model, called MIRAI,

389
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:40,025
greatly outperforms
that technology.

390
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:43,162
And because it was
developed initially

391
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:46,231
with a data set from a
limited number of hospitals,

392
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:52,004
they've now moved beyond and
tested these systems with data

393
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,573
from seven different
hospitals across three

394
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,874
different continents.

395
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,410
And the algorithm
works equally well,

396
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,513
if not a little bit better, with
those diverse data sets, which

397
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,348
is very, very encouraging.

398
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,418
And this has now been
implemented across the world.

399
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,354
This slide says there's
1.7 million mammograms that

400
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,223
have been screened by MIRAI.

401
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,224
I checked this morning.

402
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,059
We're up to 1.9 million.

403
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,562
So this is being
dramatically rolled out

404
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:21,700
to improve the doctor's ability
to accurately predict and then

405
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,470
monitor patients who are at
the highest risk of developing

406
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,638
breast cancer in the future.

407
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,741
So I'll close there
and remind you

408
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:33,045
that we're celebrating 50 years
of cancer research at MIT.

409
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,115
It's been a long and
remarkably successful journey.

410
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,784
But I think the best
is still yet to come.

411
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,752
We at MIT have
tremendous strengths

412
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,589
across our great University
to bring technologies

413
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:47,326
from far and wide to apply
to these difficult problems.

414
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,262
And I think with the
MIT HEALS initiative,

415
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,232
we have potential to
do that much more.

416
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,401
So I'll stop there and thank
you for your attention.

417
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,738
And I'll now introduce my
colleague, Doug Lauffenburger,

418
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,640
who will take it from here.

419
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,076
[APPLAUSE]

420
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:10,549

421
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,250
Morning.

422
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,354
I'm very appreciative to be able
to participate here and provide

423
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:21,193
a complementary partnership
perspective from engineering,

424
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:28,233
celebrating alongside the
remarkable past of Life Sciences

425
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:33,071
at MIT and anticipating
the surely even

426
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:37,376
more remarkable future ahead.

427
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:42,548
So I need to start from this
engineering perspective of what

428
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,082
engineering contributes.

429
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,718
Engineers create
technologies to be

430
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:50,789
useful to solve problems and
address challenges in society.

431
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,592
They do this by
bringing together

432
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:58,764
manipulation of components
and making new components

433
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,033
to construct these technologies.

434
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,068
But they do it in
a manner that's

435
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:07,472
going to be predictive rather
than trial and error, which

436
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:12,578
involves quantitative
measurement and modeling, so

437
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,746
synthesis and analysis.

438
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:18,817
And as was pointed out
by our Dean of Science,

439
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:21,253
you can't translate
anything from nothing.

440
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,755
And so the engineering
technologies

441
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:27,025
are grounded in particular
branches of science.

442
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:30,662
And that's really what defines
the discipline of engineering,

443
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:33,332
is what is its
foundational science

444
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,702
that it's going to
measure and model

445
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:39,805
and then it's going to
manipulate and make from?

446
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:43,408
So examples include mechanical
engineering and electrical

447
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,946
engineering, firmly grounded
in the realms of physics,

448
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:51,683
and chemical engineering,
materials engineering,

449
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:55,988
firmly grounded in the
science of chemistry.

450
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,724
Those are very well
established examples.

451
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,859
And, of course,
what happens then

452
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:03,161
is these engineering
disciplines are

453
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:07,032
aimed at a spectrum
of application realms.

454
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:11,637
Could be manufacturing, energy,
transportation, environment,

455
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:13,672
including medicine and health.

456
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,675
And so engineers
will bring together

457
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,345
their analysis and synthesis
of their branches of science

458
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,214
to address these problems.

459
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,750

460
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:30,889
And in fact, in the engineering
world, ever since the 1950s,

461
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:34,760
these classical engineering
disciplines have been applied

462
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,230
very effectively to
medicine and health,

463
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:44,436
with outcomes such as
prosthetics, kidney dialysis,

464
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:48,273
heart pumps, imaging,
drug delivery.

465
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:50,976
And these all came
from the physics-

466
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,379
and chemistry-based
engineering disciplines that

467
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,882
existed at that point in time.

468
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:58,517
And so if you look
back, you could

469
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:03,655
call this-- this really was mid-
to late-20th-century convergence

470
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:08,293
of engineering disciplines
with medicine and health,

471
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:11,563
just that minimal
biology was involved.

472
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,599
And so when people talked
about biomedical engineering,

473
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:20,605
it was a big M for medical and
a very, very tiny b for bio

474
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:24,443
because it really was not
involved in a substantial way.

475
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,978
Nonetheless, it was
the right convergence

476
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:31,283
for that time pre
the revolutions

477
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,752
that Phil talked about.

478
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:37,889
So since that time, since
the '50s, '60s, '70s types

479
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:41,693
of convergence, there have been
indeed these two major life

480
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,562
science revolutions or waves.

481
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,897
I like the notion of waves.

482
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,367
Molecular biology,
being the first,

483
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:53,205
permits biological science
to be fused with engineering.

484
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,575
Engineers can use molecular
and cellular components

485
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,578
to make new biological
technologies.

486
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:03,482
So that enables the
biological engineering.

487
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:07,586
The second one being the
genomic biology revolution.

488
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:11,990
And that, in fact,
requires bioscience to be

489
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,361
fused with engineering on the
highly quantitative measurement

490
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:21,700
scale modeling to
understand and model

491
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,369
in a predictive way
these very complex

492
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:27,973
molecular cellular systems
so that the new biological

493
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:32,477
technologies synthesized from
molecular biology revolution

494
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:36,114
can now be analyzed in
a predictive way based

495
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:37,849
on the genomic
biology revolution.

496
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,718
So you see, those
two revolutions

497
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,088
laid the foundation for a
brand new kind of engineering

498
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,458
that was not
possible before them.

499
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,094

500
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,797
Not surprisingly,
MIT is the place

501
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:55,000
at which this new
biological engineering

502
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,902
discipline was created.

503
00:23:56,902 --> 00:24:02,040
In 1998, it was established,
became a full-fledged department

504
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,110
in 2005, and became course 20.

505
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,012
And what you see is
that it now stands

506
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:11,183
alongside the physics-based and
the chemistry-based engineering

507
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,050
disciplines.

508
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,788
But now its science foundation
is molecular biology

509
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,557
and genomic biology.

510
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:22,527
And from that foundation,
it can make technologies

511
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:25,897
in a predictively
designed way to apply

512
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:30,135
to manufacturing, energy,
environment, defense,

513
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,204
and medicine and health.

514
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:36,041
So it's alongside those
in being able to address

515
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:40,979
the challenges across the
entire spectrum of society.

516
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:45,083
Now, I want to make sure I
say something about education

517
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:49,020
because you really can't
make long-standing waves

518
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,756
or have a sustained
revolution without educating

519
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:55,861
the next generation of people
who now think in the new ways

520
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,796
and have capabilities
in the new ways.

521
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,198
So a very profoundly
important thing

522
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,900
about biological
engineering here

523
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,704
is it became course
20, the first new MIT

524
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,540
undergraduate
major in 39 years--

525
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,042
entirely new curriculum.

526
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:14,846
Students were rooted in classes
from the biology department

527
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,149
and genetics and biochemistry
and molecular biology.

528
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:21,219
But all the engineering,
analysis, synthesis,

529
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:25,123
measurement, and modeling
is brought to bear purely

530
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:28,793
and solely on the molecular
and genomic biology

531
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:33,164
in an entirely new way that has
never existed at any institution

532
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,199
worldwide.

533
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,101
And now these
students are going on

534
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,169
to become the next
generation who

535
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,772
are addressing these
problems in ways

536
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:43,074
that the physics-based
engineering

537
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,911
and chemistry-based
engineering just don't

538
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:48,346
have the capabilities to do.

539
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:51,816
And so now we can add to the
armament that the world needs.

540
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:57,055
I will note, at MIT,
education is a huge priority.

541
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:03,161
And in fact, I need to spend
happily, unfortunately,

542
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,096
most of my day in
my office having

543
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,599
office hours for my
undergraduate students

544
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,634
who have an exam
tomorrow morning,

545
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:13,538
and they want to discuss the
questions and the problems

546
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:14,506
and the topics.

547
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,207
And to me, that's
a huge priority,

548
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:20,745
as it is for faculty
across the Institute.

549
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,081
So what are the
products of this,

550
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:27,819
along with new types of
ideas and technologies?

551
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:32,090
Of course, not surprisingly,
companies have been spun out.

552
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,861
And I loved Phil's
list and could

553
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:40,398
put biological
engineering-spawned companies

554
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:40,999
alongside.

555
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,367
I'm just going to
note a few that

556
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:45,236
are widely recognized
as preeminent

557
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,538
in their particular fields.

558
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:50,742
So Adimab out of Dane Wittrup's
lab in biologics discovery

559
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:52,444
and engineering.

560
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,247
Synbio out of Linda
Griffith's lab in Oregon

561
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,149
on chip technologies.

562
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:03,722
Pivot Bio from Chris Voigt's lab
in agricultural biotechnologies.

563
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:07,626
Applied BioMath, now part
of Certara in systems

564
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:12,163
pharmacology, from myself
and a number of colleagues.

565
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,899
Also note Strand
Therapeutics at the bottom

566
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:18,837
now bringing synthetic biology
into the realm of engineering

567
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,872
immune cells to
be more effective,

568
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:24,342
again, in a
predictively defined way

569
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:28,546
by Ron Weiss and Darrell Irvine.

570
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:33,451
To end in the last few minutes
in a forward-looking way--

571
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:38,323
but, of course, to look forward,
you say, where are we going?

572
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,758
And, of course,
where you're going

573
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,661
depends on where
you're already rooted.

574
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,430
And so one of the
major things that's

575
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,066
coming out of this
discipline is addressing

576
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:53,371
what I think is one of the
long-standing challenges that

577
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:56,641
has not been addressed
effectively yet.

578
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:00,478
President Kornbluth talked
about the hard, hard, hardest

579
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:01,279
problems.

580
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,481
That's what this is.

581
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:09,621
You all are very well aware
of the attrition in the drug

582
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,756
discovery and
development pipeline,

583
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,959
that a very, very small
fraction of therapeutics

584
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,262
that enter the clinic succeed.

585
00:28:17,262 --> 00:28:19,164
And the biggest
problem of that is

586
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:23,568
that the major costs
of the pipeline

587
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,403
are in the clinical trials.

588
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:28,239
So you're wasting the
vast majority of the money

589
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,841
that you're investing.

590
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,911
So this is a critical problem
that's been around for decades.

591
00:28:32,911 --> 00:28:36,014
And again, people say, well,
we're doing the best we can.

592
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,649
We need to do better.

593
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,017
Society needs it.

594
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,086
So what is at the
root of this problem?

595
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,988
There's multiple
issues, of course.

596
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:48,259
But from our point of view, it's
the very poor translatability

597
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,261
from animal models
to human patients,

598
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:53,898
that one can do very, very,
very effective things in animals

599
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,434
that just don't work in humans.

600
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:59,537
That's what's got
to be improved.

601
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,839
And why is that?

602
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,342
Well, traditional
animal-to-human translation

603
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:08,947
focuses on using
genomics largely

604
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,750
and other quantitative
measurements,

605
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,287
identifying pathways and
processes involved in a disease

606
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:19,290
or lack of response
to a therapeutic that

607
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,728
are observed from very well
controlled animal experiments

608
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,598
and presume that,
if those are what's

609
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,068
most important in the
animals, then if we can find

610
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:32,237
some hint of them in the
humans, they're also going

611
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,339
to be important in the humans.

612
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,907
But this is incorrect.

613
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,243
In the vast majority
of cases, the things

614
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,811
that are most important
in the animals

615
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:42,313
are not what's most
important in the humans.

616
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,416
Therefore, things that
work very well in animals

617
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,418
are not effective in humans.

618
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,454
And this is the
long-standing lament.

619
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,556
Again, you're all familiar
with of curing disease

620
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:55,293
after disease in mice with no
consequent benefit in humans.

621
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,861
I call this the
"tip of the iceberg"

622
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,564
problem because what you're
looking at is what's most

623
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:03,701
important in the animal
with very little guarantee,

624
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:07,906
and, in fact, very minor chance,
that it's actually what's also

625
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,542
most important for
the human patients.

626
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,544
How do you address that?

627
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,879
Well, this is where
the combination

628
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:19,350
of biology and engineering
inherent in this new discipline

629
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,121
really holds a lot of promise,
that if you understand,

630
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:26,157
on the one hand, what
these biological pathways

631
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,027
and processes are, what
the data represent,

632
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,229
and, on the other
hand, you're capable

633
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:35,333
of the sophisticated
computational analysis

634
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,535
and modeling-- one
can bring together,

635
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,672
for instance in the
example I'm showing here,

636
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:45,176
using a semi-supervised AI
machine-learning approach

637
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,346
in which the secret sauce
is not the sophistication

638
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:51,749
of the computation, but it's
the understanding of how

639
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:56,254
the data map and what the data
mean biologically-- then you

640
00:30:56,254 --> 00:31:00,658
can find pathways and
processes that are, in fact,

641
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:03,561
most important for
humans even when

642
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:07,432
they seem to be of negligible
importance in the animals.

643
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:12,036
So I call this, instead of
being focused on the tip,

644
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,206
you can actually find the
iceberg underneath that's

645
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,443
most important for the human
by this combination of omics

646
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:22,046
data, understanding biological
pathways and processes,

647
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,550
and the computational
machine learning.

648
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,219
These are projects we've
been pursuing not only

649
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,588
with a number of the biopharma
companies in this area

650
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:33,491
and elsewhere, but the
Department of Defense, the Gates

651
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:38,296
Foundation for vaccines, and,
not surprisingly, the FDA,

652
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:41,900
which wants to improve this
and the methodology for this

653
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,834
strongly.

654
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:46,204
Some examples have to do
with Humira resistance

655
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:50,508
in Crohn's and colitis with
a very well known biopharma

656
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,411
company, with the Army--
protection against

657
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,446
neurocognitive trauma--

658
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:56,881
and I can name others.

659
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,150
And most importantly,
this approach

660
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:02,687
is now being adopted into
industry therapeutics pipelines.

661
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,490
And so I believe that we will
see, over the coming decade

662
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:11,262
or so, significantly
improved translatability

663
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,332
from the preclinical
studies to clinical.

664
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,501
So that's just an
example of rooter

665
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,903
where we are now in
biological engineering,

666
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,705
looking at the kind
of challenge that

667
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:26,477
has been too hard to do before
but is no longer too hard.

668
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,579
With that, I thank you
for your attention.

669
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:32,150
I thank you for being here
at this momentous event.

670
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:36,821
And it's a great pleasure to
introduce our next speaker, Ruth

671
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,791
Lehmann, who's a professor
in biology and director

672
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,459
of the Whitehead Institute.

673
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:44,395
[APPLAUSE]

674
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:50,268

675
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,469
Hello, good morning.

676
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,771
It's a real pleasure
for me to be here today

677
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:55,807
and to celebrate HEALS.

678
00:32:55,807 --> 00:33:00,411
Like Sally, I am also
a recent recruit.

679
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:05,616
And I also have to say that
it is just invigorating

680
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:08,019
and empowering to
be in an environment

681
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:13,157
where the University is without
limits and the environment,

682
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,728
the ecosystem of Kendall
Square could not be better,

683
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:21,833
and the hospitals
across the river

684
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,802
give us really an
opportunity to think big.

685
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,505
What I want to tell you
about is a little bit

686
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,641
about the Whitehead Institute.

687
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,544
And I'm calling it a
radical experiment.

688
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,079
This is actually
a title of a book

689
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,081
about the history of
the Whitehead Institute

690
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,883
that Gerry Fink just completed.

691
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:42,620
And at the beginning, when the
Whitehead Institute was founded,

692
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,556
it was clearly a
radical experiment,

693
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:52,864
and it wasn't always taken with
total positivity, let's say,

694
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:58,336
because it was a bold approach
having an Institute which

695
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,506
was independent in its
research, government,

696
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:05,710
and finance, solely associated
with an institution,

697
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,480
with MIT, where all the
faculty are teaching at MIT

698
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,550
and are in departments at MIT.

699
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,253
The founding vision
was very bold, as

700
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:19,257
bold as MIT is, to assemble
the best scientific talent,

701
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:23,061
to catalyze their
work with support,

702
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,431
and to encourage them
to go their own ways.

703
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,032
There were many
early breakthroughs.

704
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,201
And actually, you heard
about quite a few.

705
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,171
You heard several times
about the breakthrough work

706
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:34,806
of Bob Weinberg.

707
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,542
And that was at the
Whitehead Institute

708
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:41,179
in the field of cancer,
work in STEM cell biology,

709
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,848
transcription, and other fields.

710
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:47,051
In particular-- and again,
you heard this already--

711
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,420
one third of the
human genome was

712
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,623
sequenced at the Whitehead
Institute in collaboration

713
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,358
with the NIH and MIT.

714
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:57,161
And that led then,
by Eric Lander,

715
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:00,264
starting the Broad
Institute as a spin-out.

716
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:04,402
What's also really important is
shaping a new generation, not

717
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:07,071
just as teachers, but also
the Whitehead Institute

718
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:12,376
established the Fellows
Program for newly minted PhDs.

719
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:16,080
And the first notable Fellows
are David Page and Eric Lander,

720
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,351
and others are George Daley,
Angelika Amon, and Peter Kim,

721
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:23,855
and also David Bartel,
who was mentioned earlier.

722
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,557
So what are we about today?

723
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,493
Today, we are 18 members--

724
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,761
14 of them are tenured.

725
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,630
And we have six Fellows.

726
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,134
And we have a large number
of graduate students

727
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:41,772
and undergraduates and postdocs
working in our laboratories.

728
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:46,511
And probably, one would say
from just the recognition,

729
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,946
the experiment was a success.

730
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,649
But it's still an
experiment as I see it.

731
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,951
So what are we looking for?

732
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,987
And when I speak here
about the Whitehead,

733
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,689
I think I speak about biology.

734
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,058
I speak about basic sciences.

735
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:04,996
We really, today, want to
understand how organisms

736
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:09,000
perform their tasks in life.

737
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,103
And that is to encapture
the complexity.

738
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:16,140
We believe that that
has to be achieved

739
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,977
by a mechanistic
understanding-- as we heard

740
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,380
Phil Sharp saying, measuring.

741
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,749
We want to understand
it mechanistically.

742
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:29,220
But then we do want to
deconstruct and reconstruct

743
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,123
to really understand
complexity of life.

744
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:37,361
And that can be done only
by collaborative work.

745
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:40,665
And that is to draw from
biology, physics, chemistry,

746
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:43,100
engineering, and
increasingly computer

747
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:51,676
science, AI, and machine
learning to develop new tools

748
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,844
and designs.

749
00:36:53,844 --> 00:37:00,284
In general, we don't want to be
afraid of asking any questions.

750
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:03,120
We don't want to be afraid
to change directions

751
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,488
if that is important.

752
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:06,691
And I think HEALS
will empower that

753
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:10,261
through the collaborations
that will spark new ideas

754
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:13,831
and new points of inflection.

755
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:18,402
So two points, when we
think about history,

756
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,971
we can jump at today.

757
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:23,441
We can analyze cells now
at a level of resolution,

758
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:28,079
and we can ask and model
cells in a way, that

759
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,683
was unforeseen before, leading
to a project spearheaded

760
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:37,989
by Jonathan Weissman, and also
with the work of Ian Cheeseman,

761
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,157
to describe actually
a virtual cell,

762
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:43,561
to know every component,
every aspect of what

763
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,862
is happening in a cell.

764
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:47,798
But going one step
further, how can we

765
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:49,600
understand a whole organism?

766
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,369
How do we understand the parts?

767
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:54,372
How do we bring neurobiology
and immunology together

768
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:57,908
to understand how an
organism actually functions,

769
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:02,146
how it feels an infection?

770
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:07,018
So these projects are
supported by some initiatives.

771
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:12,189
And these initiatives, they're
trying to be very bold.

772
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:16,260
And they're trying to really
address some of the pressing

773
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,731
issues of today's challenges.

774
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:24,001
So the Whitehead Initiative of
Biology, Health, and Climate

775
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,337
Change addresses
questions directly

776
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,073
of agricultural
questions in terms

777
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,976
of drought-resistant
seeds, but also,

778
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,978
how does temperature
affect the cell?

779
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,247
How does a cell work at
different temperatures?

780
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,282
And you will hear later
in the next session

781
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:42,620
from Sinisa Hrvatin
about hibernation.

782
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,458
The Women's Health Initiative
brings fundamental science

783
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:50,127
together with
really understanding

784
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,529
why is there a health bias.

785
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:53,731
And I'll talk to you a
little bit later about this.

786
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:57,902
And all of this could
not be possible,

787
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:01,806
grasping this
complexity, without using

788
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:07,011
AI approaches to lead the way
but also to be led by the data

789
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,080
that we are accumulating.

790
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,515
We are not alone.

791
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,018
I always see the Whitehead
a little bit as a hub.

792
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,020
We have lots and lots of spokes.

793
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,657
Many of those spokes go
across the street to MIT.

794
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:25,529
But also, we have lots of
interactions with hospitals

795
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,565
and other universities.

796
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:32,169
We seek out collaborations,
and collaborators seek us out.

797
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,338
So today what I
want to talk to you

798
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:37,975
is actually give you five quick
vignettes about some science.

799
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:41,846
And they're pretty much
all going on right now.

800
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:45,449
These vignettes are also
highlighting how we're perhaps

801
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:49,787
addressing, somehow, Doug's
criticism to basic science

802
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,757
that we're doing this all in
model organisms because, as you

803
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,292
can see, much of what
we're learning here

804
00:39:55,292 --> 00:40:00,231
is directly either applied
to humans, in humans, or not

805
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,099
in humans but in plants.

806
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:08,172
And so I will be talking about
these five challenges in biology

807
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:11,308
and actually for human
health and the planet.

808
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:14,078
And so let's jump into it.

809
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,380
First, I'm going to talk to
you about the Lourido lab.

810
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,449
The Lourido lab
works on Toxoplasma.

811
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:22,386
And many of you know how
dangerous Toxoplasma can be,

812
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:25,156
as it infects a large
percentage of the population

813
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:28,259
and can have really
serious consequences

814
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,663
for pregnant women, infants,
and immunocompromised people.

815
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:38,469
So what Sebastian and his group
have done is they took all

816
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:43,974
the 8,000 genes of Toxoplasma
and made gRNAs against them

817
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:47,511
so that he can interfere with
those RNAs and then infect

818
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:50,948
the organism where normally
the infection occurs.

819
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:54,652
And then they're able
to use different tissues

820
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:58,255
and different-- and look
at what of these cells

821
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,457
are now surviving.

822
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,592
Those cells which are
surviving are obviously

823
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:06,330
not the ones whose genes are
required for the function.

824
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,333
And so he can directly
select with this whole genome

825
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:13,070
mutagenesis for genes which
affect fitness and has

826
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,239
identified a number
of genes which affect

827
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,975
the fitness of the infection.

828
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,611
And this is clear
how it's directly

829
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,246
applicable in the future.

830
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:26,283
The next, we go to another
challenging problem.

831
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:31,622
And that is, how do we make
better drought-resistant plants?

832
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:36,060
How can we deal with the
issue of food supply?

833
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,630
And so what most of you know
is that many seeds are actually

834
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,901
produced by crossing
different parent plants.

835
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:47,571
And then the seed itself is much
better than the parents were.

836
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,440
The problem is that
those seeds can not

837
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,243
be propagated continuously.

838
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,945
And so if they're
just grown, then there

839
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:56,514
will be a large variety.

840
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,750
So what Mary Gehring
is addressing

841
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,652
is to ask the
question of, could we

842
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:04,989
actually make seeds which
can be asexually propagated?

843
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:08,025
And that actually happens
sometimes naturally.

844
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,929
And so she is using these
kinds of seeds which sometimes

845
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:15,699
make that mistake of not needing
fertilization to find out

846
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,701
what factors are required.

847
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:22,506
And then can we up the
opportunity for seeds

848
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:29,580
to develop asexually and
then produce populations

849
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,684
of seeds that can actually
be used without having

850
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,954
the hybrid-vigor problem?

851
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:41,458
The next question is going
directly to human biology.

852
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,929
And that is addressed
by David Page.

853
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:51,001
His lab really is puzzled by
this striking and still very

854
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:56,507
unexplained sex bias in the
prevalence, the severity

855
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,677
of diseases between
males and females,

856
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:03,380
also, certainly,
drug sensitivity.

857
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:09,386
And so what they found is really
surprising and very interesting.

858
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:13,390
So when we just look at
all the cells in our soma,

859
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:18,562
in our body, not the cells
in our reproductive organs,

860
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:21,532
there are two types of
chromosomes, sex chromosomes,

861
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,968
the X and the Y.
And when we look

862
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:28,505
at the expression of the
active X chromosome in males

863
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:35,946
or females, so XX
versus XY people,

864
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,449
the active X is
expressed the same way.

865
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,951
So all the genes are--
there's no sex difference.

866
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,088
But the sex differences
come from the genes which

867
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:47,891
are expressed on the so-called
inactive X, which is actually

868
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:56,967
not inactive but expresses 38%
of the genes on the active X.

869
00:43:56,967 --> 00:44:00,371
And also, there are genes
expressed on the Y chromosome.

870
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:04,908
And these could really influence
the expression of these genes

871
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:09,179
are making a cell different,
any cell in the body different,

872
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:13,083
whether it is in an XX
organism or an XY organism.

873
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:19,089
And so the idea is that this
can have an influence on disease

874
00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:22,860
prevalence and sex bias.

875
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:27,231
The next issue is
another big question.

876
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:30,567
And that's the big question
of neurodegeneration.

877
00:44:30,567 --> 00:44:34,705
And there is so little
that we know at this point

878
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:38,409
where we can really do something
about neurodegeneration.

879
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,678
A particular type
of neurodegeneration

880
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:45,215
is neurodegeneration
caused by prion disease.

881
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:50,621
Prion disease is usually a
very swift neurodegeneration.

882
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,290
And the death is due
to the accumulation

883
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:57,494
of misshapen proteins.

884
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:00,130
And so Jonathan
Weissman designed

885
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,769
CHARM, which is where a
fusion protein recruits

886
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:09,873
a methyltransferase specifically
through a DNA-binding domain

887
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,575
to a specific gene.

888
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:19,183
And by that, it methylates that
gene and silences that gene.

889
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:21,985
And so this can be
delivered into the brain.

890
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:26,090
And in mice, this reduces 80%
of the prion-gene expression.

891
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:30,661
And mice, which are
affected by prion disease,

892
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,564
live longer after
this injection.

893
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,699
And so my final
vignette is perhaps

894
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:39,803
the most biggest
challenge in human health,

895
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:42,206
and that is chronic disease.

896
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,241
There are many types
of chronic diseases.

897
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,076
And the problem with
chronic diseases

898
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:49,179
is they're not due
to a single gene.

899
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,915
So we cannot start
with a single gene.

900
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,418
But they have
multifactorial causes.

901
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,254
And we don't even exactly
know what the causes are.

902
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,223
So what Rick Young
and his colleagues

903
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:06,296
found is that often through
elevated oxidative environment,

904
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:12,703
through the pathogenic factors,
proteins are less mobile.

905
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:17,574
They are less mobile because
their cysteines are altered

906
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:20,344
so that they are now
interacting with other proteins

907
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:23,480
more through
cysteine-cysteine bridges.

908
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,417
And he phrases this
as proteolethargy.

909
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:30,654
And this proteolethargy
may, first of all,

910
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:34,057
lead to reduced
function and output.

911
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:37,928
And they showed this very
clearly with insulin receptor

912
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:40,864
mobility being reduced.

913
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:45,235
And it is also a target
which can actually be

914
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,304
more globally and widely used.

915
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:51,308
So I hope that with these
vignettes that I just presented,

916
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:55,412
you got an idea of where
basic science meets

917
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:56,847
translational science.

918
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:59,650
And that couldn't be
more better illustrated

919
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,486
than the many companies
which have sprung out

920
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:06,757
of these initiatives that
have started at the Whitehead

921
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:07,624
Institute.

922
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,626
I'm really looking
forward for HEALS

923
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:14,364
to further enlarge the
interactions that we have.

924
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:19,570
And I think the
possibilities for science,

925
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:23,140
both at the mechanistic
level and understanding

926
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,709
the complexity for
health and the planet,

927
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,845
is really, really great.

928
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,246
And I look forward to that.

929
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:30,347
Thank you very much.

930
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,383
[APPLAUSE]

931
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:34,852
