1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,640
how many of you and raise your hand is

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,640
somehow familiar with this

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,799
map okay for the few hands not raised

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,000
let me explain this to you this is Trump

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,080
winning

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,680
okay at a higher resolution if you zoom

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,119
in this is somehow different you notice

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,720
that the blue dots which are the big

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,480
cities in the US are very different from

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,160
the previous map you see that in in

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,520
cities uh there is a prevalence of blue

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,160
which is not

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,480
Trump and we know that cities has grown

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,760
has born uh more than 10,000 years ago

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,320
because people wanted to get to live

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,600
together to

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,039
exchange experiences to exchange ideas

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,719
to exchange chromosomes and this is

19
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,160
basically the birth of of cities we know

20
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,080
today that cities behave somehow in a

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,560
different way in a special way well

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,080
fortunately we can study today's cities

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,520
with the help of digital Technologies

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:17,200
this is Lisbon seeing in real time from

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:19,600
the lens of data produced by the public

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,720
transportation we are lab here at MIT

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,479
we're not interested in politics we are

28
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,600
interested in science and the science of

29
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,439
City we are the sensible City lab we use

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,880
technology to better

31
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,840
understand what are the rules of cities

32
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,200
how we can converge the digital world

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,640
that we live in with the physical world

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,000
that we live in and we do this all over

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,040
the world with many companies with many

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
cities and with few research Partners so

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,079
let me give you some examples of our

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,240
research today for example something

39
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,039
very peculiar that we find in cities is

40
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,119
that there are a lot of environmental

41
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,479
information that change in space and in

42
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,079
time take pollution for

43
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,600
example you have a very good air quality

44
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:10,119
in this point of the city you go down

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,200
the block go around the corner and you

46
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,599
have a very bad air pollution and air

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,800
quality this is normal it's how cities

48
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,560
behave well how to monitor this we

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,480
decided to build our own sensors and

50
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:28,080
instead of deploying them every meter in

51
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:31,160
our cities we equip some cars so that

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,920
normal cars can bring around sensors and

53
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,120
those are multi-purpose multiplatform

54
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,560
sensors they're equipped with cameras

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,920
you can take pictures you can take

56
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,680
thermal pictures and multispectral

57
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:50,760
pictures you can have readings on

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:54,280
temperature and humidity and again air

59
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,440
quality and um why is this useful this

60
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,319
is useful for example to build these

61
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,879
kind of

62
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:04,720
maps this is a way of democratizing data

63
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:07,080
you show to Citizens and to companies

64
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,599
and to municipalities data at

65
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,560
everybody's doorstep what's the air

66
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,280
quality in front of your house in front

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,360
of your kids

68
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,120
school it's interesting that if you

69
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,239
bring this technology to different

70
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,319
cities or you show it to different

71
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,640
companies everybody find somehow their

72
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,680
own value in New York we were working

73
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,599
with the mayor and with the municipality

74
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,760
to look at how the underprivileged

75
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,000
communities the lower income communities

76
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,120
are disp disproportionately exposed to

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,319
better air quality if you go to

78
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Stockholm they were interested in heat

79
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:46,560
waves and understand how the heat

80
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,480
bubbles in the city are

81
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,280
created I'll show you something that

82
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:55,159
we're doing in Rome and we're monitoring

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,760
trees Rome today has a big problem of

84
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:00,439
tree Health there are small parasites

85
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,159
that really like to eat those trees

86
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:05,879
and those very beautiful sentennial

87
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,200
trees are are dying so we're using the

88
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,159
same technology attached to cars with

89
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,120
few different sensors normal camera

90
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,799
multispectral camera with some AI to be

91
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,639
able to detect the

92
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,079
tree and understand how the three is

93
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,440
performing

94
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,080
photosynthesis and we're doing this with

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,960
the forest corpse in Italy the the

96
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,960
Carabiner so we're equipping their cars

97
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,840
with our sensors collecting a lot of

98
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,320
data and and then eventually down the

99
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,039
line they're going to use satellite

100
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,400
pictures as well to to complement the

101
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:42,560
view that we have from down from Road

102
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,199
level but talking about trees uh let me

103
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,000
give you this number

104
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,199
65% of insects are at risk of Extinction

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,160
due to climate

106
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,759
change this is quite dramatic it's quite

107
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,759
dramatic because it means that all the

108
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:00,840
ecosystems that basically rule the world

109
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,199
are at the edge of collapse

110
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,560
and ecosystems in cities are even more

111
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:10,240
fragile and those little bugs um even if

112
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,960
they're very annoying for you and for me

113
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,880
as well there a very good proxy of the

114
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,080
biodiversity of a city or an environment

115
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,000
counting these bucks is crucial to

116
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,960
understand at which point our ecosystem

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
is going up or down well it turns out

118
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,520
that all this counting are happening

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,759
manually there are people going there

120
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,400
with a notebook noting the bugs there is

121
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,319
very very little AI on this so in our

122
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,759
lab we said let's try to not only

123
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,800
recognize automatically there is an

124
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,440
insect in this picture but we built a

125
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,160
platform we built a library noce library

126
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,440
that is able to categorize the insect PC

127
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,479
and this may sound very you know trivial

128
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,919
or a computer science exercise but then

129
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:59,360
we talked with some companies with um

130
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,280
with an engineering and architecture

131
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,000
company

132
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,639
and they were saying well we actually

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,479
need to monitor the biodiversity in oral

134
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,120
de developments and uh and and projects

135
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,400
so why don't you develop something more

136
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,560
so we decided to embed this intelligence

137
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,440
in a sensor and build together with some

138
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,360
experts in

139
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:24,080
biology some Gardens some physical

140
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,479
Gardens with the right mix of trees and

141
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,160
flowers to attract these insects and do

142
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,919
the counting

143
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,680
automatically there's a some of the

144
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,720
research that we do we we partner with

145
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,479
many companies all over the world with

146
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,840
many cities in three of them the one

147
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,240
that you see in the map Dubai Amsterdam

148
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,919
Ando de Janeiro we actually build some

149
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,000
MIT Labs so we have permanent MIT

150
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,639
researchers there to really create an

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,240
ecosystem of innovation together with

152
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,599
the local stakeholders in Amsterdam for

153
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,280
example we're working on self-driving

154
00:06:54,599 --> 00:07:00,479
boats we call them robots because they

155
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,840
are robotic boats

156
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,440
this is a long project that we are

157
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,680
developing with them you see here some

158
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,080
some of the true videos uh if you go to

159
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,759
Amsterdam you can try some of them and

160
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,440
not only they are autonomous for people

161
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,680
but with the same kind of Technology you

162
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,319
can use you can address other City needs

163
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,440
like trash collection for example the

164
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,560
challenge here was really to design the

165
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,560
technology for enabling a urban boat to

166
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,440
go around to design it and to understand

167
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,120
what are the urban uses for this and

168
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,520
we've done everything from the hardware

169
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,599
to the software to the urban cases if

170
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,560
you go to Rio De Janeiro for example

171
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,199
we're interested in this kind of

172
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,639
environments

173
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,520
FAS the shanki

174
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,639
towns a town that has grown without

175
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,639
rules and that's a result well many of

176
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,319
the planning techniques here are failing

177
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,479
Amazon doesn't deliver here why because

178
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,039
there are no street address there is no

179
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,919
catas

180
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:06,479
so we're using new technologies we were

181
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:09,039
the first ones to create 3D maps with

182
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,199
lighter or these

183
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,879
environments and this is the base for a

184
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,840
digital twin of a

185
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:20,360
fava that eventually enables us to you

186
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,720
know give property titles to people

187
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,680
understand what's the airf flow

188
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,919
understand what's the risk of

189
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,560
TB and plan for surgical interventions

190
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:31,440
instead of just demolishing everything

191
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,279
like many politicians are are claiming

192
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,000
for so those are some of the research

193
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:40,479
that we are doing here at the lab we are

194
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,680
lucky enough to do together with ILP our

195
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,760
big conference our annual Flagship

196
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,240
Conference of the lab here on campus

197
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,160
happening tomorrow it's called being

198
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,880
physical because we this year we're

199
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,399
really going to explore how the physical

200
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,279
proximity of people in cities are

201
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,120
fostering for a more resilient
