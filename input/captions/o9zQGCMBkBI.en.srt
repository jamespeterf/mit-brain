1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,400
It's my pleasure now to welcome Dr.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,960
Deni, Dr. Deni Bodto, co-founder and CEO

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,200
at Muan Vision. So, Muan Vision uses

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,440
cosmic ray muan tomography to

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,320
non-invasively x-ray mining assets,

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,800
enabling real time surface fluid and

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,199
density monitoring for safer and more

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,640
efficient mineral discovery.

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,640
>> Here we are. Thank you, Thricia, and

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
thank you, Eduardo. And hello, everyone.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,279
My name is Tanky BTO. I'm the CEO and

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,519
co-founder of M Vision. Previously I was

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,880
an MIAT scientist and I've also worked

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,520
in oil and gas exploration for 15 years.

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,920
Mining metals is key to our future. Yet

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,000
the industry squeeze between massive

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,000
increased demand and chronically low or

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,399
grades. That means that much more earth

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,559
needs to be moved mined and much more

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,120
energy water consumed to process the

21
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,120
same one ton of copper. Mu vision wants

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,640
to break this cycle. Our mission is to

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,480
boost efficiency, safety and

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,800
sustainability of critical minerals

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,399
processing while supporting the industry

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,000
transformation towards digital

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,760
operations.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,360
I will pick as an example the heat

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,880
leaching process which today is a

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,439
hundred billion dollar industry and

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,920
accounts for 20% of worldwide copper and

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,920
other metals. Heap leeching is the

33
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,320
preferred solution for lowgrade ores

34
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,880
that are expected to soon be a primary

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,119
source of new copper. In heat leaching,

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,840
minor is crushed and then stacked into

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,000
huge piles which are then irrigated with

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,080
an acid containing solution that ideally

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,400
distributes uniformly dissolving the

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,560
metal containing the mineral grains and

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,400
being collected at the bottom. In

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,640
practice, there are many reasons why

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,960
moisture across the leeching acid is not

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,960
uniform. This leads to two problems.

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,439
volumes with too little fluid will

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,280
produce less metal and volumes where too

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,000
much fluid has accumulated may trigger

48
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,079
potentially catastrophic landslide. So

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,640
the question is ultimately how much

50
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,560
moisture and where is it you have inside

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,720
a leeching heap. But how can you

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,200
quantitatively and accurately measure

53
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,600
that? Uh this is an important question I

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,040
believe for any implementation of any AI

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,360
or machine learning uh um uh solution as

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,759
you heard from Brian before. After all,

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,760
most sensors still provide pointlike

58
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,840
information which in this case will be

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,680
completely insufficient and even the

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,520
most advanced X-ray or geophysical

61
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,560
probes only measured at across a few

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,080
inches at best. So what is our solution

63
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,720
to this problem?

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,760
>> In the last few decades, scientists have

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,280
finally been able to look inside ancient

66
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,840
pyramids and volcanoes. Muon Vision is

67
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,560
now using that same technology to

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,879
revolutionize mining. The breakthrough

69
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,840
behind this revolution, muon

70
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,959
radiographic imaging, also known as

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,959
murography. Muons are subatomic

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,440
particles naturally formed when

73
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,760
radiation from distant supernova

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,959
explosions collide with the Earth's

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,360
atmosphere. Muons constantly penetrate

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,640
every square meter on the surface of the

77
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,040
Earth.

78
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,920
At Muon Vision, we've developed a

79
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,400
subterranean technology capable of

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,959
detecting and recording muons as they

81
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,400
travel deep underground. We then use

82
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,640
that data to create 3D density maps of

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,840
large above ground structures like

84
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,319
tailings dams and leech piles. In a

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,200
mineral leech pile, for example, Muon

86
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,840
Vision's technology can identify dry,

87
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,159
low density areas where leeching fluid

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,080
isn't reaching. When operators can see

89
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,319
this issue, they have the chance to

90
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,159
adjust their processing and prevent

91
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,480
hundreds of millions of dollars in

92
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,879
assets from being left behind. In

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,280
tailings dams, the same technology can

94
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,440
also precisely determine the static

95
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,000
vertical stresses on the material as

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,560
well as friatic levels, thus validating

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,280
the dam design and helping increase its

98
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,920
performance. When you see deeper, you

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,720
can work smarter. Muon detection

100
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,200
empowers you to look inside mining's

101
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,319
largest structures and optimize for

102
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,879
efficiency, profitability, and safety.

103
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,599
See deeper with Muon vision

104
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,680
in the

105
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,920
>> Okay, thank you. So, our solution is

106
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,000
ultimately a nuclear imaging detector

107
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,160
and is analogous to take a diagnostic

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,639
X-ray over an unprecedented large

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,400
distance scale. This allows us to scan

110
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,960
inside these high-v value assets in

111
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,680
order to identify, locate, and quantify

112
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,600
underperforming volumes or regions. And

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,120
with that information, we can then

114
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,120
recommend practical and already

115
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,360
available remedial strategies. After

116
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,240
all, you can't manage what you don't

117
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,000
measure. Our diagnostic surveys can

118
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,919
generate value in numerous ways in

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,080
leeching operations. Primarily by

120
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,720
significantly boosting metal recovery

121
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,639
via optimized digital operations as well

122
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,880
as identify secondary leeching

123
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,600
opportunities. Equally important, more

124
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,400
precise leeching is also less costly and

125
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,000
can optimize cars water budget. Finally,

126
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,199
our service helps manage multi

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,440
catastrophic slope stability and reduce

128
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,320
unnecessary uh the risk of unnecessary

129
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,320
personal exposure. I want to conclude by

130
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,479
showing you an example of our technology

131
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,960
at work. So think of a leeching heap in

132
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,039
its initial state as a dry sponge and

133
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,440
our density measurement as a balance

134
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,320
scale that is inserted under the heap.

135
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,000
Now add fluid. Now this displays the air

136
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,600
and increases the bug density of the

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,440
material. Something we do measure

138
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,039
accurately by observing the

139
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,680
corresponding decrease in the immune

140
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,919
flux during this transient phase. But

141
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,479
now look at what happens after the first

142
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,400
100 hours. Although the irrigation rate

143
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,560
is the same, the heap has now lost

144
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,240
weight and has settled into an

145
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,720
equilibrium where you have considerably

146
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,080
less moisture than planned. Why? While a

147
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,000
simple explanation because the high

148
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,000
irrigation rate has caused preferential

149
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,080
flow channels. In other words, the fluid

150
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,320
escapes more quickly and less metal will

151
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,000
be produced. This is a well-known and

152
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,919
hard to predict problem and something

153
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,400
you simply cannot look by just looking

154
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,720
at the heat from the outside.

155
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,639
To conclude, we have developed a new

156
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,479
applications for neon radiography, a

157
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,560
well-known niche technologies. This has

158
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,319
allowed us to build a unique patent mode

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,080
around its many high value potential

160
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,919
applications. We are seeking

161
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,759
collaborations and partnerships across

162
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,479
industries to advance high value use

163
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,759
cases and commercialize our solutions to

164
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,440
long intractable problems. Thank you.

165
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,720
>> Excellent. Thank you so much. We do have

166
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,960
a few questions and a minute or two to

167
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,520
um for you to to elicit your response.

168
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,280
So you mentioned tailing dams. Can you

169
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,600
briefly illustrate how your technology

170
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,639
adds value in this case?

171
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,280
>> Yes. Uh we pl I think I'm still sharing.

172
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,120
Uh essentially the value that we will

173
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,120
bring teley dimes first of all it's a

174
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,199
well-known issue in the in the mineral

175
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,000
processing industry and you know as left

176
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,919
horrible legacies around the world. How

177
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
we bring value? Well consider what is

178
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,280
the state-ofthe-art today for analyzing

179
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,360
tailing times. In the best case

180
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,600
scenario, lowc cost technologies like

181
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,319
taking a sample which typically is not

182
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,319
deep enough are used and the next sample

183
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,080
may be several hundred meters away and

184
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,000
this is very hard to understand what's

185
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,880
going to happen to something which is

186
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,800
large dimension by by definition. So the

187
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,280
value we bring is to validate these

188
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,479
asset models measuring key properties

189
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,479
like stress as well as moisture content

190
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,199
as well as density non-uniformities

191
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,960
which are not expected uh to be there in

192
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,720
the first place and of course provide

193
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,800
long-term monitor.

194
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,479
>> Excellent. Thank you. And and quickly

195
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,199
the last uh question are there other

196
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:32,400
applications for moan radiograph um

197
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,160
outside what you have discussed today?

198
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,720
uh there are we believe of course

199
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,120
murography is a passive technology so

200
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,960
it's difficult for us to accelerate it

201
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,680
most applications fall in the mining

202
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,759
space we have built a patent portfolio

203
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,440
on slope stability and leeching heaps

204
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,120
but there are classical applications

205
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,199
like void detection and mineral

206
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,599
exploration which are accessible to

207
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,639
everyone as well as we believe novel

208
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,360
applications in mining plants uh similar

209
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,280
heavy industries are likely to have uh

210
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,080
uh potential applications as well. Thank

211
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,080
you.

212
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,440
>> Excellent. Well, thank you so much. It

213
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,160
was such a pleasure. Incredible

214
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,160
presentation.
