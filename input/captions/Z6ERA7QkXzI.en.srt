1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,839
uh in the US yes uh but aru it's

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,400
temporarily only in the sense that the

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,160
grow is linear rather than really show

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,599
up only in that sense it's stalling the

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,000
actra number is actually growing still

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,439
right uh but in China not at all yeah

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,720
later will show some number where EV I

8
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:26,920
would say really matured instead of

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,160
stalling uh and then the last thing is

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,239
the US One the stalling has to be

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,719
temporary unless us really just want to

12
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,239
cut itself entirely from the global

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,200
context here right so that's my short

14
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,120
answer to the question uh let me give

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,360
you some specific numbers um this in

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,239
2023 first of all when I say electric

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,960
vehicle here uh I mean pure battery

18
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,160
electric vehicle plus this plug uh

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,719
plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that's

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,160
what I mean there a two type of that

21
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:00,960
right by the way who owns one of

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:04,479
this interesting that's about six so

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:09,880
seven about about 10% about

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:12,080
10% uh that's the US average actually uh

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,159
the sales in terms only yeah in the same

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,000
not not the stock but 10% right that's

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,720
interesting uh another thing so who how

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,600
many have been to

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,880
China about half okay yeah so just get

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,360
some context here right so that's us and

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,479
China China sending 8 million so

32
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,759
absolute number way better but what's

33
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,040
important the following

34
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,600
uh if you look at the year- on-year

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,960
growth in

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:40,960
2023 both country grow by 30 to

37
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:45,040
40% right the momentum was very nice

38
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:49,880
this right uh but what happens in

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:53,079
2024 uh even last like fourth quarter of

40
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,479
2023 uh the US side start to slow down

41
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,680
quite a bit while China is keep growing

42
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:02,600
that that's where the Divergence uh

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,200
happens here right um here uh buou our

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,679
associ direct research to prepared these

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,319
slides moment ago U it triy to show that

46
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,440
the notion of stalling is only in the

47
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,920
sense that is a linear growth yeah

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,400
that's is that that's the number you can

49
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,000
see there uh here it's still absolute

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,360
number is still growing up this right

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,640
but the thing is when a new technology

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,040
comes in you want this linear growth at

53
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,599
the beginning but at some point you want

54
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,599
to shoot up right the and then you saty

55
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,760
this is the S curve right the sense of

56
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:38,360
stalling is we haven't seen the S curve

57
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:42,599
part this tipping up part

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,599
yet uh so this is the market share that

59
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,080
I was talk about uh I compare the two

60
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:51,400
country in the two the few years right

61
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,560
China went from uh 6% 16% 29% 30% and

62
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,239
this year just reached half so more than

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,519
half of the people actually buying

64
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,120
electric vehicle that right later

65
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,280
explain what's behind that but us

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,280
remains at 9 to 10% level here as this

67
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,280
audience actually represent right about

68
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,720
10% people actually have a BV or pluging

69
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,840
hybrid electric

70
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,640
vehicle so why this thing matters right

71
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,640
if you're familiar with this uh diffus

72
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:25,360
Innovation uh there's one Theory called

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,440
this uh the chasm right uh we said that

74
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,360
in this

75
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,400
part that can be easy you get this few

76
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,319
minor of this enthusiastic right I care

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,159
about enough about the new technology

78
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,760
it's cool I care about the climate it's

79
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,959
important so I'll do that right but when

80
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,360
you cross this one that's where often

81
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,519
many company die and many industry do

82
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,840
not

83
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:53,920
mature and using this graph you can see

84
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,439
that uh uh us is struggling 10% is about

85
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,720
still somewhere here but China has

86
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,720
crossed that chasm

87
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,439
that's the major difference uh and also

88
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,599
let me talk about the the motivation

89
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,760
when you are here again it's a novelty

90
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,439
it's your environmental attitude is you

91
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,519
want to show to be doing the right thing

92
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,919
to be cool but when you move here to

93
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,720
here those things no longer matters in a

94
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,320
way because the mass public they care

95
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,840
about what they care about cost care

96
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,919
about convenience right that this this

97
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,759
where fundamental St matter let me

98
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,759
explain to you why uh in this Regard in

99
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,840
terms of crossing the this major chm US

100
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,919
is not ready

101
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,960
yet the first thing is price mention

102
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,520
this this basic microeconomics one why

103
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,560
right if you look at the US ongoing

104
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,000
price uh this is IC and this is the

105
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,240
electric vehicle it's still much more

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,639
expensive that's a very simple thing uh

107
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,520
you cannot convince average America to

108
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,639
pay $10,000 more because oh I care about

109
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,639
the

110
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,000
environment so when it come down to this

111
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,039
Crossing that critical candom is the

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,400
fundamental pricing comen in that

113
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:15,840
matters right uh in contrast in China

114
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:18,319
last year 60% of EV are cheaper than

115
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,240
their IC

116
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,639
equivalent right so therefore the result

117
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,400
is not surprising purely in economics

118
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:30,240
they are cheaper that and and this is

119
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:33,919
very important also this happened while

120
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,360
China removed the national subsidy for

121
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,360
Ev

122
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,160
purchases there's another Point often

123
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,160
talk about is oh China have a lot of

124
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,759
government subsidy the ETC which is true

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,880
well we'll talk a little about but last

126
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,560
year this number is people still buying

127
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,240
electric vehicle on for its own sake

128
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,280
it's not because subsidy it's not

129
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,800
because I love the the the the the

130
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,600
planet Earth because it's

131
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,440
cheaper right that's that's why

132
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,880
important point to make yeah we is I

133
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,560
mean again most that's the common human

134
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,120
decision making process here right the

135
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,319
second so that's the first point the

136
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,120
price the second part is convenience in

137
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,120
electric vehicle convenience measured by

138
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,599
charging process as John mentioned

139
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,520
there's so much problem in us let me

140
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:17,440
give you a

141
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,560
figure that's the comparison of a

142
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,080
charting point that just got

143
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,720
July uh also give account the China's

144
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,759
population four times

145
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:32,560
us so even you do the per capita sense

146
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:32,560
China is four times more char in por per

147
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,919
capita uh so that's the second reason

148
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,759
Chinese buy EV because it's cheaper and

149
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,319
it's

150
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:46,360
convenient right uh by the way for the

151
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:50,400
chartings uh uh ports uh the percent

152
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,680
that's this DC fast charger in China is

153
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,080
half and us is a

154
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,520
quarter so there are more charger in

155
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,160
China and they are high capacity charger

156
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,479
fast charger and they are actually more

157
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,680
reliable as

158
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,840
well right so that's the second main

159
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,800
reason right the charting in is not like

160
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,639
fully the problem is not fully resolved

161
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,440
but most of Chinese customer no longer

162
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,960
see this as a major

163
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,639
problem right so cheaper price

164
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,120
convenient charging this is the

165
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:24,080
fundamentals yes right uh of course this

166
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,840
is all about the vehicle itself to

167
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,000
support the industry you need a whole

168
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,360
set of uh supply chain ecosystem right

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,039
let just name a few electric vehicle you

170
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,240
need charging do the charging you need a

171
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,840
grade on the use side on the

172
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,520
manufacturing side to make electric you

173
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,360
need a battery you need a mineral you

174
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,319
need

175
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,960
processing uh so here and also you have

176
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,840
Finance safety Equity all the other

177
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,560
issues here right uh in from the battery

178
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,879
John just mentioned China dominant not

179
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,560
only battery but whole supply chain uh

180
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,080
from here the EV down to battery cell

181
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,440
cell component mineral process

182
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,560
mining red is China you can see that

183
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,560
it's

184
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,080
dominant that so here China solved both

185
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,280
the cheaper price and a more charging

186
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:15,319
problem but also the entire supply chain

187
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,599
is doing well this right uh a moment

188
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:21,479
which talk about the private car if you

189
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,360
look at public transit uh China is even

190
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,039
more so in the dominance this is the

191
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,199
number of electric buses in the world uh

192
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,759
between China Europe United States Etc

193
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,839
so that's the to talk

194
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,800
about uh by by the way the I just

195
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,399
mention a little bit on public transit

196
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,440
because that's a important part of the

197
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,919
sector but often uh less understood and

198
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,480
often in the United States I would say

199
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,959
ignored this right uh the

200
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,839
electrification that's a part but in

201
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,920
more in

202
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:55,279
general uh in China or actually in

203
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:58,680
Europe in many part of Asia the position

204
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,279
of public transit in big cities at least

205
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,839
uh is

206
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:06,160
un challengeable there's no ambiguity on

207
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,360
that everybody respect public transit is

208
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,959
the backbone of the urban transportation

209
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,399
system but in the United States is far

210
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:17,399
from that we have a much difficult

211
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:20,880
problem physical cliff social agenda of

212
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,399
uh uh the public Transit Agency I

213
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,800
imposed upon

214
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,000
many social issue that beyond the

215
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,120
running the trends for example homeless

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,959
issue gun violence issue mental health

217
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,240
issue all this problem Fair evasion even

218
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:36,240
I will include that but they all kind of

219
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,079
impose upon the public TR system if you

220
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,200
talk to the agency they yeah they try to

221
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,000
help on this but but there's a reality

222
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,800
I'm good at running Trends I don't know

223
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,440
how to deal with gun violence and mental

224
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,440
health many of the Innovative agencies

225
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,320
will collaborate with social welfare

226
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,079
like social workers to collaborate but

227
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,079
still challenging but overall I just say

228
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:56,959
it's a very difficult situation but let

229
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:59,480
me come back to

230
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,279
electrification a couple years ago the

231
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,959
electric bus side the issue is there's

232
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,839
no demand the different cities are not

233
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:08,000
interested in this but in the last few

234
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,800
years every single City if you look at

235
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,839
their sustainable plan or climate change

236
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,959
plan we all say by 2040 we want to 100%

237
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:19,600
Electrify buses by 2035 by 45 different

238
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,600
Paces but overall all the cities claim

239
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,640
that we are going to Electrify our buses

240
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,839
right at the same time you'll find we

241
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,720
don't produce them anymore in

242
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,600
US I mean exact a little bit this is the

243
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,760
few companies there uh pra declared

244
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,560
bankrupt Nova said we're no longer

245
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,760
interested in us Market we retract to

246
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,720
the Canada there's only one meaningful

247
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:47,639
player there at the same time China in

248
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,720
byd and youon one with two top public

249
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:54,160
transit companies they happily produce

250
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,240
and sell to us but they cannot because

251
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,560
of the geopolitical reason that John

252
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,160
just mentioned here right so that's

253
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,200
another episode I to mention right okay

254
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,320
come back to to cars um about the

255
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,720
success right electric vehicle success

256
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,639
one simple theory is the following oh

257
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,920
China is also an terent regime the

258
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,079
president she said we're going to

259
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,079
Electrify our cars therefore we do it

260
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,279
right there there's some truths to that

261
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,600
I mean that's an important part of this

262
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,600
top down approach that that important

263
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,800
but I think that's far from the the the

264
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,440
comprehensive uh uh reality of what

265
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,839
happened here right so let me give you a

266
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,920
few uh examples

267
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,720
the first thing is uh uh in China

268
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,000
there's a group called EV 100 that's a

269
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,880
group that include government officials

270
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,200
uh Scholars EV manufacturers local uh

271
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,000
politicians uh battery makers uh great

272
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,399
great uh people these 100 people have

273
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,120
been talking for years right they

274
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,320
negotiate they have this like meeting

275
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,200
like this let's talk about it they

276
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,839
recognize the importance particularly uh

277
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,120
John mentioned the uh previous mentioned

278
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,320
the minister Wang Gang uh who's a key

279
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,360
person who trained in Germany understand

280
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,000
the Auto industry very well came back to

281
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,360
China uh become a minister who pushed so

282
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,199
much on this but not himself he brought

283
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,959
a whole group together right this e 100

284
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:19,959
is a nonprofit organization have been

285
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:23,519
negotiating for years later when you see

286
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:25,720
uh China formal uh publish this formal

287
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,000
policies about electrification that's

288
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,480
collaboration between Ministry of

289
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,680
Transportation Ministry of Finance

290
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,160
Ministry of science technology those

291
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,360
policy are very much based upon the EV

292
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,320
100's recommendation so when the

293
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,079
government introduced a policy it has

294
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,639
the the grassroot foundation from the

295
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,720
society from the industry already here

296
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:47,120
right so it's not just like a somehow

297
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,880
the central government is said we do

298
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,680
that we said thing and then other people

299
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,680
listen to that

300
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,680
right so here so what really happens

301
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,440
here right a couple things here this is

302
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,160
overall there's the market size and

303
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,600
growth the supportive policies The

304
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,120
Venture investment the industry players

305
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,199
and the consumer adoption uh let me talk

306
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,880
a few of them let me start with the

307
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:18,399
policies here you know in the Biden

308
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,680
adion uh this whole BR uh by bipartisan

309
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,279
infrastructure Bild the ra inflation

310
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,399
redu actually Etc in the way for for

311
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,440
Chinese they will look at this oh us

312
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:29,880
tried to copy our Five-Year

313
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,880
Plan that's again the the The

314
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,839
Superficial view of this is trying to

315
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,639
introduce or reintroduce the industrial

316
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,560
policy or industry strategy right but it

317
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,880
turns out that when you want to do a

318
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,480
industry policy I'm not debating you

319
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,680
should or not it's a matter of two

320
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,480
things one is your attitude oh recognize

321
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,120
we want to do it but the second thing is

322
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,079
competence even you want to do this

323
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,320
National Industry policy it takes effort

324
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,639
takes experience takes talent to do it

325
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,040
China in the past 40 years has been

326
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:05,399
specializing this they put a lot of

327
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,279
effort developing a coherent National

328
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,600
policy supported by local policy

329
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,000
supported by local industry understood

330
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,959
by the public but us when you try to do

331
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,560
that I think it's a rather rather rushed

332
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,160
right without a broader understanding of

333
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,480
it let me just give you

334
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,120
example uh if you talk to a late person

335
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,800
in the ground oh how many you know about

336
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,240
ra how much you read ra what it's about

337
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,519
most people have no clue what you talk

338
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,160
about mean audience here probably you

339
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,680
would read R look at the the the the

340
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,680
evidence here right in contrast when the

341
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,360
when the central government in China

342
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,040
published the fiveyear

343
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,839
plan in China at least I would say

344
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,720
onethird of the people who are in some

345
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,160
position right either leadership in

346
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,480
politics in academics industry they read

347
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,680
this fiveyear plan as a Bible they read

348
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,399
every single sentence of it right it

349
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,560
takes it seriously on this right so

350
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:02,279
that's a really important contrast here

351
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,920
uh a few specific ones the there's three

352
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,000
set of a policy that relevant to

353
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,160
electric vehicle the first one is

354
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,160
technology right here you may heard this

355
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,720
notion of made in China 2025 China sees

356
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,519
electric vehicle as opportunity to Leap

357
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,800
Frog uh in the car industry we recognize

358
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,399
if we compete on the industrial U sorry

359
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,560
internal combuster engine we cannot beat

360
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,880
the BMW and Volkswagen those people

361
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,000
they've been down through the four

362
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,480
century we can beat them but electric

363
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,519
vehicle it's not that complicated into

364
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,560
the engine part right the other part

365
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,440
China innovated a lot on battery on

366
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,360
infotainment system or software defined

367
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,839
vehicle customer BRS that's where this

368
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,360
100 experience is very much irrelevant

369
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,279
and China sees the opportunity that's

370
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,680
first one right uh then also nowadays

371
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,680
the auton vehicle that relate to

372
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,440
artificial intelligence that's also area

373
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,360
that China sees significant effort to

374
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,519
push that's first one uh the second one

375
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,399
is on infrastructure that I think is not

376
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,319
a surprise probably if you go to China

377
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,639
you recognize almost every aspect of

378
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:07,040
infrastructure China is way better uh

379
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,600
high speed rail Bridges highways

380
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,199
internet all these infrastructures uh

381
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,759
the just much more capable to to do that

382
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:16,720
uh that's the second part then the last

383
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:20,199
part is this climate

384
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:25,160
um climate I would say put it this

385
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:29,120
way neither China or us are sincere

386
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:32,319
Europe is right for us and China if you

387
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,600
put a society as a whole is not sincere

388
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:37,360
right neither the country this right uh

389
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,040
but specifically in of policy uh we

390
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,160
China does did announce this goal about

391
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,759
carbon neutrality by 2060 this right but

392
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:50,480
that's a further way uh policy China

393
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:53,680
still the like biggest C by far uh in

394
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,920
fact um during the climate

395
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,600
negotiation uh China or or broadly

396
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,759
speaking developing country as a group

397
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,680
even though China is not debatable where

398
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:06,319
where to put it uh often the debate goes

399
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,039
like this oh I'm polluting a lot now uh

400
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,679
but you guys the referring to the

401
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,199
Western you guys have been polluting

402
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,079
from past two centuries here right uh

403
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,720
when you develop you pollute now it's my

404
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,959
time to pollute you don't want me that's

405
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,120
the argument but just last year China

406
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,400
actually passed a bar in term of the

407
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,319
cumulative CO2 emission you look at the

408
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,039
history entirely China is passing uh

409
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,919
Europe on that right so that argument no

410
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:33,799
longer flies here right that's absolute

411
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,440
number in the entire historical

412
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:38,039
accumulation is bigger right it's not

413
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,840
the there but nonetheless from Electric

414
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,880
Vehicle point of view all three policy

415
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,799
combined really have a big push for to

416
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,320
promote this but this is not just the uh

417
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,640
a national policy if it come down to the

418
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,480
local

419
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,880
level uh that's where the uh in the

420
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,039
United States the the different layers

421
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,000
of the government is rather disconnected

422
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:59,360
they I mean in the in the very positive

423
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,679
they are very independent so therefore

424
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,640
resident but in China it's more coherent

425
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,360
in this way it's not like they they

426
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,280
don't have conflict they a lot of debate

427
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,679
and tensions but overall when the

428
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,240
national government push a general

429
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,240
agenda is to the local government

430
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,640
interest to follow that agenda because

431
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,679
it comes with

432
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:21,360
resources uh with funding but also comes

433
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:25,360
with uh the particular individual

434
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,840
politicians future Prospect of promotion

435
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,840
so the interest very much aligned for

436
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,760
the local government to follow so

437
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,080
therefore each cities will develop its

438
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,280
own policies and guideline to support

439
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,520
this broader uh uh policy let me give

440
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,760
you one

441
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:44,240
example in Beijing and Shanghai uh if

442
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,840
you to buy a car uh you need to join

443
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,919
something called a a vehicle license

444
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:52,640
quota system uh uh at a different point

445
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,200
uh both cities recognize the two Med

446
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,080
cars in the in the streets so they start

447
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,960
to issue number of

448
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,520
quotas um so basically each month the

449
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,320
government will announce this month we

450
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,720
only allow uh 20,000 new cars onto the

451
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,840
streets right so who get this 20,000

452
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,640
license uh beijan and Shanghai choose

453
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,919
different way of allocation Shanghai

454
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,400
choose a lottery system so you pay and

455
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:17,880
you bid for the price while Bing choose

456
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,240
a lottery system uh you you you just try

457
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,280
your luck a lucky

458
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,240
draw first of all you can see that the

459
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,159
two City have a very different flavor if

460
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,600
you're familiar with China if ask you to

461
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:28,760
guess which one is which you probably

462
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,480
guess Shanghai is more Market oriented

463
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,120
approach using loction uh auction while

464
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,360
Beijing is more planning oriented using

465
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,840
Lottery but in this regard it doesn't

466
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,799
matter they both use uh quota control

467
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,320
but then for both cities they will

468
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:44,480
allocate certain proportion of quota to

469
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,240
the new energy vehicle or here basically

470
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,559
electric vehicle here right uh and then

471
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,799
they gradually increase this quota on

472
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,120
the electric vehicle side so more or

473
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,440
more to the degree that if you want to

474
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,640
buy a car you have to buy electric

475
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,400
vehicle there's no more this the quota

476
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,640
on the n the IC is smaller and smaller

477
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,760
so this is one example of how local

478
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,679
government echoing the national

479
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:11,360
government policy to promote electric

480
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:14,159
vehicle uh all right so here the

481
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,640
question they ask so what policy is this

482
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,919
about this electric vehicle is a

483
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,120
transportation policy uh not much at all

484
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:22,480
yeah because from a traffic management

485
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,159
point of view Urban Mobility point of

486
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,840
view electric vehicle it generate

487
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,760
congestion generate the safety issue

488
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:32,000
have the acity issue is very similar

489
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,280
this uh so it's the Environmental Policy

490
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,960
uh

491
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,960
partially uh first of all the the energy

492
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,799
mix in China is still 60% co-based right

493
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,120
so if anything is a transfer the

494
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,480
pollution from this distributed in the

495
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,960
urban cities to the source of the

496
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,320
electricity there even though China also

497
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,640
changing quite a bit on the uh uh uh

498
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,039
electrification El electricity

499
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,320
generation part with the solar panels

500
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,000
when power Etc but that's separate

501
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,400
discussion there then the next one is

502
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,159
industrial policy as mentioned to grow

503
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,080
the market many cities see the car

504
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,720
industry as their pillar industry but

505
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:11,720
finally I want to add uh what really get

506
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,600
to the almost the emotional response to

507
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:19,880
Chinese is the energy

508
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:22,600
policy uh China has about one M of oil

509
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,400
preserve so if there's a w China was cut

510
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,400
off you can maintain one M uh you can

511
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,159
imagine that as Chinese leaders or even

512
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,679
late person they understand this

513
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,240
so energy policy is you it hit you at

514
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,279
the guts right so we cannot rely on

515
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,440
imported oil as we do today so many of

516
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,600
them will very much support this shift

517
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,240
uh to electric base why which then

518
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:47,080
either coas or nuclear or or solar they

519
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,720
can solve that problem right so electric

520
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,880
vehicle really reflect a different set

521
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,640
of a policy intention they very much

522
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,640
aligned uh in that right so that's the

523
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,080
first part on the policy

524
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,200
side but the second part uh

525
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,320
so the the the first of all the the

526
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,039
policy side often being seen as oh this

527
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:09,000
is unique the the the Chinese government

528
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:11,840
is putting lot of subsidies and favism

529
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,039
to the electric vehicle uh as mentioned

530
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,760
that that's partly true but I do want to

531
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:19,279
mention that the part coming from the

532
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,279
genuine Innovation from the industry

533
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,039
right uh I mention three things The

534
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,120
Innovation the diversity and a

535
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,640
competition uh if you look at electric

536
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:32,080
vehicles if you go to a Chinese market

537
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:35,120
you you almost be like a it's kind of

538
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,159
Fantastical uh the the level and the

539
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,080
rich of the Innovation here's the three

540
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,679
examples on this battery swap we talked

541
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,679
about here in the US a long long time

542
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,240
which we didn't really scale it at all

543
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:49,559
uh but in China you see the particular

544
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,960
Neo have thousands of this uh uh battery

545
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:54,520
swapping station uh where if you look at

546
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,039
the process is amazingly

547
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,200
automated you don't even need to uh get

548
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,799
off your car drive into it uh it will

549
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,279
you had the robotic arm change the

550
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:06,559
battery within a few minutes you can

551
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:08,880
just drive out right uh this one this

552
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,360
Comfort entertainment uh you can use the

553
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,799
car as your like personal family uh

554
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,120
theaters uh the the also put not necess

555
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:19,600
all the innovation in the end Will

556
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:23,200
Survive but the the spirit of

557
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,919
experimenting uh uh is just dazzling

558
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,000
right you will have a refrigerator in it

559
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,000
uh you can layout as as a bed you can

560
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,760
have the movie all sort of innovation on

561
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,640
that again I'm not sure all this

562
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,919
Innovation Will Survive but some of them

563
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,320
will the point is they're willing to try

564
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:42,600
and how much new thinking are put into

565
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:45,480
that related to that is this uh this

566
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,760
cycle like in typical s of every two

567
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,840
years or three years you have a new

568
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,360
model Etc China really changed that

569
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,679
notion on this they inovate in a much

570
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,559
rapider way as John mentioned many of

571
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,000
them are coming from the more software

572
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,799
engineering tradition or every two weeks

573
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,559
I was sending your patch we upgrade

574
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:06,440
something there right so that's the uh

575
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:09,080
last one about this super

576
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,240
cheap a couple thousand dollar level

577
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:15,039
right but it's not the best car but it's

578
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,320
a reasonable car right uh this W huai

579
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,520
remember at that time uh Tata in Indian

580
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,640
developed this tiny car small car

581
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,440
utterly failed but this one actually

582
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,279
really successful many people uh in

583
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,960
China this is particularly in the rural

584
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:32,520
area uh people love it right tiny car

585
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,120
very cheap uh and also I can pluging

586
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,200
into my household utility it takes a

587
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,120
long time to charge doesn't go that far

588
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,600
but for most of data use is is

589
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,320
sufficient right uh these just three

590
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,240
example for many many Innovation you

591
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,080
will

592
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,840
see the second one is the diversity this

593
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:53,760
is draw this uh uh diagram being cheap

594
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:58,440
to expensive this from the B to PL EV to

595
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,159
EV you'll find that uh almost every part

596
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:04,600
is covered by some company in China

597
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:07,480
doing it right um the ecosystem just is

598
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,640
so exciting Imagine This Way in the

599
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,679
United States I would say if if not

600
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,360
Tesla the whole industry is irrelevant

601
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,960
there not much going on at all imagine

602
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,960
10 Tesla like companies simultaneously

603
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:24,159
innovate competing competing with each

604
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,279
other in China as of today yeah the here

605
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,120
this is the examples here they come from

606
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:31,279
the EV manufacturer Lee Neil cell pone

607
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,039
byd come this are other side of the

608
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,880
smart vehicle ACC we ride pony catel

609
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,440
well and then there's why in the middle

610
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,360
doing both

611
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:45,159
side uh I think one of our uh M

612
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,080
initiatives advisor uh Mary Chan uh we

613
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:48,880
had this advisory meeting John hosted

614
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,919
that she mentioned go to China you look

615
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,320
at the streets half of the brand she

616
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:56,960
never she never thought never heard of

617
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,640
she's a like a 30y year uh veteran in

618
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,880
the car industry knows everything about

619
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,799
car goes to China half of the brand she

620
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,240
never seen right so that's the dynamism

621
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:09,799
in that right of course uh it sounds

622
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,880
nice what this means is in the next five

623
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:17,520
to 10 years There Will Be Blood bass in

624
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,240
China right even as big as China's

625
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,240
Market we cannot support hundreds of

626
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,000
these car companies right lot of them

627
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,880
will be retired uh die off but new wi

628
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,960
were coming out but that makes this

629
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,559
creative destruction at the best

630
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,600
right in a way uh we talk often talk

631
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,640
about China is capitalism or socialism

632
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,880
in that particular regard if one spirit

633
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,600
is is creative destruction in the car

634
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,480
vehicle industry I think China practiced

635
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,360
the best and us I would say we lost that

636
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,159
Spirit we the system does not allow

637
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,360
certain company to retire right and it

638
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,679
makes a new new new company to enter the

639
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,039
market so difficult right but China is

640
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,919
kind of opposite in that so for this

641
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,360
case yes so this is the the second part

642
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,960
right I will argue there's the policy

643
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,399
part which indeed there's a lot of

644
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:10,320
subsidies from the government giving you

645
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:13,120
uh R&D loans uh giving you uh cheap land

646
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,120
uh tax uh reduction consumer rebate

647
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:19,440
across the board that that that's very

648
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:23,000
true right uh but the important thing

649
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,360
is whatever happened

650
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,440
beforehand as of today in a way it's

651
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,559
irrelevant because the Chinese company

652
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,039
are indeed strong now you make debate oh

653
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:35,279
the process for it to be strong is

654
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:38,399
unfair or something but that's gone as

655
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,600
of today a Chinese car company it's just

656
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,399
better right that's important thing and

657
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,000
they they independent enough now you can

658
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,760
say our government we no longer need

659
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,640
those type of subsidy which as a

660
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,799
sophisticated industrial policy

661
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,039
practitioner China is actually gradually

662
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,120
reducing those subsidies along the way

663
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,720
right many of them are reti as you

664
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,440
mentioned the national subsid is already

665
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,679
gone this so you know way it's very

666
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:07,200
ironic when us criticize China saying oh

667
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,080
you're subsidizing your industry well US

668
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,320
federal government subsidized $7,500,000

669
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:14,960
by EV and Chinese nor does it so this

670
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,360
argument doesn't really fly anymore this

671
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,200
right uh so that's the policy part but

672
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,720
then the second half is the industry

673
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,159
Innovation on own that's the genuine

674
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,080
power shows uh but the second part I

675
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,000
want to talk about the consumer

676
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,960
preferences uh you know the so which

677
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,880
features attracts a car buyer this right

678
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:41,640
there's a recent uh uh survey down by

679
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:43,559
McKenzie look at EU us and China the

680
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,279
result really surprised many people

681
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:49,279
including myself if you look at what

682
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:52,159
feature do people pay attention uh this

683
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,159
around pricing total cost driving

684
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,080
performance vehicle consumption

685
00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:00,600
efficiency size driving range then

686
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:03,240
technology vehicle brand experience

687
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:07,120
sustainability Cutting Edge technology

688
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,480
material zero carbon interior design M

689
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,919
uh driver assistance system connectivity

690
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,320
personalization all these features right

691
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,240
first of all us and Europe they're very

692
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,720
similar they all focus of very kind of I

693
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,360
say classic features right but look at

694
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,640
the

695
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,640
Chinese they interesting of course the

696
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,480
same thing efficiency safety but also Al

697
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,720
They also interest sustainability

698
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,679
Cutting Edge technology in the vehicle

699
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:37,480
uh driver assistance system connectivity

700
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,919
those things the the I would say Chinese

701
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,159
consumer actually ahead of the rest of

702
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,679
the world

703
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:48,600
right this uh evolution of this this

704
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,760
preferences enabled by The Innovation

705
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,399
that the local companies providing in

706
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,440
China this right so that the success of

707
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,240
EVS really come from three parts the

708
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,200
government policy support the innovation

709
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,200
from the industry and also the

710
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,519
consumers uh yeah maybe I talk about

711
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,679
this the second part it's about the

712
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,559
notion of Car Pride and the behavior

713
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:16,000
part of the John mention uh this is uh

714
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:19,679
um kind of a a uh

715
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,840
prototypical uh uh stereotypical view of

716
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,919
these modal biases of preference uh

717
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,360
particularly in the United States right

718
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,440
but this is true across the board right

719
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,360
uh we actually studied the the notion

720
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,679
called Car Pride where defined the

721
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:38,559
notion as uh the value you get of owning

722
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,799
the car beyond the instrumental value of

723
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,080
moving from A to B beside moving around

724
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:45,519
what additional value you get it's

725
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,039
called Car Pride you can measure them

726
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:51,159
and you'll find that this car Pride will

727
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:54,840
posi influence car ownership uh buying a

728
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:58,240
car buying early spend more more luxury

729
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,399
car I use more use more frequently so

730
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,279
that's the general finding on this uh

731
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,360
but what we we did is we compared that

732
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,840
across about 50

733
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,320
countries uh but this is this about 80

734
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,559
years old now so we should update uh we

735
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,080
survey these people in these 50

736
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:19,760
countries to measure that this notion of

737
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,000
cight here right uh so it labeled as

738
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,639
down in the bottom is a lower cight on

739
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,200
the top is high copright so which

740
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:31,080
country have a higher copright uh Kenya

741
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,480
uh UAE India Vietnam Philippines

742
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,200
Malaysia

743
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,559
Thailand who has the lowest copyight

744
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,639
Japan Ukraine France Greece Chile

745
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:44,279
Austria uh Switzerland right you can see

746
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:49,360
a quite clear pattern

747
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:51,519
there the uh developed country generally

748
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:56,799
have a lower car

749
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:58,360
PR except uh United States here this

750
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,840
right uh

751
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,440
the developing country

752
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:06,639
there has quite a high Car Pride there

753
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,679
but what's interesting is at the same

754
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:12,399
time often the people live there they

755
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,240
have high desire but this desire being

756
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,960
suppressed because the lower income so

757
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:22,679
what this means is when the GDP grow and

758
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:25,000
income grow as we we hope they do this

759
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,480
preference will be expressed more so if

760
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,360
you really think about the number of

761
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,320
cars people will want into the future

762
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,440
this when this group uh country getting

763
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,120
richer Etc the car consumption will

764
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:39,200
continue grow in this all right but I

765
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,799
mention Cary back to China right you

766
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,000
know just a couple years

767
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:47,320
ago buying a BMW buying a dla Mercedes

768
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
all those things it's you you acquire

769
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,720
this strong cpride between this premium

770
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,159
car versus the uh the kind regular

771
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:59,080
family car right and this particularly

772
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,760
reflected on German made cars

773
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,159
right in China That's everyone is

774
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,519
talking about this yeah there's a jokes

775
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,320
of if a young man want to get married

776
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:10,000
the the the future mother-in-law will

777
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,559
ask you do you own a house and do you

778
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,080
own a car that's the question and

779
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:16,080
particular which type of car this right

780
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,960
but almost

781
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:23,720
dramatically yeah in the last few years

782
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:26,559
this notion of this German premium uh

783
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,600
coprite almost entirely

784
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:32,200
destroyed yeah Chinese pring buying

785
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,080
local cars right compared to the

786
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,480
technology compared to safety compared

787
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,519
to the efficiency it's just better right

788
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,399
so this is a major change that we

789
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,440
observe in the Years all right so we

790
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,960
skip this one uh but the second

791
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,279
discussion to maybe end the presentation

792
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,919
here is about the relation between China

793
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:55,240
and the world uh uh as John mentioned

794
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,799
there's a lot of differences changed

795
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,799
first of all the the export China uh

796
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:02,760
used to be like nonexistent to show up

797
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:06,519
to be the the top one uh in term of the

798
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,720
the the total uh uh export but here I

799
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,440
just want to say that the E growth in

800
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,560
China is not a

801
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,560
surprise in the following sense China

802
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:21,240
has done this multiple times in the 80s

803
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:23,839
we started with shirts toys TVs cell

804
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,720
phones computers either we don't know

805
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,359
how to do that once we knew Master the

806
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,879
the the technology

807
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:35,599
what produces the way better uh uh cost

808
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:37,480
efficiency scal it up and then export it

809
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,320
right and this same thing is apply to

810
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,440
high speed rail architecture design

811
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,079
genetic testing uh so I'm not saying not

812
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,839
just the lower level techn but into very

813
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:49,639
advanced technology so e is not a

814
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,399
surprise to see these type of uh uh

815
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:55,320
changes right uh last thing I was say

816
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,440
the current response given this where

817
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,480
you're putting this High tariff I think

818
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,880
is not a good strategy for US own

819
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,520
interest uh this is a combination of

820
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,160
high tariff with high

821
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,560
ego uh it's not like you kind of do

822
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,880
tariff China did tariff Korean did

823
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,280
tariff Taiwan all did that the way you

824
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,520
do it is you set a tariff roughly equal

825
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,280
to your technology differential between

826
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,000
the different domestic market and the

827
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,520
foreign market so that you you keep the

828
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,760
dtic market enable to survive but you

829
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,880
still keep the pressure

830
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,920
right so over the time you reduce the

831
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,880
terror so that your domastic can compete

832
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,480
this blond instrument actually doesn't

833
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,839
help anybody here right the only thing

834
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,960
this you make your domestic uh car

835
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,000
manufacturer lose this incentive

836
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,079
continue innovate in this so as as a my

837
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,240
personal recommendation is us should

838
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:52,000
invite the Chinese one into the US

839
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:55,000
market so that US market can catch up

840
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,380
and learn from each other uh thank you I

841
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,959
stop here

842
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,959
[Applause]
