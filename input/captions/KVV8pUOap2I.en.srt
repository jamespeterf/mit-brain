1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,320
um today we're going to turn to a new

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,559
topic remember sort of in the topics

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,960
part of the course now we talked about

4
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,359
Factor markets and things like investing

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,039
decisions and interest rates and things

6
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,039
like that now we're going to come to a

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,439
new part of the course which is talk

8
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,599
about international trade international

9
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,320
trade is one of the central econ issues

10
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,520
in all of economics as with every topic

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,840
we cover in this course we won't do

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,239
enough Justice we'll just do two

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,680
lectures but if you find it interesting

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,480
we have an entire course called 1454

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,239
which is all about International Trade

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,600
so sort of to give you a taste of how we

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,879
can apply the tools of basic

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,760
microeconomics to important questions

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,920
one of which is trade now here's a

20
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,239
question for yall how many of you have

21
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,480
ever given or received roses on

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,440
Valentine's

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:04,479
Day the unromantic MIT crowd never fails

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:07,240
to amaze me okay well uh turns out

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,799
Valentine's Day is uniquely badly

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,400
positioned for the us because it's in

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,680
February and that's a hard time to grow

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,400
roses so for years what we did if you

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,079
want to give roses in February had to

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,759
buy them from a especially grown from

31
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,799
hot houses that were specially set up to

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,840
grow roses so have them available in the

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,079
winter to deal with this inefficiency of

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,280
a flower-based holiday being in February

35
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,600
AR we had to have special special

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,880
production of roses well that changed

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,880
because it turns out that the perfect

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,920
place in the world to grow roses is

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,799
right around Colombia and Ecuador in

40
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,040
South America they're perfectly tempered

41
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,079
they're on the equator you can always

42
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,119
grow roses there very coste effectively

43
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,640
indeed when I visited Colombia and was

44
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,880
driving around there are these enormous

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,079
Rose Farms they got to stop at one they

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,560
have 15 literally this Rose farm we sto

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,960
that shipped shipped out thousands of

48
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,079
roses every single day to all over the

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,560
world they even had different sections

50
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,160
for different countries so in Russia

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,000
they like long stem roses they had a

52
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,160
Russian section with long stem roses

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,040
they had a Us section with the kind of

54
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,000
roses we like it was an incredible

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,239
production and it's easy because it's

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,879
warm there all year so the question is

57
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,480
is that a good thing or not on the one

58
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,280
hand we get cheap roses and if you all

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,040
were a little more romantic you might

60
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,280
value that you might value having

61
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,680
cheaper roses that you could buy or

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,400
maybe you would be more romantic maybe

63
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,319
you're just romantic but fiscally

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,599
prudent with cheaper roses maybe you can

65
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,280
give more roses to your loved ones on

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,519
the other hand all the guys who had jobs

67
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,159
producing roses have lost their jobs

68
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,720
there were presumably hundreds not

69
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,800
thousands of people involved in growing

70
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,640
these roses in the US they're not out of

71
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,840
work because we get them from

72
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,080
Colombia this debate over the fact that

73
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,000
consumers get Goods cheaper but

74
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,680
producers lose their jobs is the heart

75
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,480
of the debate over International Trade

76
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,760
okay this is a particularly important

77
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,519
topic right now because

78
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,760
traditionally The Divide over

79
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,159
international trade as I mentioned when

80
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,680
I talked about voluntary export

81
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:16,239
restraints was strally broke down along

82
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,799
party lines with Republicans favoring

83
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,280
free trade and Democrats opposing free

84
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,599
trade that's sort of reversed over the

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,080
last several decades the largest free

86
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,040
trade initiative of the last 50 years

87
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,519
was Bill Clinton's NAFTA a Democrats

88
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,400
Bill the North American Free Trade

89
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,720
Agreement which opened up trade between

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,720
the US Mexico and Canada in a very free

91
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,080
basis and the biggest opponent of free

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,920
trade in the white in the over office in

93
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,760
the last 50 years was Donald Trump who

94
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,560
used TR Tools of trade to go after China

95
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,239
to clear sort of economic war of China

96
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,480
in particular um Donald Trump imposed a

97
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,720
tariff which is a tax on imported goods

98
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,519
from

99
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,680
China um so in fact parties reversed now

100
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,879
it turns out basically now we a

101
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,480
situation where everybody's against free

102
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,799
trade indeed presid President Biden has

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,879
kept in a lot of the Trump anti-trade

104
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:10,120
practices that were in place free trade

105
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:12,319
is very unpopular right now okay now the

106
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,360
extent to which countries participate in

107
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,199
international trade is is described by

108
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:21,199
two quantities there's

109
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,800
exports those are Goods produced

110
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,199
domestically but consumed

111
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,199
abroad and there's

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,520
Imports which are Goods produced abroad

113
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,360
and consumed

114
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,600
domestically so exports are Goods that a

115
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,400
country sells to the rest of the world

116
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Imports our Goods a country buys from

117
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,440
the rest of the world currently in the

118
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:50,160
US we have about two trillion do worth

119
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,360
of exports we currently export about $2

120
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,000
trillion doar worth of goods and we

121
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,000
import about 3.2 trillion so exports are

122
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,240
2

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,120
trillion Imports are 3.2 trillion

124
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,360
ion the difference Imports minus

125
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,919
exports Imports minus exports we call

126
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,199
the trade

127
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:19,080
deficit so we have a $1.2 trillion trade

128
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:22,400
deficit that means we import about $1.2

129
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,120
trillion more worth of goods than we

130
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,120
export this was a large focus of the

131
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,039
Trump presidency and of many

132
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,880
politicians as a sign was it was as a

133
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,840
sign of us weakness that we have this

134
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,319
giant trade deficit with other countries

135
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,960
they were exporting quite more than they

136
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,919
were importing but in fact that

137
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,919
intuition is completely

138
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,440
wrong and to see why let's start with a

139
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,479
simple

140
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,199
example okay suppose you and your best

141
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,440
friend both love

142
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,280
Pokemon and you love all the Pokemon

143
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,120
equally you want to collect them all

144
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,560
okay you got to catch them all you got

145
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,360
you love all the Pokemon equally you

146
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,840
love Pokemon your friend Lov Pokémon and

147
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,840
you valow them all pretty equally so

148
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,919
let's say that uh you have two Pikachus

149
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,080
and your friend has two jigglypuffs and

150
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:09,560
let's say you and your friend think

151
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,840
Pikachus and jigglypuffs are pretty much

152
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,639
worth the same thing I'm not a Pokemon

153
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,319
if it'sit youan enough to know if that's

154
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,440
true but let's say they're roughly worth

155
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,599
the same thing so let's say you go to

156
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,800
your friend and say look I have two

157
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,599
Pikachus you have two jigglypuffs I'm

158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,360
GNA trade you one Pikachu for one

159
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,240
Jigglypuff and your friend says yeah

160
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,919
that's great I'd love that deal I don't

161
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,599
have any jiggly I I don't have any

162
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,240
Pikachus so you make the trade and you

163
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,160
go from two Pikachus and no jigglypuffs

164
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,639
to one Pikachu and one Jigglypuff and

165
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,599
your friend goes from Two jigglypuffs

166
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,960
and no Pikachus to one Jigglypuff and

167
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,280
one

168
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,120
Pikachu now what you've just done is

169
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,400
created a Pikachu trade

170
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,840
deficit think about it you used to have

171
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,720
two Pikachus you in I'm sorry you you

172
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,319
you've just created I'm sorry a

173
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,400
Jigglypuff trade deficit you've just

174
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,360
imported one jiggly

175
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,599
puff and you've exported zero

176
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,120
jigglypuffs so you've created a

177
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,000
Jigglypuff trade deficit you could see

178
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,560
you know presidents ranting about the

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,240
Jigglypuff trade deficit America will

180
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,240
always be a second class Nation as long

181
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,039
as we have a Jigglypuff trade deficit

182
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,680
you might say well that's silly and

183
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,560
you'd be right that is silly but it's no

184
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:28,560
sillier than worrying about the general

185
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,199
trade deficit indeed let's just um

186
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,240
imagine

187
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:37,000
we replaced you with the United

188
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,599
States your friend with

189
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,160
Columbia Pikachu's with dollars and

190
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:45,680
jigglypuffs with

191
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,879
roses then we just made the same trade

192
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,240
we just sent them dollars to buy

193
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,680
roses it made us better off because we

194
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,319
wanted the Roses it made Columbia better

195
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,919
off because they want our dollars so who

196
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,360
lost no one

197
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,879
lost it was just a trade that make both

198
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,520
sides better off which is what trading

199
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,159
does we've we've increased we've created

200
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,240
a deficit with

201
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:11,319
Colombia but only because the deficit is

202
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,159
measured in dollars not in

203
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:16,120
welfare yes we have a trade deficit but

204
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,440
we also have a rose

205
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,560
Surplus okay and just like we don't care

206
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,599
about Jigglypuff deficits versus Pikachu

207
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,440
surpluses we don't really care about

208
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:28,879
dollar deficits versus good

209
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,960
surpluses okay we're happy to make this

210
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:35,360
trade and indeed blocking this trade

211
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,760
would lower social welfare for the same

212
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,200
reasons that blocking any

213
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,399
trade where the marginal benefits exceed

214
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,600
the marginal cost lower social

215
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,320
welfare okay that's a fundamental

216
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,360
initions of the First Fundamental law of

217
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,839
welfare

218
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,080
economics which is that basically

219
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,680
anytime there's a trade where the

220
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,600
marginal benefits keep the marginal

221
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,560
costs you should allow that trade to be

222
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:02,160
made if you don't welfare is lower and

223
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,440
that in a nutshell is why economists

224
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,560
support free trade that's it and we'll

225
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,279
go through the math and stuff like that

226
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,120
through this lecture but that's really

227
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,920
the intuition is that economists support

228
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,480
free

229
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,880
trade because if there's a trade that

230
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,120
both parties want to make uh we should

231
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,240
let it

232
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,680
happen okay now of course this is much

233
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,360
more complicated in

234
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,720
reality one complication arises because

235
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,519
the issue we've just been discussing in

236
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,720
the last few

237
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,920
which is market

238
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,040
failures trades only make both parties

239
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,519
better off if you're in a perfectly

240
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,640
competitive market if not they might not

241
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,279
make both parties better

242
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:45,560
off another issue is that we might care

243
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,680
differently about winners and losers

244
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,720
remember I've discussed in this class

245
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,720
how the classic definition of social

246
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,959
welfare simply adds up producer consumer

247
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,839
surplus we said that has some nasty

248
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,959
implications like for example we're

249
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,959
totally indifferent between a perfectly

250
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,160
competitive outcome and a perfectly

251
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,640
price discriminating monopolist outcome

252
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,000
we're perfectly indifferent between

253
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,880
consumers getting some Surplus and

254
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,519
consumers getting no Surplus that

255
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,680
doesn't feel

256
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,279
right likewise we might not be

257
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,560
indifferent between people getting

258
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,800
cheaper roses and other people losing

259
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,120
their

260
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:22,399
jobs okay and as a result the standard

261
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,040
model might not work in reality but it's

262
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:29,040
important to understand the standard

263
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,279
model first it's important to understand

264
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,399
why Economist favor free trade and then

265
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:38,639
we can talk about in the real world why

266
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:41,040
there might be rationals for opposing it

267
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,240
okay so that's the setup what we want to

268
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,800
talk about International

269
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,519
Trade I'm then going to to understand

270
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,839
naal trade I'm going introduce a new

271
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:55,720
tool into our toolkit which is the

272
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:58,320
production possibilities Frontier the

273
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,760
ppf the production possibilities

274
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,639
Frontier

275
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,720
the production proess abilities

276
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:09,720
Frontier is going to A New

277
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,320
Concept we've talked about economies of

278
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,240
scale economies of scale is the idea if

279
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,240
you get twice as big or do you produce

280
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,160
twice as

281
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,279
much now we're talking about A New

282
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,399
Concept economies of

283
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,399
scope economies of scope are relevant

284
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,440
when you the firm produces multiple

285
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,320
different

286
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,920
Goods an economy of scope arises when

287
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,240
producing one good makes you more

288
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,839
productive at producing the other good a

289
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,519
dis economy of scope arises when

290
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,040
producing One Good Makes You worse at

291
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,279
producing the other

292
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,079
good and we illustrate this economies of

293
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,120
scope or dis economy scope through a

294
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:52,720
production possibility Frontier as an

295
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,720
example let's go to figure

296
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,279
181 F figure

297
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,639
181a okay here we have an economy scope

298
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:02,480
so let's let's think of a simple example

299
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,760
as always it's good easier with two

300
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,760
goods let's think of yourself as the

301
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,240
firm you're the firm and you produce two

302
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,800
things you produce exams and problem

303
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,800
sets Okay that's what you do you're

304
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,320
producing that's life at MIT right your

305
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,160
firm in MIT produce exams problems

306
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,560
that's set your life for four years okay

307
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,040
now imagine that um you have a certain

308
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,760
amount of inputs and obviously you can

309
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,600
vary your inputs and that could lead to

310
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,519
economies of scale twice as much time

311
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,560
studying could double your score or it

312
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:34,880
could less than double your score that's

313
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,360
economies of scale okay but now I'm

314
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,279
saying let's hold the time constant say

315
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,720
a certain amount of time you want to

316
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,519
spend studying now the question is on

317
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,720
how much time you spend studying which

318
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,440
is the economy of scale question but how

319
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,480
you devote your time which is economy of

320
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,399
scope

321
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,560
question and let's say for example that

322
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,920
the course has 10 problem sets worth 20

323
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,600
points

324
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,480
each or one exam worth two worth 200

325
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,920
points that's the way the grading in

326
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,320
this course works and your goal is to

327
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,040
get the best possible

328
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,839
grade well you can decide how to devote

329
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,079
your time between working on problem

330
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,440
sets and studying for the

331
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,320
exam imagine it's multiple exams with

332
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,880
200 to make it a little more continuous

333
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,040
okay there's multiple exams worth 200

334
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,560
points total so you can decide how to

335
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,639
devote your time between throughout the

336
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,279
semester by working on problem sets or

337
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,199
studying for the

338
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:29,560
exam so let's say for example you decide

339
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,079
you're going to spend all all your time

340
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,880
studying for the exam and none working

341
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:37,240
on problem sets then you're at the x

342
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,480
intercept in in the linear PBF you get a

343
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,760
perfect score in the exam but zero on

344
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,000
problem sets

345
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,240
likewise if you decide to spend all your

346
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,480
time on problem sets you might get a

347
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,839
perfect score on problem sets but you'll

348
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,639
get zero on the

349
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:53,600
exam okay the question we've drawn the

350
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,920
first graph is it's linear literally

351
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,880
it's a equal tradeoff every point you

352
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,920
give up on an exam you get in a problem

353
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:03,519
set but in fact there's strong reasons

354
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,920
to believe that there' be economies of

355
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,680
scope between doing problem sets and how

356
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,000
you do the exam or studying for exam

357
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,560
doing the problem sets because the same

358
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,160
work the more time you spend on problem

359
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,279
sets the better you might do in exams

360
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,759
the more time you spend studying for

361
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,240
exams the better you might do on problem

362
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:24,199
sets that would lead to an economy of

363
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:28,199
scope and an outward bending

364
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:31,160
ppf okay that lead you on scope and and

365
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:33,880
basically uh you'd have a convex

366
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,199
production possibilities Frontier the

367
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:39,959
convex production possibilities Frontier

368
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:41,839
arises when it's more efficient to

369
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:44,560
produce Goods

370
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,959
jointly than it is to produce them

371
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,240
separately so it's ever more efficient

372
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,880
to produce Goods jointly than separately

373
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,279
then that will give you the convex

374
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,320
production possibility Frontier we call

375
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,680
that an economy of scope okay it's more

376
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,399
effici do stuff together than do them

377
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,399
separately question about

378
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,480
that now you can also get dis economies

379
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,480
of

380
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,680
scope okay that would be Illustrated in

381
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,399
figure 181b that would be a

382
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,120
concave um production possibility

383
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,880
Frontier where literally you're better

384
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,759
off doing one or the other but the

385
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,920
combination of the two makes you

386
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,199
worse now it's hard to see that in our

387
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,920
example let me give you an examp real

388
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,800
world example of this which is when I

389
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,240
was an MIT undergraduate I was a pretty

390
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,800
good tennis player as on the MIT tennis

391
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,160
team JV okay wasn't great but I was on

392
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,680
the tennis team okay and but I'd never

393
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,639
tried squash before and people said

394
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,160
you're a college you know you're you're

395
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,680
an elitist East coaster you got to play

396
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,839
Squash okay so I decided fine I'll go

397
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,079
try squash Well turns out tennis is all

398
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,279
about not using your wrist and squash is

399
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,279
about using your

400
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,360
wrist tennis you're about trading that

401
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,319
ball flat squash you're about sort of

402
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,720
slicing it and hitting using your wrist

403
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:57,240
and it turned out the more I played

404
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,399
squash the more screwed up my tennis

405
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,720
game and the more I played the more

406
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,199
screwed up my squash game that was a

407
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,000
diseconomy of scope if I can use such a

408
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:09,680
sort of an elitist example of a

409
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,759
diseconomy of scope okay where doing one

410
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,680
made me worse at the other

411
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,160
one okay so both things can be true you

412
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,279
can have both economies of scope and dis

413
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,440
economies of

414
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:25,160
scope in your production possibility

415
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,160
Frontier questions about

416
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:34,120
that okay with that in mind now we want

417
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:36,160
to turn to our classic Model of trade

418
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,440
we're going to talk about this is really

419
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,839
one topic sorry I wrote this with a thin

420
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,920
chalk it's it's hard to see comparative

421
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,880
advantage and models of

422
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,759
trade so we're going to turn to the

423
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,399
topic

424
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,399
of comparative

425
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,959
advantage and

426
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:01,480
trade okay now let's we're going to the

427
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,639
way we think about international trade

428
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,039
in convenient way is we use what's

429
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,679
called 2 by two models this is the

430
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,360
Workhorse of international trade if you

431
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:13,280
st 15 1454 this is where you'll start

432
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,280
1454 two by two trade models two

433
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,120
countries with two

434
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,720
goods there's no money in these models

435
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,280
it's two countries two goods so let's

436
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,839
for example imagine our two countries

437
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:29,799
are the US and

438
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:32,000
Colombia and our two goods are roses and

439
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,520
computers so imagine world with just two

440
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,720
goods in them roses and

441
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:41,200
computers and just two countries that

442
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:44,520
produce those goods the US and Colombia

443
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,160
the idea is Colombia it is relatively

444
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,440
easy to grow

445
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,880
roses because the weather conditions are

446
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,720
such but in the US it's relatively easy

447
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,720
to make computers because we have highly

448
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,000
skilled

449
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,039
workers so that's the setup of the model

450
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,720
so we're going to put particular

451
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,480
examples on it here's a particular

452
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,520
example this is the way a 2X two model

453
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,280
looks so for example let's say we have

454
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,320
two goods we have

455
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,520
roses and computers let's say we're

456
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,200
talking about a dozen roses versus a

457
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,360
computer okay so this is a dozen roses

458
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:20,000
versus a

459
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,000
computer okay and then we have

460
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:29,200
Colombia and the

461
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:32,159
US okay and let's say that the only

462
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,159
input to producing these Goods is labor

463
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,919
obviously untrue certainly with

464
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:37,400
computers there's a lot of capital

465
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,440
involved but once again we're going to

466
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,080
start with this easy model two goods two

467
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,240
countries one input obviously all those

468
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,280
numbers can expand you can have two

469
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,280
goods two countries six inputs or six

470
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,280
countries eight Goods four inputs

471
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,320
anything can go on but life can be

472
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,880
easiest if they have two countries two

473
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,400
goods one input the input is

474
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:00,520
labor and that input produces we're

475
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,480
going to have a constant return scale

476
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,320
model where basically we're going to

477
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:11,240
Simply say that produce to produce one

478
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:14,960
carton of roses in Colombia takes one

479
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:18,360
worker okay takes one

480
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,159
worker okay uh I'm sorry takes one hour

481
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,840
of Labor these are hours of

482
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:26,039
Labor so there's one carton of roseen in

483
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:30,039
Columbia takes one hour of Labor is one

484
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:32,039
computer takes eight hours of Labor

485
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,520
in the US to produce one carton of roses

486
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:36,000
takes two hours of

487
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,200
Labor and to produce one carton and one

488
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,200
computer takes three hours of

489
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,720
labor now based on these numbers we can

490
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,240
draw the

491
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,280
ppfs for the US and for Columbia and

492
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,480
they're going to be linear I haven't put

493
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,400
any economies of scope in here I've just

494
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,080
made them linear so if you look at

495
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:01,480
figure

496
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:05,120
182 here are the PPS for Columbia in the

497
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,159
US in a given day if we think of a

498
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,679
budget of 24 hours so imagine we're

499
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:10,400
going to do the ppfs for a given

500
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:12,240
remember ppfs are about for a given set

501
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,919
of inputs here this inputs is going to

502
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,400
be 24 hours of Labor before it was two

503
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:19,799
it was a certain amount of time you had

504
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,559
studying now it's 24 hours of labor for

505
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,320
a given set of inputs which is 24 hours

506
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,640
of Labor what can we produce well in

507
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,080
Colombia with 24 hours of Labor we could

508
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:32,320
produce 24 cartons of roses or three

509
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,960
computers or some combination of the

510
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,360
two in the US we could have 12 carts of

511
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,440
roses or eight computers or some

512
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,799
combination in

513
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,840
between the line connecting those is the

514
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:47,600
ppf the ppf shows you the combinations

515
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,840
you can have for a given level of inputs

516
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,720
and in our example it's linear just to

517
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,760
make life easy you could obviously make

518
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,320
it more complicated the economies a

519
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,360
scope but this econom a scope but it's

520
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,120
easiest if it's linear so i' got these

521
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,120
simple prod simple linear production

522
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,720
processes one

523
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:05,559
input constant marginal

524
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,799
cost okay it's just literally constant

525
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:08,919
marginal product I'm sorry constant

526
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,799
marginal product of labor constant

527
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:13,159
marginal product of labor literally

528
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,919
every time you want to produce uh

529
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:17,720
another row it takes one unit of Labor

530
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,520
in Columbia two in the US okay so lots

531
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,840
of assumptions floating around here

532
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,200
constant marginal product of labor one

533
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,360
input two countries to Goods okay

534
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,000
questions about that let me pause this

535
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,159
is a hard but important model let me see

536
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,240
if there's questions about how this is

537
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,360
set

538
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,400
up

539
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:40,919
okay

540
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:45,159
now we want to ask who has the

541
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:47,360
advantage in producing these goods and

542
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,880
the way we want to ask it is through the

543
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,880
lens of

544
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,080
comparative

545
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,200
advantage that is we don't want to ask

546
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,520
who's better at it we want to ask ask

547
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,799
who's relatively better at

548
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,400
it so for example who has the

549
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,760
comparative advantage in roses well

550
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,520
Colombia we to answer this question we

551
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,000
go back to opportunity cost and the

552
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,559
reason we think of things in relative

553
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,720
terms because then we can express the

554
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,600
opportunity cost mathematically what is

555
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,440
the opportunity cost of producing a box

556
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,760
of roses in Columbia what do you have to

557
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,520
give up to get a box Rose in Columbia

558
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,039
what do you give up yeah yeah what Hour

559
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,520
1 hour but what does that give up but

560
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:37,720
it's all the hour time

561
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,480
yeah in Colombia you give up uh you give

562
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:43,159
up 1/8 of a computer that's exactly

563
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,760
right so it's time okay I love the

564
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:46,360
celebration we got the answers right

565
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,279
that's good you celebrate that you're

566
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,640
doing a great job okay so in Colombia to

567
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:55,600
the opportunity cost of a box of

568
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:58,679
roses which takes an hour is 1/8 of a

569
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,679
computer which also takes an hour in the

570
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:06,080
us now person us an hour what's the

571
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,080
what's the opportunity cost of a box of

572
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,120
roses two-thirds of a

573
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:15,400
computer okay so the opportunity cost of

574
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,919
a box of roses in Colombia the

575
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,880
opportunity cost of box R of Columbia

576
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:23,159
is8 of a

577
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,600
computer the opportunity cost of box in

578
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:28,520
the US is 2third of a

579
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,600
computer so what we say is since

580
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:35,120
Columbia has a lower opportunity cost

581
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,320
they have a comparative advantage in

582
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,480
roses Colombia has a comparative

583
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,640
advantage in Rose production why because

584
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,840
the opportunity cost is relatively

585
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,480
lower flipping that okay so let me stop

586
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,320
there so Columbia is a comparative

587
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,240
advantage in

588
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,799
roses now let me be clear for a second I

589
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,000
want to distinguish comparative

590
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:58,559
advantage from this the term advantage

591
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,600
or what we call absolute advantage

592
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,200
I want to distinguish those and the best

593
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,400
way to distinguish those is of course to

594
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,760
think about LeBron James mowing his

595
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,600
lawn okay let's think about LeBron James

596
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,640
mowing his lawn now LeBron James does

597
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,760
two things play basketball and mo is

598
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,960
lawn okay and let's assert LeBron James

599
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,279
is better than anyone in the world of

600
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,960
both playing basketball and mowing his

601
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,679
lawn LeBron James be an awesome I mean

602
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,279
the guy's built right he just crank on

603
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:25,320
that lawn okay so let's assert LeBron

604
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,200
James is the best person at both mowing

605
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,080
his lawn and playing basketball he has

606
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,480
an absolute advantage in both

607
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,440
activities but he has a comparative

608
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,840
advantage in playing basketball in other

609
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,720
words he's way better let's take LeBron

610
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,000
James versus me now there's two goods

611
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,720
playing basketball and mowing lawns and

612
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,760
two countries LeBron James and Gruber

613
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,039
okay LeBron James has a massive

614
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,520
comparative advantage in playing

615
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,600
basketball I suck at basketball okay

616
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,279
he's a un a billion to one compar

617
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,520
advantage in playing basketball mowing

618
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,760
laws he's maybe five to one he's

619
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,159
certainly better than me at mowing aan

620
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,720
but is he more than five times could he

621
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,240
do it five times faster than me probably

622
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,840
not so LeBron James is an absolute

623
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,440
advantage over me in basketball and

624
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:15,120
lawnmowing but his comparative advantage

625
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,240
is basketball LeBron James should and

626
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,279
this will be the hint of where we're

627
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,360
going LeBron James should specialize in

628
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:23,080
basketball let mimo the

629
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,039
lawn now in fact I shouldn't know the

630
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,320
lawn

631
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:30,279
either CU Let's Take Me versus a a uh L

632
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,080
landscape contractor and let's do

633
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:35,000
economics and

634
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,279
lawnmowing I am certainly better than

635
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,679
the land the average landscape

636
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:40,360
contractor at

637
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,480
economics I'm probably worse at

638
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,919
lawnmowing so I should then hire the

639
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,640
landscape contractor it's all about

640
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:48,279
comparative advantage it's what are you

641
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,279
relatively better

642
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:54,480
at okay now let's go back to another

643
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:57,720
example who has the comparative

644
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,320
advantage in computers and why which

645
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,600
count is compar advantage of computers

646
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,600
and

647
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,640
why which of these two countries has the

648
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,000
comparative advantage of computers and

649
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,000
why

650
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:14,039
yeah right so what's the opportunity

651
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,039
cost of a computer in the

652
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,480
US yeah go ahead three halves for

653
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,960
computers this is

654
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,399
roses for computers the US opportunity

655
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,159
cost is three halves what's the

656
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:27,159
opportunity cost in Columbia

657
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,360
eight so the US has a comparative

658
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:37,760
advantage in computers a lower given the

659
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,080
fifth bump go ahead the lower

660
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,520
opportunity cost in computers the US is

661
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:46,279
a comparative advantage in computers

662
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,640
okay so in this model Colombia has the

663
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:52,039
comparative advantage in roses the US

664
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:55,960
has the comparative advantage in

665
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,679
computers okay now let's go back now

666
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,880
let's let's add one more wrinkle to this

667
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:04,440
exam to this example I've already made

668
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:06,440
it simple enough I've said look

669
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,640
constant uh you know constant marginal

670
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,600
product of

671
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,399
labor okay one input now let's go

672
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:16,480
further let's imagine these goods are

673
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:19,120
perfectly com in perfectly competitive

674
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,840
markets let's imagine the goods are per

675
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,080
are bought in perfectly competitive

676
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,760
markets and let's start with a simple

677
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,080
example of what we'll call sort of a

678
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,200
weird word but I don't know why we call

679
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,720
it

680
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,799
autarchy art

681
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,919
autarchy a u t a r k y autarchy it

682
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,240
simply means no trade I don't know why

683
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:43,360
we use that fancy

684
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,799
word okay but basically you know this is

685
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,559
the secret to why economists are

686
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,159
successful and wealthy is they would

687
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,760
make up fancy words for really easy

688
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,519
Concepts it makes it sound smart so we

689
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,279
call it autarchy but it just means

690
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,960
there's no trait okay in a world of

691
00:27:54,279 --> 00:28:00,360
autarchy each country has to produce its

692
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:05,480
own own computer and Roose computers and

693
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:07,679
Roses now let's ask in a competitive

694
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,480
market let's say there a competitive

695
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,679
market for goods and for labor and the

696
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,240
wage rate is W the wage rate in this

697
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,960
competitive market is

698
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,960
W

699
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,960
okay

700
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,720
now you can then tell

701
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,159
me and let's say W's the same both

702
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,640
countries

703
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,720
there's a wage rate W you can tell me

704
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,000
what

705
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,000
price roses will sell at in the

706
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:44,960
US at what price will roses sell in a

707
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,279
perfectly competitive Rose Market with a

708
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,720
perfectly competitive labor market and O

709
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:49,640
HW what will be the price for roses in

710
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,240
the

711
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,399
US well what what is what is price equal

712
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,080
in perfect competition don't raise your

713
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,880
hand and tell me yeah marginal cost

714
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:04,399
what's the marginal cost

715
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:07,399
to W so we know that roses the price of

716
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:10,320
roses in the US will simply be two w

717
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:12,320
we're done all I had to give you was

718
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,600
this and like you could tell me the

719
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:19,440
price we know the price for computers in

720
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:23,720
the US will be 3w we know the price of

721
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,960
roses in Colombia will be one W and we

722
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,120
know the price that's roses I'm sorry

723
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,600
yeah Pros in Columbia the price of

724
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:34,399
computers in Columbia will be 8w we know

725
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,120
all the prices simply because we know

726
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:39,279
under perfect

727
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,840
competition okay we know under perfect

728
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,840
competition what how prices relate to

729
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,919
Marginal

730
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:51,720
costs okay so basically in the US if the

731
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:55,559
US simp if you cannot

732
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,159
trade then in the US computers Will T

733
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,559
will cost one and a half times as much

734
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:59,840
as roses

735
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,960
the price of a could be one and a half

736
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,399
times the price of roses in Columbia

737
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,200
Computer cost eight times as much as a

738
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:07,240
rose so if you can't trade we know what

739
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,279
the market is going to look like in each

740
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,399
of these

741
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,159
countries okay we know what the Market's

742
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:13,840
going to look like in each of these

743
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,120
countries so

744
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:22,559
now let's

745
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:25,840
imagine that we actually allow

746
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:29,600
trade well if you allow trade here's the

747
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,960
miraculous piece by allow trade you

748
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,640
create economies of

749
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:39,480
scope allowing trade creates economies

750
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:43,399
of scope to see why I go to figure

751
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,840
183 imagine that both countries oh let's

752
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:48,480
go to figure

753
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,320
183 and um if both countries only

754
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,279
produce roses they set their work

755
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,600
workers to work 24 hours a day producing

756
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:58,240
roses then we end up with 36 roses how

757
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,760
do we know that well look at figure 182

758
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,360
if both countries only produce roses we

759
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,440
get 36

760
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,840
roses 24 in Columbia 12 in the US if

761
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,679
both countries only produce computers we

762
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,200
get 11

763
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:18,080
computers eight in the US three in

764
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:19,960
Columbia okay now but what happens if

765
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,960
the country

766
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:28,960
specialize what if the us only produce

767
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:32,159
computers and Colombia only produce

768
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,960
roses well how many computers we we get

769
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,960
we get eight

770
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,960
computers how many roses would we get we

771
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,600
get 24 cartons of

772
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:45,240
roses if you graph that you get an you

773
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:49,039
get a outward bending

774
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:51,840
ppf you just created economies of

775
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,159
scope not through any

776
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:59,039
magic but simply

777
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:01,279
through comparative advantage yielding

778
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,399
specialization and that's the key

779
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:07,039
Insight of trade Theory the comparative

780
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,000
advantage yields specialization LeBron

781
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,919
should just play basketball I should

782
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,240
just do economics my lawnscape

783
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:14,639
contractor my lacap contractor should

784
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,519
just mow my lawn LeBron shouldn't mess

785
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:20,279
with Mo in his lawn I shouldn't mess I

786
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,679
shouldn't mess with Mo in my lawn okay

787
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:23,399
and the bottom line is if you've

788
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,440
comparative advantage in a certain

789
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:29,760
activity you should specialize in that

790
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:33,519
activity by doing so you

791
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:37,720
create you create economies of scope

792
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,720
which we also call gains from

793
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:48,279
trade gains from trade you create gains

794
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:52,120
from trade by allowing folks to

795
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:56,159
specialize okay so to see

796
00:32:52,120 --> 00:33:00,159
that further let's

797
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,760
imagine that let's imagine that the

798
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,720
relative trading price of computers is

799
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,440
four now you know what the relative

800
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,679
prices are with art tarkey once we open

801
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,440
up the trade is going to depend on

802
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:09,720
Demand right you I you can't tell me the

803
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,000
world with trading what price is going

804
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,000
to be I'm gonna have to choose the

805
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,880
demand curve okay in art tarkey it

806
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,919
doesn't matter what demand is Right

807
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,360
perfect competition dictates this with

808
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,159
trading it matters it depends how much

809
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,200
we want computers roll to roses and we

810
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,200
don't know that yet so I'm going to make

811
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,320
life easy I'm going to come back to this

812
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,039
I'm going to start by just

813
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,320
assuming that the price of computers

814
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:37,279
there's free trade and on the World

815
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,559
Market the price of computers equals

816
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:41,919
four times the price of roses I'm just

817
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,760
going to assume that in the World Market

818
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,880
that's what happens I'll come back to

819
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,440
how you get there but for now it's easy

820
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,240
to start with assuming that so we open

821
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,600
up to trade and let's assume the price

822
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:56,279
for computers is four time the price of

823
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,080
roses okay well what you can see is that

824
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:00,519
by specializing

825
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,799
we open up new consumption opportunities

826
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:06,639
go to figure

827
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:10,440
184 the red line in figure

828
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:13,240
184 was the artar possibilities we saw

829
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:17,639
that already the blue

830
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:20,040
line is with World Trade at a price of

831
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,320
four the trade

832
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,200
possibilities the blue line is

833
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,720
everywhere outside the red line each

834
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,399
country can do better with trade or they

835
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,440
could do no worse so if Colombia only

836
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:35,839
wants roses they're no they're no worse

837
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,399
off with trade but if they want any

838
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:42,440
computers they're better off why because

839
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:43,960
they can produce roses cheaply and trade

840
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,119
them for

841
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,480
computers the us if it only wants

842
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:51,679
computers is no better off at trade but

843
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,599
if wants any roses it's better off

844
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,599
because it can produce computers

845
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,880
efficiently and then sell them cheaply

846
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,040
for roses

847
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,040
so by allowing each country to

848
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,760
specialize we can allow for expanded

849
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,839
production

850
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,960
possibilities by allowing each Char to

851
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,720
specialize we can allow for expanded uh

852
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,680
production

853
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,800
possibilities okay so basically what

854
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:24,240
this means is as long as with the price

855
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:28,240
of with a price ratio of

856
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,680
four okay as long as country want some

857
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,200
of what the other country has you are

858
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:35,119
better off with free trade than with our

859
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,079
turkey and that's the

860
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,760
proof you're better off to trade with

861
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,880
arkey and simply the magic it's the all

862
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,280
the the magic that's happening here is

863
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,400
simply by allowing countries to

864
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,599
specialize you get them take you get

865
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,319
them to use their competitive advantage

866
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:51,280
and produce more with artar we didn't

867
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:53,920
the US was inefficiently forced to

868
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,839
produce roses it's much more efficient

869
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,599
to produce computers and trade them for

870
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:00,920
Roses so by allowing that that trade we

871
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:05,359
allowed more consumption

872
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:09,040
possibilities in both the US uh and in

873
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,040
Columbia questions about

874
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:15,359
that now in this

875
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,359
example I made up the price so let's

876
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,720
think more

877
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:19,720
generally yeah I'm

878
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,280
sorry great question so so what I've

879
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,640
missed from this model is the whole

880
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,640
demand

881
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,720
side what they decide to give themselves

882
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,280
what side of trade is going to depend on

883
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,760
the relative demand for computers and

884
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,599
Roads across the countes that's going to

885
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,640
yield this price which I just made up so

886
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,680
basically what they're going to decide

887
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,880
to do is going to depend on how much

888
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,560
each country wants computers and

889
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,359
Roses okay so to see that let's go to

890
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,319
figure

891
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:56,880
185 which is a little confusing okay but

892
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:59,839
basically what this says is point let's

893
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,400
start at point

894
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,520
B

895
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:08,880
okay let's imagine where at point B at

896
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:12,000
point B okay um the price ratio is

897
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,720
four okay four cartons of rows yield one

898
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,760
computer okay but let's say that at

899
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,960
point

900
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,240
B there's an overall increase in World

901
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,680
demand for

902
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,760
computers folks want more computers than

903
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,640
point B so point B yields eight

904
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,000
computers a day and let's say the the

905
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:35,160
world in general wants more than

906
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:39,079
that okay so in that case you would move

907
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:42,040
down from point B along that slope

908
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:44,200
segment towards C Colombia would then

909
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,359
say look I'm going to start producing

910
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,640
computers okay it's relatively

911
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:50,280
inefficient but if the world really

912
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,680
wants them that's what I'm going to do

913
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,800
I'm still going to

914
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:58,160
trade but I'm not going to purely

915
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,720
specialize so pure specialization is is

916
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,599
a special

917
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,240
case in general countries whether

918
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,720
they'll only purely specialize under

919
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,440
certain conditions generally countries

920
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,440
will produce some of both but they'll

921
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,880
still relatively specialize in the thing

922
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,079
they have a comparative advantage at let

923
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,000
me say that again pure specialization

924
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:22,640
only emerges as this particular case in

925
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,200
general countries are will shift once

926
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,599
you open up to International Trade

927
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,960
countries will shift towards producing

928
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,680
the goods they have a comparative

929
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,359
advantage in they might not go all the

930
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,400
way it won't be as Extreme as my pure

931
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:38,520
special a example but the direction is

932
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:43,480
clear now at some point that will

933
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:46,280
end okay imagine that we get to a

934
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,000
point where the price of computers Rel

935
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,800
to roses is

936
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,119
10 imagine demand for computers as such

937
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,280
Rel to roses the price of computers Rel

938
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:59,680
to roses is

939
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:03,920
10 well basically that would say a

940
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:07,880
Colombian producer says look I have a

941
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:11,839
choice I can give up

942
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:15,640
one box of roses and get

943
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:18,680
10 computer and I I'm sorry basically if

944
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,760
I produce one computer it will yield 10

945
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,280
box of

946
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,599
roses if the world price gets to 10 10

947
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,480
box of r at that point columia will say

948
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,200
forget it I'm just going to produce

949
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,880
computers too

950
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,200
okay so you can imagine a world where

951
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,520
everyone specialized computers likewise

952
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,079
the price of computers is low enough

953
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,920
everyone could specialize in roses so

954
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,200
where you end up on this graph depends

955
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,440
on the relative

956
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,640
demands that is much more complicated

957
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,800
I'm not going to model that I go back

958
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,800
and forth way I should model that but

959
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,000
take another half hour it's not worth it

960
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,640
I think we can get the intuition without

961
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,880
the model OKAY the basic intuition is a

962
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:57,640
for prices in a broad range from a price

963
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,200
of three halfs to a price of eight price

964
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,839
in that range there'll be some

965
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,560
specialization as long as you are

966
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,680
somewhere on that ppf there'll be some

967
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,480
specialization if prices get too low or

968
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,599
too high you want a specialization

969
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,599
anymore but in general you get

970
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:12,880
specialization how much specialization

971
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,079
you're going to get is depend on the

972
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,359
relative demand for the two goods if the

973
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,440
world mostly wants computers then NE

974
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,800
also will produce more computers than

975
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:23,200
Columbia Columbia will still produce

976
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,680
some if the world's mostly wants roses

977
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,160
then Columba will produce more roses in

978
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:30,520
the US but us will still produce some

979
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:34,000
okay okay questions about

980
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:37,319
that so the bottom line is comparative

981
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,920
advantage yields specialization and

982
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:42,720
that's yields gains to trade so that's

983
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:45,520
the thought linkage okay comparative

984
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:49,040
advantage means that folks want to

985
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:53,000
specialize which yields gains from

986
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:55,040
trade if there was no trade LeBron would

987
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,480
have to mow his

988
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,319
lawn okay think about that if there was

989
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,280
no trade LeBron because LeBron still

990
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:03,839
cares about his LA to mow is

991
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,839
lawn that would be giving up basketball

992
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,560
we all value at many many times his

993
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,200
mowing his lawn that's

994
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:13,440
inefficient we are losing we are happy

995
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,000
to trade me mowing LeBron's lawn for

996
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,160
getting to watch LeBron play basketball

997
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,400
we're all happy to make that trade

998
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,720
probably even me okay I like basketball

999
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,440
okay we're all happy to make that trade

1000
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,599
so by not allowing that trade we make

1001
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,800
Society worse off that's why free trade

1002
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:30,960
Mak Society better off because without

1003
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,720
free trade people can't take advantage

1004
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,400
of what they're best

1005
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:39,079
at and that's why we like free

1006
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,040
trade okay questions about

1007
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,160
that now that raises the really

1008
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,760
interesting

1009
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:49,520
question of where does comparative

1010
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,640
advantage come from if comparative

1011
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,160
advantage is so important where does it

1012
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,839
come from well as LeBron examp they

1013
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,880
really can come from two

1014
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,400
places as the LeBron example illustrates

1015
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,240
the first placeing comparative advantage

1016
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,240
what we call Factor

1017
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:11,560
endowments basically who's born with

1018
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,960
what LeBron was born with an innate

1019
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,000
ability to better basketball than I am

1020
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,440
there's you know I'm not saying if

1021
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,839
LeBron never tried and I spent my whole

1022
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,359
life I couldn't be better than him but

1023
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,880
he has an enormous Advantage physically

1024
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,319
Over Me In Playing

1025
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,800
Basketball okay his Factor endowment

1026
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,359
likewise Canada was endowed with massive

1027
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,760
amounts of forest

1028
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,760
land so they have a comparative

1029
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:39,119
advantage in producing

1030
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Timber China is endowed with 1.5 billion

1031
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,800
people so they have a factor endowment

1032
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,720
compared advantage in producing labor

1033
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,599
intensive

1034
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,160
Goods okay basically countries certain

1035
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,920
times countries have Factor endowments

1036
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,800
that give them an advantage like timber

1037
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,160
in Canada or labor in China but

1038
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,359
comparative advantage can also be

1039
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,359
created through

1040
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:14,640
technology there's no reason the

1041
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:16,240
US is better than I don't know Indonesia

1042
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,359
at producing computers the US isn't that

1043
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,839
much bigger than

1044
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,240
Indonesia okay but we are we've used

1045
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:24,880
we've we've pushed along the

1046
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,440
technological Frontier lar through

1047
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,359
investing in human capital to give

1048
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,520
ourselves a technological competitive

1049
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,920
Advantage compartive Advantage versus

1050
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,599
Indonesia does not come from anything

1051
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,839
innate there nothing about the land of

1052
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:38,000
the US makes is better producing

1053
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,720
computers you don't grow anything we're

1054
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,480
better because we've moved further along

1055
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,640
the technological

1056
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,359
Frontier so another way so comparative

1057
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:49,920
advantage can be innate or it can be

1058
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:52,480
produced and that is why a huge debate

1059
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,359
around international trade is basically

1060
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,480
how do we get ahead of other

1061
00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:01,559
countries if you think about the the uh

1062
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:05,079
President Biden's um uh chips and

1063
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:07,599
semiconductor act chips and science act

1064
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:10,920
a lot of what that act did it put 52

1065
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,400
billion dollar into subsidizing the

1066
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,480
production of semiconductors in the US

1067
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,040
maybe you may not know about the

1068
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,559
semiconductor Market semiconductor

1069
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,640
Market while semiconductors were

1070
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:21,680
invented here in the US and we still

1071
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,640
lead technologically in The Innovation

1072
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,800
semiconductors we don't produce

1073
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,040
semiconductors indeed a somewhat scary

1074
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,680
fact if you're if you follow G politics

1075
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,440
is 75% of all 7 conductors in the world

1076
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,640
are produced within 100 miles of

1077
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,920
China now if you think that you're

1078
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,440
worried about a war with China then

1079
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,599
that's kind of a worrisome

1080
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,880
fact moreover there's the view that GE

1081
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,559
we we don't have a compartive advantage

1082
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,040
in trading semiconductors because China

1083
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,839
produced them all what if we produced

1084
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,119
sem what if we invested in the

1085
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:54,079
technology of manufacturing rather than

1086
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:55,559
investing in technology of invention

1087
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,079
what if he invest in the technology of

1088
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,760
manufacturing we got better at

1089
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:59,640
Manufacturing in China then we would

1090
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,319
have a comparative advantage of

1091
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,920
producing semiconductors which Not only

1092
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:05,160
would help our national security be

1093
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,400
vital economic Victory and that's the

1094
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,200
idea of the chips and science Act is

1095
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,200
let's put money into invent investing in

1096
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,680
cuttingedge manufacturing not just for

1097
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,079
Economic Security but eventually give us

1098
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:18,920
a technological comparative

1099
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,839
advantage okay so that's another source

1100
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,720
comparative advantage but there's a

1101
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,000
third Source I should said three there's

1102
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:27,119
a third

1103
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:29,800
source which is not so happy and we

1104
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,640
might call it sort of it's not going to

1105
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:35,240
I don't know have a good label for it we

1106
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:35,240
just call it destructive

1107
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,359
routes destructive routes to comparative

1108
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:44,280
advantage let me give a simple

1109
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:47,160
example one

1110
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,040
reason that China has a compartive

1111
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,880
Advantage not only in things like

1112
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,920
producing textiles butting things like

1113
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:57,280
batteries is because they have really

1114
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,960
weak environmental regulations

1115
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,880
so in the US if you want to set up a

1116
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:05,599
battery Factory you have to pass a

1117
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,800
battery of tests to show that you're not

1118
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,880
doing environmental damage you're not

1119
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,079
harming the people around you in China

1120
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,520
you don't so in China One of the leading

1121
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,079
bad battery manufacturing plants was

1122
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:20,359
leaking the materials that made to use

1123
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:23,200
batteries and PE many hundreds of people

1124
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:25,200
died or got sick in the nearby

1125
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,240
Villages now China had a comparative

1126
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,520
advantage for using batteries you can do

1127
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,280
it more cheaply than we we could so

1128
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,119
we're buying Chinese batteries but at

1129
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,280
what

1130
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:33,440
cost at the cost of making our

1131
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,359
environment worse and harming people

1132
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,119
around

1133
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:39,440
them you can go further we often heard

1134
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,119
the term sweat shops is a term you hear

1135
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,359
the idea people are getting poorly paid

1136
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,680
to do hard jobs many people would argue

1137
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:48,160
that China has a comparative advantage

1138
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,720
in producing things like textiles

1139
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,400
because their workers are working in

1140
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,520
terrible conditions and leading horrible

1141
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,480
lives now we'll come back to that next

1142
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,720
time and ask if that's really a valid

1143
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,000
criticism but people might call that a

1144
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:03,359
destructive route or think about child

1145
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,040
labor in the US child labor is banned

1146
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:08,119
rightly in other countries it's not so

1147
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,920
if other countries use child

1148
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:13,640
labor as a way to get a competitive

1149
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,119
Advantage we might not like that so much

1150
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:17,400
so that's where we start to next time

1151
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:20,359
we'll get to this more that's we start

1152
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,839
to see G maybe free trade isn't always

1153
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:25,040
cracked up to be if the way you get

1154
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,440
Advantage could be destructive then

1155
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,480
maybe we're a little worried about free

1156
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,920
trade

1157
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,559
we add on top of that the fact that free

1158
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,319
trade means that we get cheaper roses

1159
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:37,440
people in the US lose their jobs and we

1160
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,440
care about jobs that's another reason we

1161
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,280
might be a little worried about free

1162
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,319
trade so next time we're going to start

1163
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,359
to ask how do we think about the weal

1164
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:45,680
for economics of free trade and are

1165
00:47:44,359 --> 00:47:48,160
there arguments against it and what

1166
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,559
should governments do if they if they

1167
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,599
don't feel free trade is working to the

1168
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:55,119
best advantage of the world okay we'll

1169
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,119
go there next time
