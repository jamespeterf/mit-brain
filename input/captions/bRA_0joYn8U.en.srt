00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,010
Christopher Capozzola: Greetings, and welcome to MIT.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:08,270
Today, we send special greetings
to our MicroMasters learners

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,750
from around the world.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,610
My name is
Christopher Capozzola.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,170
I'm a faculty member here at
MIT and our Senior Associate

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,920
Dean for Open Learning.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,100
And it is my pleasure
to host here today

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,580
in this celebration of the
completion of your MicroMasters

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,520
credentials.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,580
Congratulations.

11
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,710
Today, we honor 1,276 learners.

12
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,360
641 of you have earned
MicroMasters credentials

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,550

00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,740
of Policy; 57 in Principles
of Manufacturing;

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:53,075
285 in Statistics and Data
Science; and 63 in Finance.

16
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:57,410
Here at MIT, we now have more
than 1.8 million learners from

17
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,870
almost every country in
the world who have enrolled

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,720
in our MicroMasters courses,
and a total of 9,696 people have

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,950
earned their
MicroMasters credential.

20
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,580
That now includes you.

21
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:16,100
Congratulations again to today's
MicroMasters credential holders,

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,450
1,276 of you.

23
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,930
We're thrilled to have you
join the credential-holding

24
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,290
community, and welcome.

25
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,930

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,590
Today, you'll be hearing
from leaders and learners

33
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,770
from all five
MicroMasters programs.

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,510
And at the end, at the
conclusion of our ceremony,

35
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,190
we will be honoring all
1,276 of you by showing each

36
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,440
of your names on the screen.

37
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,920
All right, let's begin.

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,970
Our first speakers are Dr.
Chris Caplice and Dr. Eva

39
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,729
Ponce from MIT's Center for
Transportation and Logistics.

40
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:13,050
They lead our MicroMasters
in Supply Chain Management.

41
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,880
Chris, take it away.

42
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,580
Chris Caplice: All right.

43
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,830
Thank you, Chris.

44
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,250
I apologize for everyone.

45
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,680
I don't have my regalia
because I'm offsite today.

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,180
I'm just glad that
I'm able to be here.

47
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,513
Congratulations to everyone.

48
00:02:25,513 --> 00:02:27,430
You're going to hear
that over and over again,

49
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,347
because we all know how
much dedication, time,

50
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:31,650
and effort went in for you
to earn your MicroMasters

51
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,410
credential.

52
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,930
It's truly a
remarkable achievement.

53
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,650
And many of you did this
at night, on the weekends,

54
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,490
or whenever you could
squeeze in the time,

55
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,930
so we really appreciate that.

56
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,990
And I want to especially
thank your families

57
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,680
for their sacrifice,
because you were doing this

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,340
instead of their family time.

59
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,640
So today, we're thrilled
to celebrate this milestone

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,700
with all of you, especially
the 641 new credential

61
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,255
holders for the Supply
Chain Management program.

62
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:58,630
You've joined a global community
of learners and leaders,

63
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,310
and we could not
be prouder of you.

64
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,550
And now it's my pleasure
to introduce someone

65
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,790
who really leads the entire
MicroMasters for Supply Chain

66
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,670
Management, Dr. Eva Ponce.

67
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,670
Eva Ponce: Thank you, Chris.

68
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,240
As you can see, I'm
wearing my regalia just

69
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,030
to celebrate today with
you this huge milestone.

70
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,880
Hi, everyone, and
congratulations.

71
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,270
Congratulations to all
credential holders.

72
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,880
My name is Eva Ponce, and I am
the Director of Online Education

73
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,670
at MIT, the Center for
Transportation and Logistics.

74
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,210
I have been teaching
for more than 25 years.

75
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,690
And during the
last nine years, I

76
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,520
have been leading this massive
global and online MicroMasters

77
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,520
program in Supply
Chain Management.

78
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,810
This allows me to connect
with this special group

79
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,620
of online learners.

80
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,250
You have shown dedication,
perseverance, grit,

81
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,940
and determination.

82
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,620
And I want to take a moment to
celebrate your big achievement,

83
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,130
because online
education requires

84
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,620
another level of dedication.

85
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,430
I know that.

86
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,790
I have observed you
during this last month.

87
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,040
This is truly another
level of dedication.

88
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,250
Let me share with
you the presentation

89
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,510
we have prepared just to
celebrate this huge milestone.

90
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,330
The first thing we
want to celebrate

91
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,050
is the huge community of
MicroMasters credential holders

92
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,460
in Supply Chain Management.

93
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,990
We have 5,735 credential holders
in Supply Chain Management.

94
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,520
Today, we are celebrating 641--

95
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,000
641 new credential holders.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,090
And you have shown a lot
of dedication and effort

97
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,245
just to be here.

98
00:04:53,245 --> 00:04:59,230
Most of you have watched a bunch
of videos, more than 900 videos,

99
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,150
and spent a lot of
hours per course.

100
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,530
Each of the courses
require more than 100 hours

101
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,510
of effort, a total
of 720 hours just

102
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,550
to complete the entire
MicroMasters program.

103
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,900
So we want to congratulate
you, but also your families,

104
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,625
because their support
also helped you

105
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,620
to achieve this huge milestone.

106
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,870
And also, the credential is
equivalent to one full semester

107
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,580
of coursework at MIT, so that's
why you put a lot of effort

108
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,400
on that.

109
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,610
So again, new
credential holders,

110
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,170
641 credential holders in
Supply Chain Management

111
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:45,730
from 67 countries.

112
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:50,790
We have about 46% of
you that performed

113
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,120
above 80% on the
comprehensive and final exam.

114
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,315
This exam is tough, we know.

115
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,810
And you did a very good
job performing well

116
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,450
on that comprehensive proctored
exam at the end of the program.

117
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,980
We have also 24% of our new
credential holders are female.

118
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,390
I'm glad to see this
number raising up.

119
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,050
I would love to see more
females completing this program.

120
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,860
But yes, definitely
congratulations

121
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,970
to everyone about that.

122
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,980
As I mentioned, it's a global
community of credential holders.

123
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,270
We have new credential holders
from many different countries.

124
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,900
I would say that all
continents-- almost

125
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,140
all continents are
represented here.

126
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,510
As you can see, many
new credential holders

127
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,670
from United States, from
Australia, from China,

128
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,840
from Latin America, from Africa,
and of course, from Europe,

129
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,350
and eight new credential
holders from Spain.

130
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,480
I need to mention that.

131
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,440
You know it's in my
heart, the Spaniards.

132
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,730
So eight new credential
holders from Spain.

133
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:59,940
In terms of the industries
represented here,

134
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,910
most of our new
credential holders

135
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,880
are in Supply Chain
Management, but some of them

136
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,780
are working on operations,
logistics, finance, information

137
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,750
technology, and
also in academia.

138
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,460
We have also many different
companies represented.

139
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,440
Some of our new
credential holders

140
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,060
work in big companies
like Coca-Cola,

141
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,680
tech companies like
SAP or Ericsson,

142
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,240
manufacturing
companies like SLB.

143
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,950
Congrats.

144
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,850
I know we have new credential
holders from SLB today

145
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,910
joining us.

146
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,540
And some are from
consulting companies

147
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,620
like Accenture and Deloitte.

148
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,440
So congratulations to everyone.

149
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,050
In terms of the job titles,
again, a huge variety

150
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,260
of different job
titles represented

151
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,750
in these new credential holders
from logistics managers,

152
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,740
supply chain planners,
directors, and also CEOs.

153
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,220
So we have a huge variety of
different titles represented.

154
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:04,885
We also asked our new credential
holders in our last survey,

155
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,480
once they complete the
entire program, about

156
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,500
the impact of these
credential holders.

157
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,520
And some of you got a raise,
a bonus, or a promotion.

158
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,150
Congrats on that.

159
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:22,420
I cannot end this presentation
without acknowledging that

160
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,650
running a program like this
one, a massive program online,

161
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:29,570
an open enrollment program,
it takes a village.

162
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:35,530
So 64 MIT staff, teaching
assistants, and instructors

163
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:39,280
has been working with us
from the last nine years

164
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,960
just to make this
program possible.

165
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:48,010
If we take into consideration
our group of community teaching

166
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,810
assistants, those
learners that volunteer

167
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,290
to help us to manage the
forums and help our learners,

168
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,270
then we are talking about
400 people just to run--

169
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,330
almost 100 course run
during the last nine years.

170
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,660
But I especially need
to thank my team.

171
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,380
I need to say thank you to
the MicroMasters Supply Chain

172
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,220
Management team for their
dedication, their passion,

173
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,160
and commitment to make
this program possible.

174
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,940
I also want to extend a
thank you to Open Learning,

175
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,130
to Shira Fruchtman, to
Brittney Law, to David Chotin,

176
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,030
and to Dana Doyle, because
they are also supporting

177
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,010
and has been supporting
us since day number 1.

178
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,315
So thank you for that.

179
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:35,330
And finally, welcome.

180
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:39,440
Welcome to this MicroMaster
community of learners.

181
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,330
We are really proud of you.

182
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,300
We are very proud
of your achievement.

183
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,290
Very proud of your
dedication and effort.

184
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,160
Stay tuned, because sometimes
we have some events,

185
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,460
and these events are only for
our MicroMaster credential

186
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,130
holders.

187
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,090
You are now part of this elite
group of credential holders.

188
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,680
So we would love to
see you, welcome you

189
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,190
here on campus Sunday if you
have a chance to join us.

190
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,560
And with that, I want to end the
presentation saying once more,

191
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,530
congratulations on
behalf of my team.

192
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,650
This should be the
beginning, the beginning

193
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,340
of a new adventure.

194
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,030
You are lifelong
learners, so keep it up.

195
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,210
And keep in touch with us, and
celebrate your big achievement.

196
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:30,640
And now let me introduce two
of our new credential holders.

197
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,600
Our first representative
is Caroline Barbosa.

198
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,550
Caroline lives in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, and works

199
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,170
for the company iFood
as a data scientist.

200
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,100
Caroline has been an active
member of our MicroMaster

201
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,920
community through
dedicated involvement

202
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,530
as a community teaching
assistant in some

203
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,710
of our courses.

204
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,500
Caroline, the floor is yours.

205
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,000
Caroline Barbosa: Hi.

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,160
Thanks, Eva.

207
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,460
Hello, everybody.

208
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,480
I'm Caroline.

209
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,620
As Eva mentioned, I work as
a data scientist at a food

210
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,580
delivery based in Brazil, and
it's an honor to be here today

211
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,840
with you.

212
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,620
I joined this program of Supply
Chain Management, MicroMasters,

213
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,700
with the goal of expanding
my knowledge in the supply

214
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,800
chain and analytics, which I
use to work a lot back then.

215
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,040
And I thought I was just
signing up for some lectures,

216
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,190
but I ended up going
so much more than that.

217
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,620
Not only did I learn from
world-class instructors,

218
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,000
but I also had hands-on
projects that I

219
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,180
worked really hard during the
nights or the lunch times.

220
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,720
And I also had the chance
to connect with people

221
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,800
from all over the world who were
on the same journey as I was.

222
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,020
One of the highlights
of my experience

223
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:56,560
was serving as a CTA, which
was also humbling and deeply

224
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,360
rewarding for me,
because you have

225
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,500
to be really creative to help
others understand something

226
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,260
that you know and
explain different ways

227
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,020
so that they can gain the
same knowledge as I did,

228
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,430
and also I learned
along the way.

229
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,010
This program opened
up some doors for me.

230
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,700
I ended up changing jobs
during this program,

231
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:26,170
and that really helped me
a lot gain some confidence

232
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,930
on technical discussions and how
to deal with some of the bigger

233
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:37,770
problems on logistics, which
is the field that I work today.

234
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,850
To everyone graduating
today over the best terms

235
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,320
in some of the MicroMasters,
congratulations.

236
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,150
Your dedication brought
us all today here,

237
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,260
and I hope that with this
knowledge that we gain,

238
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,450
we can build some extraordinary
things in the future.

239
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,340
So thanks, everyone,
and thank you, Eva.

240
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,640
Eva Ponce: Thank you, Caroline.

241
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,670
Thanks for sharing your
journey and experience with us.

242
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,725
Very inspiring.

243
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:08,225
OK.

244
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:11,820
And now we are going to
hear from Tianxu Wang.

245
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,490
Tianxu lives in
Toronto in Canada,

246
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,600
and is currently working as
an SAP Associate Consultant

247
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,430
for Westernacher Consulting.

248
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,260
Tianxu has also been an
active member of the community

249
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,430
as a committee-- is a teaching
assistant for supply chain

250
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,490
analytics.

251
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,470
Tianxu, thanks for joining us.

252
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,830
The floor is yours.

253
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,270
Tianxu Wang: Thank you, Eva.

254
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,030
Actually, it's such a
pleasure, and honestly

255
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,890
a bit surreal to
be here reflecting

256
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,125
on this journey with all of you.

257
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:46,620
So if I had to choose
one word to describe

258
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,910
what the MicroMasters
program gave me,

259
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,440
it would be perspective.

260
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,700
Not just new tools or
frameworks, but a new way

261
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,270
of seeing supply chains.

262
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,910
So when many of us
started in this field,

263
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,230
we focused on execution like
tools, systems, dashboards,

264
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,680
how to get things done faster,
cheaper, and more efficiently.

265
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,040
But this program
challenged that.

266
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,200
It pushed us to ask
why we are doing this.

267
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,300
Who does it affect?

268
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,990
And what does the long-term
value really look like?

269
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,240
It helped me see supply
chain not as isolated steps,

270
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,560
but as living systems shaped
by trade-offs, people,

271
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,740
and decisions.

272
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,160
So once that shift
happened, you start

273
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,730
seeing the world differently,
even in unexpected places.

274
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,010
Like at Costco,
my wife and I were

275
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,380
in line for a
rotisserie chicken,

276
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,680
and I suddenly found
myself recalling

277
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,590
the example Chris used to
illustrate expected unit

278
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,240
[? short ?] from [INAUDIBLE].

279
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,520
So I started wondering,
how does Costco

280
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,090
plan for this crazy demand?

281
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,640
And how much safety
stock do they

282
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,640
need to avoid stockout
while keeping costs low?

283
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,540
So that's when I realized this
wasn't just about knowledge.

284
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,400
It had changed how I think.

285
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,950
And that shift didn't
just stay with me.

286
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,460
So after a few
modules learning, I

287
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,510
started a small supply chain
concept series at work, just

288
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,490
like the informal lunch session.

289
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,180
But soon, more people joined.

290
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,050
So a colleague who used
to focus only on tools

291
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,610
started asking deeper
questions like,

292
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,540
how can we show customers
the value our system brings

293
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,500
across the entire supply chain?

294
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,410
Or how do we design
solutions that

295
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,650
truly enable end-to-end
visibility, not just

296
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,910
the digital version
of their own silos?

297
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,390
So that's when I knew the
mindset shift was spreading.

298
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,740
And that, to me, is where the
real transformation began.

299
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,140
So thank you to Chris, Eva,
and all other professors,

300
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,050
the team behind this program,
and all of my fellow learners.

301
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,200
So let's keep asking
better questions

302
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,310
and building the
future together.

303
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,190
Back to you, Eva.

304
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,220
Eva Ponce: Thank you, Tianxu.

305
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,960
Thanks for sharing
your experience,

306
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,210
and thanks for thinking
on supply chain,

307
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,090
the back end of the
supply chain when you go

308
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,280
to Costco, many other stores.

309
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,270
Thank you for that.

310
00:15:59,270 --> 00:15:59,770
OK.

311
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,180
With that,
congratulations again.

312
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,800
And back to you,
Chris Capozzola.

313
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,500
Christopher Capozzola: All right.

314
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,170
Thanks to everyone in the Supply
Chain Management MicroMasters

315
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:11,690
program.

316
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,830
And congratulations to our
newest MicroMasters credential

317
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,700
holders.

318
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,250
And a special thanks
to Caroline and Tianxu

319
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,940
for sharing their stories.

320
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,350
Next, it's my privilege to
introduce Dr. Sara Ellison

321
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,500
and Thanh Nguyen from the
MIT Economics Department

322
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,760
and J-PAL, the Jameel
Poverty Action Lab.

323
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,460
They are leaders of the
MicroMasters and Data,

324
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,130
Economics, and Design of Policy.

325
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,100
Over to you, Sara.

326
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,340
Sara Ellison: Thanks, Chris.

327
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,675
I'm really happy
to be here today.

328
00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:46,020
Some of you may know that
long before I became director

329
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,400
of the DEDP program, even before
I collaborated on the MOOC that

330
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,060
is part of the program, I was
an industrial organization

331
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,670
economist who studied the
effect that the internet was

332
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,980
having on traditional markets.

333
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,980
And broadly speaking, I
found that the internet had

334
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,290
vast potential for
increasing social welfare,

335
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:08,190
and that's basically
economist speak

336
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,990
for making the world better.

337
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,450
But I also found that it also--

338
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:16,349
that it had potential for
decreasing social welfare.

339
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,359
We are all well
aware of examples

340
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,359
in our own personal lives of
how the internet has sometimes

341
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,770
not lived up to its
positive potential,

342
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,790
and has actually made
markets work less well,

343
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,790
or people worse off.

344
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,750
When I joined my colleagues
Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo,

345
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,920
and Ben Olken to work on
DEDP, I experienced up

346
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,460
close a powerful example,
though, of the positive effects

347
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,880
that internet
technologies can deliver.

348
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,670
And all of you are the proof.

349
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,330
You went online, and you sought
out these challenging courses

350
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,940
covering important topics.

351
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,550
You have worked
hard, deciphering

352
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:58,850
complicated equations,
working on p sets

353
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:03,050
late into the night, re-watching
videos until something finally

354
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,860
clicks, creating
community online.

355
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,050
And in doing so, you
have equipped yourself

356
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:14,360
with a toolkit to in turn help
improve the world for others.

357
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,580
Even given my years
of research, I'd

358
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,770
be hard pressed to think of a
better use for the internet.

359
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,710
So here we are, online
today to celebrate

360
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:29,240
these extraordinary
accomplishments of you,

361
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,550
our learners, who have earned
their MicroMasters credentials.

362
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,890
You have diverse backgrounds,
varying interests.

363
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,310
You come from
dozens of countries

364
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,490
and range widely in age.

365
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,600
But you have more in common
than what differentiates you--

366
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,750
your remarkable ability, your
hard work and persistence,

367
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,430
and your passion for making
the world a better place.

368
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,590
We are proud of you, but we
are also inspired by you.

369
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,080
It is a fondest hope of the
founders of the DEDP program,

370
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,650
one that I share as
well, that you will all

371
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,730
be part of a worldwide movement
of evidence-based policymaking

372
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,870
to improve government policy
in people's lives everywhere.

373
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,190
So that is my charge to you.

374
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,330
Use the knowledge and tools
you've acquired through the DEDP

375
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,240
MicroMasters to enrich your
life and further your career,

376
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,320
for sure, but also use
them to make the world

377
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,260
a better place for others.

378
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,820
Finally, speaking on behalf of
Thanh Nguyen, Brynn Fieldhouse,

379
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,700
and all of our extraordinary
faculty and staff

380
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,050
of the DEDP MicroMasters,
let me close by offering you

381
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,230
our warmest congratulations
and best of luck

382
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,240
in your future endeavors.

383
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,680
I will now turn it over to
Davis Heniford, the Education

384
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,040
Manager of our program,
for a few remarks.

385
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:54,540
Thanks.

386
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,340
Davis Heniford: Thank you so much, Sara.

387
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,680
It's always tough
to speak after you.

388
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,860
You do such a great job.

389
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,230
Honestly-- hello, everyone.

390
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:11,330
First of all, just
congratulations.

391
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,510
Everyone here, as Sara
said, has worked so hard.

392
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,070
Your dedication and
perseverance is inspiring,

393
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,990
and it's really my
pleasure to be here today.

394
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,910
It's just wonderful to see all
of the amazing learners who

395
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,760
have come so far and introduce
two incredible learners

396
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,140
from our program in particular.

397
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,200
But before I get to
that, I have a few words

398
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,580
to say about the DEDP
MicroMasters program.

399
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,680
Our mission is simple.

400
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,096
Empower cohorts of diverse,
exceptional individuals--

401
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,460
oh, excuse me-- with
the technical skills

402
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:52,170
to tackle poverty using
evidence-based approaches.

403
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:56,670
And you truly embody
that, all of you.

404
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,630
Our success is your success.

405
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,810
So here's a little bit of
information about all of you.

406
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:07,230
We launched our program
in 2017, and today,

407
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,990
you are over 365,000 strong.

408
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,070
You come from all around the
world with representation

409
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,090
from almost every country.

410
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,070
I don't want to belabor
the point too much,

411
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,250
but this is truly a
wide-reaching cohort.

412
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,970
You can see a bit more
about our demographics here.

413
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,740
One thing I particularly
like to highlight

414
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,830
is the fact that there is an
almost even split between those

415
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,060
of you who work in government,
NGOs, nonprofit organizations,

416
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:40,790
and for-profit organizations,
which I think is really special.

417
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,810
And now to celebrate you.

418
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:49,760
I'm so happy to announce that
230 new program credentials were

419
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,600
awarded this year.

420
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,180
Congrats to all
of you once again.

421
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,990
And as a quick final
message, I really

422
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,140
do hope you consider applying
for our master's program.

423
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,510
Honestly, nothing
would make me happier

424
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,417
than seeing you in Cambridge.

425
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,500
Of course, there are plenty
of other opportunities

426
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,460
for credential holders as well,
including our many pathways.

427
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:18,880
And on that note, just
thanks again once more.

428
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,500
It's truly a privilege
to work with you,

429
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,225
and congratulations, truly.

430
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:31,150
And now I have two learners--

431
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:35,060
credential holders now
to introduce to you.

432
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,770
I'm going to start
with Abdoul Aziz.

433
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,230
Abdoul Aziz grew
up in Niger, where

434
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:44,740
he witnessed the adverse
effects of poverty firsthand.

435
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,890
At a young age, he developed a
passion for tackling inequality.

436
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:51,530
As a researcher and
economic analyst,

437
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:55,090
he studied topics such as
youth socioeconomic outcomes

438
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,970
and the effect of child
care on female labor force

439
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,620
participation.

440
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,720
He will be joining the DEDP
master's program next year,

441
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,320
and he hopes to use the skills
he learned from the program

442
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,600
to address poverty
in sub-Saharan Africa

443
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,490
and create a more
equitable world

444
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,400
through evidence-based research.

445
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,550
Abdoul Aziz, please
take it away.

446
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,890
Abdoul Aziz: Hello, everyone.

447
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,850
My name is Abdoul Aziz,
and I'm from Niger.

448
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,210
I recently completed
my undergraduate degree

449
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:28,470
in economics at Altinbas
University in Turkey,

450
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:31,260
and I'm honored to
have been admitted

451
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,980
to the master's in Data
Economics and Design of Policy

452
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,900
at MIT.

453
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,450
Earlier this year, I completed
the DEDP MicroMasters program.

454
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,520
When I first
discovered the program,

455
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,100
I saw something that felt both
exciting and out of reach.

456
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,160
I was still adjusting
to life in a new country

457
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,765
and studying in a new
language, all during COVID-19,

458
00:23:57,765 --> 00:24:01,620
and I was unsure of
my academic abilities.

459
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,250
However, with a fresh
perspective, I took a chance,

460
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:09,130
and that decision changed
the course of my journey.

461
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,940
The program challenged
me to grow beyond what

462
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,990
I thought I was capable of.

463
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,850
It sharpened my thinking,
deepened my understanding

464
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,340
of data and policymaking,
and most importantly,

465
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,840
showed me that learning
is most powerful when it

466
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,470
serves people and communities.

467
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:32,590
To all my fellow credential
earners, congratulations.

468
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:35,320
You all took on a
demanding journey,

469
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,560
often while balancing
life's challenges.

470
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,640
You also come from different
countries and walks of life,

471
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,140
but you are united by
our shared commitment

472
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,975
to growth and learning.

473
00:24:48,975 --> 00:24:51,960
As we move forward,
let's carry what

474
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,500
we have learned not just
as knowledge, but as a tool

475
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,280
to make a real difference
wherever we are.

476
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,550
Congratulations again
to each of you, and best

477
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:06,185
wishes as you continue
writing your own stories.

478
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:08,340
Thank you.

479
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,620
Now back to Davis.

480
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,220
Davis Heniford: Thank you so much, Abdoul Aziz.

481
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,540
That was wonderful and
certainly tough to follow.

482
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,290
But I have to say, I'm
equally happy to introduce

483
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,570
Tejaswi Menda.

484
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:27,560
She truly is a veteran
learner, but also

485
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,330
someone I really
wanted to highlight

486
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,500
as a dynamic leader whose career
spans public service, media

487
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,620
innovation, and social impact.

488
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,530
Tejaswi is not only a first
generation student, but also

489
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,180
the first woman engineer
from her village.

490
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,220
Her career has spanned broadly.

491
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,920
In addition to
engineering, she worked

492
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,330
for a long time at the
Indian Information Service

493
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,840
where her goal was to
bridge gaps in opportunity

494
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,500
through the power
of information,

495
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,310
completing research on
topics like the efficacy

496
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,855
of communication strategies,
community health workers.

497
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:01,640
I'm going to do a little bit
more bragging here on you,

498
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,740
Tejaswi, if you don't
mind, because I just

499
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,160
saw that recently were promoted
to Joint Director of DD

500
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,810
News in India, which,
if I'm not mistaken,

501
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,510
brings in over 600
million viewers.

502
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,370
Beyond her professional
achievements, which are many,

503
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,110
Tejaswi is a passionate advocate
for education and community

504
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,590
welfare, founding a small
NGO which supports orphanages

505
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,760
and underserved students.

506
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,980
So on that note,
Tejaswi, take it away.

507
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,870
Tejaswi Menda: Thank you, Davis, for
the kind introduction.

508
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,810
Hello, everyone.

509
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,310
Namaste.

510
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,110
I am Tejaswi.

511
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,510
As Davis mentioned, I'm
a civil servant working

512
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,250
with government of India.

513
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,680
Prior to this, I worked
as a software engineer

514
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,980
for a couple of years.

515
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,970
So in my current role,
I've had the privilege

516
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,850
of working on various
interesting and challenging

517
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,660
assignments.

518
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,820
And I used to feel as if, you
know, something is lacking.

519
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,420
I wanted my work to be more
impactful and effective,

520
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,910
but I quite didn't know
what I was looking for.

521
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:05,650
And that's when I came
across the DEDP MicroMasters,

522
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,540
and my first course was The
Challenges of Global Poverty.

523
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,420
It was my introduction
to development economics

524
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,570
and research, and I just
fell in love with the field.

525
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:21,030
The possibility that the
world's most important

526
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,960
and often what seemed like small
but important questions could

527
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,410
be answered with the help of
rigorous and objective research

528
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,410
has been truly empowering.

529
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:36,450
I began to look at my day-to-day
work, issues, and challenges

530
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:40,570
as many potential RCT
experiments in my head.

531
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:43,320
I designed those
many RCTs in my head,

532
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,980
and it helped me zero in on more
better, effective solutions.

533
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,930
And I'm quite sure the learnings
I got from the MicroMasters

534
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,360
would help me as I
continue to take up

535
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,820
more challenging
assignments as a policymaker

536
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,800
and an administrator.

537
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,790
I also got the opportunity to
join the residential masters

538
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,890
at the MIT campus
for the DEDP, but due

539
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,570
to some personal
reasons, I couldn't

540
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,280
accept the offer of admission.

541
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,520
Still, I continue this journey
to be truly life changing.

542
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,510
As Davis mentioned, for someone
who grew up in rural India

543
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,330
and is a first-generation
graduate,

544
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:21,530
the DEDP MicroMasters
truly expanded

545
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,560
the vision of what's possible.

546
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,770
So here, I thank MIT
and the DEDP team

547
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,230
for making this happen.

548
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,840
The possibility-- the ability
to learn from world's best

549
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,450
professors sitting in my
bedroom, it was incredible.

550
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,160
So thank you, MIT.

551
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,350
And to all the fellow
MicroMaster credential earners

552
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,100
today, congratulations.

553
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,930
You deserve to be celebrated.

554
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,230
As a working mom, I
know how difficult

555
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,570
it is to complete
such a rigorous course

556
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,670
from an institute like
MIT, there or virtually.

557
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:58,050
I remember squeezing in some
lectures during my commute

558
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,990
or revising for exams while
putting my kids to sleep.

559
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,060
So I know how hard
you all worked,

560
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,590
so cheers to that,
and all the best.

561
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,930
All the best to everyone
on your continued journey.

562
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,080
So here's to perseverance
and to continuous learning.

563
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,620
Thank you.

564
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,120
Thank you for this
opportunity, MIT.

565
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,090
Davis Heniford: Thank you so much, Tejaswi.

566
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,400
Honestly, doing all of
that also while being

567
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,990
a mother, truly inspiring.

568
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,780
Fantastic.

569
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,010
I'm very happy to
pass it along now.

570
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,615
Thank you all, DEDP
credential holders.

571
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,490
Christopher Capozzola: All right.

572
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,990
Thank you, and congratulations
to this latest cohort

573
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,790
of MicroMasters
credential holders

574
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,770
in Data Economics and
the Design of Policy.

575
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:45,730
And thanks to Davis Heniford
and Professor Ellison

576
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,220
and to Abdoul and Tejaswi.

577
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,670
It's now my privilege to
introduce Professor David

578
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:56,590
Hardt, who, along with Dr. Aditi
Joshi of the MIT Mechanical

579
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,720
Engineering Department,
are the leaders

580
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,970
of our MicroMasters in the
Principles of Manufacturing.

581
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,685
Professor Hardt.

582
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,920
David Hart: Thank you, Chris.

583
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,310
And it's a pleasure
to get to address

584
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,730
this class of the Principles
of Manufacturing MicroMasters.

585
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:17,590
So let me add my
congratulations to you again

586
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:20,560
for completion of this
very rigorous program.

587
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,510
I want to remind
you that this is

588
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:25,930
identical to the
campus program that we

589
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,710
have for a full semester.

590
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,400
And I can tell you as well
that the students on campus

591
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,140
always find that semester
very challenging.

592
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,130
They also find it very
rewarding in the end.

593
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,830
And we believe the principles
that you've learned

594
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,700
will not only enable you to
become a leader in your field

595
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,250
in this exciting and vital
area of manufacturing,

596
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,210
but also enable you to
teach your colleagues how

597
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,270
to do so as well.

598
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,020
So we hope you'll be a
leader and a teacher based

599
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,630
on this, because you're
getting the real basics of it.

600
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,300
We look forward to hearing
about your accomplishments

601
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,920
in the future, and hope some of
you will consider coming to MIT,

602
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,550
applying for our program
in Advanced Manufacturing

603
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:10,320
and Design, whose regalia
I am wearing today.

604
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,900
And with that, I'll turn
it over to Professor Joshi,

605
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,710
who will tell you more
about our program.

606
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,810
Aditi Joshi: Thank you, Dave.

607
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,830
Hi, everyone.

608
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,310
My name is Dr.
Aditi Joshi, and I'm

609
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,990
the Program Lead for the
Principles of Manufacturing.

610
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,600
So firstly, I'm sure
you know what's coming.

611
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,080
Congratulations to all
the credential holders

612
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,410
and their loved ones.

613
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,430
And a special shout-out to
our cohort of the Principles

614
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,500
of Manufacturing.

615
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,180
This is my fifth year
at the celebration.

616
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,960
And like every year,
I really look forward

617
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,470
to the incredible stories that
all the learners share here.

618
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,640
We really admire the hard work,
the dedication that all of you

619
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,540
put into completing
this program,

620
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,070
and all the sacrifices
that also go into this.

621
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,780
A lot of credential
holders of our program,

622
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,430
which is Principles
of Manufacturing,

623
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:02,480
are working
professionals, which means

624
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,560
you are studying in the evenings
after a workday or at nights,

625
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,410
on the weekends,
taking leaves just

626
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,790
to be able to complete
a proctored exam.

627
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:15,210
And a lot of you also take
the exams at very odd hours,

628
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,360
just so you can get some
quiet time in the house,

629
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,320
and also you don't get flagged
for the background noise that

630
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,070
is generally there otherwise.

631
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:26,720
So we understand that a lot
of preparation and planning

632
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,830
goes into completing
this program.

633
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,420
So after that, I'm sure today
is a very special day for all

634
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,140
of you and your families.

635
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,620
And we are very excited
to be a part of it

636
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,850
and celebrate your achievements.

637
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,630
So congratulations
again to all of you.

638
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:45,470
I'm quickly going to share some
demographics of our learners.

639
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,710
So the Principles of
Manufacturing program has over

640
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:54,080
300,000 total enrollments,
out of which 7,400 are unique

641
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,560
verified enrollments.

642
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,880
The program now has a total
of 353 credential holders

643
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,365
from over 50 countries
across the globe.

644
00:33:05,365 --> 00:33:08,140
Our cohort of credential
holders is mostly

645
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:11,650
in the age group of 25
to 35, and a lot of you

646
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:16,460
are working professionals with a
bachelor's or a master's degree.

647
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,600
So some of you
continue your studies

648
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,300
while doing masters at MIT
or some other institutions.

649
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,710
And some of you take up
some new jobs, new roles,

650
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,250
and new responsibilities.

651
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,300
So we do want to give our
best wishes to all of you

652
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:35,560
for a very bright future
that's ahead of you.

653
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,630
I would also like to
take this opportunity

654
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,850
to thank the course
faculties who

655
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,570
have built these wonderful
courses, the MITx

656
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,400
team for their constant
support and assistance,

657
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,080
and our last-minute
panic emails, the old

658
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,630
and the current course
teams, which you might be

659
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,810
familiar with, and our wonderful
community TAs who voluntarily

660
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:01,380
help out their fellow learners
to complete and do well

661
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,470
in the courses.

662
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:03,610
Thank you, everyone.

663
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,360
Thank you for all your efforts.

664
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,690
So today, we have two of our
credentialed representatives

665
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,780
who will be sharing their
experiences with us.

666
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,219
Let's first hear from Lee
Nguyen. Over to you,

667
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,980
 Lee Nguyen.

668
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,900
Thank you, Professor Joshi.

669
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,260
Hello, everyone.

670
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,500
It's a great honor
to join you all today

671
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,520
to celebrate the completion of
MIT MicroMasters, especially

672
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,210
Principles of Manufacturing.

673
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,630
I have been working in
manufacturing and supply chain

674
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:34,889
for 17 years, leading digital
transformation projects where

675
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:39,780
automation, IoT, and AI are
becoming increasingly common.

676
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,489
But as I progressed
through this program,

677
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:47,620
I was reminded that before
applying advanced technology,

678
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,370
we must first master the
fundamental principles that

679
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,300
govern manufacturing systems.

680
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,920
For example, in the
Manufacturing Process Control

681
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,909
course with Professor
David Hardt,

682
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,500
I was inspired by how
statistical process control

683
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,800
helps critically evaluate
assumptions like how

684
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,390
to estimate mean and standard
deviation from limited or even

685
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,540
noisy data.

686
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,390
This approach not only
applies to manufacturing,

687
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:17,130
but also influence how I monitor
data-driven systems in my work.

688
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,580
For example, using
cumulative sums

689
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,940
to detect shift early in machine
learning model performance

690
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,430
and avoid feature drift.

691
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,010
In the Supply Chain for
Manufacturing course

692
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,760
with Professor Stephen Graves,
I gained a comprehensive view

693
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,480
of inventory management
from basic newsvendor models

694
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,710
to network-wide optimization
under uncertainty.

695
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,640
This helped me better understand
how inventory decisions impact

696
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,465
the entire supply chain
while meeting service levels.

697
00:35:47,465 --> 00:35:52,250
In practice, I believe it's easy
to collect large amount of data

698
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:57,750
through MIT and simulation and
to apply ready-made models.

699
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,530
But what this
program taught me is

700
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:04,670
that the true success comes
from understanding how system

701
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,470
behaves, how
variation propagates,

702
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:11,000
how flow is maintained,
and how every decision

703
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,715
impacts the broader operation.

704
00:36:13,715 --> 00:36:18,830
I'm deeply grateful to MIT,
the professor, the course team

705
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:21,150
for this enriching experience.

706
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,220
Congratulations to all of us.

707
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,960
I believe this knowledge will
serve us well for many years

708
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,720
to come.

709
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,080
Thank you so much.

710
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,397
Back to you, Professor Joshi.

711
00:36:32,397 --> 00:36:33,520
Thank you, Lee Nguyen.

712
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,060
Thank you for sharing your
experiences with us.

713
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,540
Our next credential holder
is Akshaya. Over

714
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,700
to you, Akshaya. 

715
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,670
Thank you, Aditi.

716
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,540
Hi, everyone.

717
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,990
I am Akshaya. I started
Principles of Manufacturing

718
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:52,030
Program right when I began my
first job as a manufacturing

719
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,480
engineer in India's first
private aircraft final assembly

720
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,590
line.

721
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,810
At the time, I was
curious to understand

722
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,770
how a product makes its journey
from paper to the production

723
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:03,735
line.

724
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:05,810
How do global
supply chains work?

725
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:08,290
How do systems come
together efficiently?

726
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,410
And what is
operational excellence?

727
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,650
This program answered those
questions and many I didn't even

728
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,850
know I had.

729
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,270
It wasn't always easy
balancing a full-time work

730
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,210
with coursework.

731
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,450
It meant late nights
and early mornings,

732
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:25,490
and sometimes doubts about
whether I could do it.

733
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,310
But like many of
you, I kept going.

734
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,340
And that brought me
here with a belief

735
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:34,000
that learning can open doors
that we don't even see yet.

736
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,120
In fact, I started this
journey in one country

737
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,610
and completed it from another.

738
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,960
That shift wasn't
just geographical.

739
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,070
It reflected how much I
had grown both personally

740
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,945
and professionally.

741
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:50,680
To the professors and support
staff, thank you very much.

742
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,650
To my fellow learners
from all around the world,

743
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,650
sharing this virtual
space with you

744
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,115
reminded me that
curiosity is universal

745
00:37:59,115 --> 00:38:01,750
and growth doesn't stop
with a certificate.

746
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,585
It starts with it.

747
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:06,190
As we all move forward
into new roles,

748
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,590
new industries, or
even new countries,

749
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:11,145
congratulations to all of us.

750
00:38:11,145 --> 00:38:12,085
Over to you, Chris.

751
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,880
Christopher Capozzola: All right.

752
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,230
Thank you to everyone
in our cohort

753
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,930
from the Principles of
Manufacturing MicroMasters

754
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,250
credential.

755
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,000
Thanks to Aditi and Dave Hardt,
to Lee Nguyen and Akshaya.

756
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,320
And it's now
my pleasure to introduce Dr.

757
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,770
Karene Chu from MIT's Institute
for Data, Systems, and Society.

758
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:41,100
Karene is a leader in
our MicroMasters program

759
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,795
in Statistics and Data Science.

760
00:38:42,795 --> 00:38:43,295
Karene?

761
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,120
Karene Chu: Thank you, Chris.

762
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,600
Congratulations, everyone,
on achieving the MicroMasters

763
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,770
program credential in Statistics
and Data Science to all 285

764
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,270
of you.

765
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,440
Just as everyone
before me have said,

766
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,090
we acknowledge the tremendous
commitment, determination,

767
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,160
and focus that you
have demonstrated

768
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,900
in these significant
accomplishments,

769
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,520
regardless of where you are,
what environment you're under,

770
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,420
and what other
commitments you have.

771
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,580
So in this age of
AI, we always ask,

772
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,580
do we still need our
foundational data science

773
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,160
skills?

774
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,670
So I want to highlight
that what you have learned

775
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:31,310
is still completely, if not
more, useful in this age of AI.

776
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,540
First, when AI model
predicts outcome,

777
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,800
we know that they do so
based on probabilities

778
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,980
rather than certainties.

779
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,940
So understanding how to
interpret these probabilities

780
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,770
is crucial to making
informed decisions.

781
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,620
And with this
nuanced understanding

782
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,830
that you now
possess, you will be

783
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,120
careful in interpreting
AI outputs,

784
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,230
leading to reliable decisions
and appropriate confidence

785
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,910
in the results.

786
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:58,810
And as our MicroMasters faculty
director, Professor Devavrat

787
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:02,800
asked, why do we still teach
basic mathematics when we have

788
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,000
tools that can do it for us?

789
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,680
And the answer's clear, because
foundational skills are still

790
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,650
essential.

791
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,380
Children around
the world continue

792
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,650
to learn math in school because
these foundational concepts are

793
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,585
vital, even in a world dominated
by really advanced technology.

794
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:22,660
So while generative AI
automates specific tasks,

795
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,060
effectively using
these powerful tools

796
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:30,505
require the deep understanding
of where and how to apply it.

797
00:40:30,505 --> 00:40:33,400
You are now armed with
these foundational skills

798
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,040
necessary for analyzing,
evaluating, implementing,

799
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,640
and performing research
on complex data science

800
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,565
models and methods.

801
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:45,190
We expect that you will use
these skills and knowledge

802
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,740
to make progress in
your field of interest

803
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,515
and for the good
of your society.

804
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:56,821
So now let me present some
stats and tell you-- recount

805
00:40:56,821 --> 00:41:02,650
what you have done
in this MicroMasters.

806
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,945
Let me share my screen.

807
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:16,840
I bring with me the greetings
from all the faculty

808
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,840
in this program and our faculty
director, Devavrat Shah,

809
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,750
along with all of the
course team members.

810
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,520
We are all very proud
of your accomplishments.

811
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,890
The MicroMasters in
Statistics and Data Science

812
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,320
come out of IDSS, the Institute
for Data, Systems, and Society.

813
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:39,160
And our mission is to advance
complex societal challenges

814
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,660
by advancing education
and research that

815
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,290
is at the intersection
of statistics,

816
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:47,700
data science, information,
and decision systems.

817
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,380
And hence, the MicroMasters
is a very important part

818
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,350
of this mission.

819
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,290
We have other programs
in our institute,

820
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:03,960
including this PhD in Social
Engineering Systems, which

821
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,620
is a pathway for this
MicroMasters program.

822
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,910
The MicroMasters program,
as you already all know,

823
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:16,890
covers four pillars of
data science, everything

824
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:20,310
that our faculty think is
necessary for a practitioner

825
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,830
in this day and age.

826
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:26,700
And with your
credential right now, we

827
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,610
look forward to hearing
stories about advancement

828
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:31,470
in your career.

829
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:36,300
Of course, applying your skills
everywhere that you can see fit.

830
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:41,250
And also, if you pursue an
academic degree afterwards,

831
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,090
there are more than
30 universities that

832
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,310
are pathways for this program.

833
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:51,860
And also, as I mentioned,
the MIT IDSS PhD

834
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,910
program in Social and
Engineering Systems.

835
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:59,330
So congratulations on having
this credential, and hope

836
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:03,695
that this will help
you be a vital--

837
00:43:03,695 --> 00:43:06,650
hold a vital role in society.

838
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:11,690
To recount, I think you all
know that you have completed

839
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,790
the full courses
that are equivalent

840
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,430
to graduate-level courses in
statistics and data science

841
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:19,047
at MIT on campus.

842
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:22,820
You have done more than 15--

843
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:29,485
10 to 15 hours of work per
week and 200 hours per course.

844
00:43:29,485 --> 00:43:34,430
These include 80 full professor
lectures and working on more

845
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:37,130
than 1,000 challenging problems.

846
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,480
These include from really
maybe simple concept

847
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,090
checks all the way
to full machine

848
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:46,452
learning tasks and projects.

849
00:43:46,452 --> 00:43:49,370
And at the end, you also
completed the proctored exam,

850
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,290
which includes eight
hours of exams.

851
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:55,160
So congratulations on
this huge accomplishment.

852
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:01,000
And now, here are
some statistics

853
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,520
of our credential holders.

854
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,440
Our program is
now six years old,

855
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:13,100
and you are part of our more
than 1,800 credential holders.

856
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,486
There's 195 countries
represented.

857
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:26,030
Our program has around
80% male and 17% female.

858
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:31,060
We would like more female
to join our program.

859
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,720
This is our age distribution.

860
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,970
It's a big range, mainly
between 25 to 54 here,

861
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:43,860
reflecting that you are working
professionals, generally.

862
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:47,410
A lot of you hold a bachelor's
degree and a master's degree,

863
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,560
and some of you also
hold a doctorate degree.

864
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,935
And we have also 6% of high
school students joining us.

865
00:44:55,935 --> 00:45:00,390
And the industries, the top 10
industries are plotted here.

866
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:03,540
A lot of you are in the
information and technology

867
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,770
space.

868
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:08,380
Computer software, banking,
financial services,

869
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,920
telecommunication, management,
consulting, higher education,

870
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,370
et cetera.

871
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,810
This is our map of
credential holders.

872
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:20,670
In total right now in North
America, there's around 500.

873
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:23,420
South America, 400.

874
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:28,530
It's sort of roughly spread
out around the whole world.

875
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:33,130
And here is also a map of
all our pathway school,

876
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,650
which is also spread
around the globe.

877
00:45:39,245 --> 00:45:40,650
I will not say more.

878
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,780
I will want to look forward
to hearing from you about how

879
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,730
you're going to
use your knowledge

880
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:51,680
and use this credential in
your career, in your research,

881
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,260
in your own projects.

882
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,390
And we'll hear from
one of the learners who

883
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:59,060
have done volunteer work as
well, using his data science

884
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,760
skills.

885
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,970
And last but not least, I
want to thank our IDSS team

886
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:09,980
and Open Learning staff,
Susana, Jeremy, Erica from IDSS,

887
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:17,760
and Dana, David, Shelly,
Lana, Peter, Liou, Tim.

888
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,740
I mean, all of these people
are vital to the well-being

889
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,360
and the smooth running
of our program,

890
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,230
so we really want to
thank you for making

891
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:30,095
our program a success.

892
00:46:30,095 --> 00:46:33,080
And finally, our community TAs.

893
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:40,160
You are making everyone's
experience online much better

894
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,450
for us, course team,
and for other learners.

895
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:46,805
So we really thank you for
your dedication and time

896
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:49,800
to involve in the course,
talking to other people.

897
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,510
And I hope that these
communications and networks

898
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,340
that you've built
throughout the course

899
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:00,200
will continue
beyond the program.

900
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,240
So finally,
congratulations once more.

901
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,320
I would like to
introduce now Jeff

902
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,880
as our next speaker,
who I'm going

903
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,730
to introduce to you right away.

904
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:18,470
So Jefff is a statistician
with a strong background

905
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:21,570
in data analytics, statistical
modeling, data science,

906
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,570
and economic research.

907
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,770
Deeply passionate about
research, innovation,

908
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:28,320
and the application of data
science to public policy,

909
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,770
Jeff has also led
several volunteer initiatives

910
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:32,850
in technology and education.

911
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,900
He actively contributes to
programming and AI communities

912
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,970
and is committed
to leveraging data

913
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:41,960
to solve complex challenges,
particularly those affecting

914
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,500
emerging economies.

915
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,970
Take it away, Jeff.

916
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:47,730
Jeff: Hello, everyone.

917
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:49,520
It's truly an honor
to be here today,

918
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,500
celebrating this
incredible milestone

919
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,220
with so many brilliant
minds from around the world.

920
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,650
When I began the
MITx MicroMasters

921
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:01,820
in Statistics and Data Science,
I was driven by a deep desire

922
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:05,750
to use data not just for
numbers, but for impact.

923
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,120
Coming from Haiti,
I've seen firsthand

924
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:13,010
how communities often
face major challenges,

925
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:16,200
not because they lack
intelligence or willpower,

926
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,870
because they lack access to
resources, to opportunities,

927
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:24,620
and to the language
of technology.

928
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,170
This program
changed that for me.

929
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,540
It gave me not only the
technical foundation

930
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:34,120
in data science, statistics,
and machine learning,

931
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,700
but also the confidence
to apply it meaningfully.

932
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,510
I've used what I learned to
build dashboards for COVID-19

933
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:45,600
analysis, develop
financial analytics platform,

934
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,320
and design a text-to-speech
system in Haitian Creole,

935
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,390
making technology
more accessible

936
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,330
to underserved communities.

937
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,640
The MicroMasters
didn't just teach me

938
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,550
how to model data
or build algorithms.

939
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:05,370
It empowered me to turn complex,
unstructured information

940
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:09,990
into actionable insight
and social impact.

941
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,120
But the journey wasn't easy.

942
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,940
Like many of you, I
balanced this program

943
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:18,180
with work, projects, and life.

944
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:22,110
There were late nights,
setbacks, and doubts.

945
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:26,220
Yet, we kept showing up because
what we are building here

946
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,130
is bigger than us.

947
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,990
It's a community
of problem solvers,

948
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:36,380
changemakers, and people who
care deeply about using data

949
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,570
to drive progress.

950
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:41,810
So today, I'm not just
part of the certificate.

951
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:45,290
I'm part of the
persistence, the resilience,

952
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,440
and the purpose behind it.

953
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,200
And I'm incredibly
grateful to the MIT team

954
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,360
for creating a program
that truly opens doors,

955
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,550
regardless of where you live
or what your background is.

956
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:03,440
I also want to thank all our
professors and CTAs.

957
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,010
To my fellow graduates,
congratulations.

958
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:11,120
Let's keep using what we learned
to lift up others, transform

959
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:15,230
systems, and write stories
that truly inspire.

960
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:16,140
Thank you.

961
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:20,120
And now I'll hand it
back to you, Dr. Karene.

962
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,218
Karene Chu: Thank you, Jeff.

963
00:50:22,218 --> 00:50:28,190
Next, we will have Moumita Ghosh.
She is raised in a tranquil coastal state of India.

964
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,550
She's a PhD student specializing
in predictive modeling,

965
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,860
reinforcement learning,
and optimization.

966
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:37,250
She pairs her love for
algorithms with a poetic soul,

967
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:39,710
crafting poems and haikus
when she's not coding.

968
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:44,710
So both Jeff and Moumita
completed the general track

969
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,430
of this MicroMasters program.

970
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:48,495
So, Moumita, all yours.

971
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:55,690
Moumita Ghosh: Thank you so much, Dr. Karene,
for such a warm welcome to me.

972
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:56,810
So hello, everyone.

973
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:57,830
I am Moumita Ghosh.

974
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,710
I'm a PhD student.

975
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:02,560
I'm currently pursuing
my PhD focusing

976
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,110
on reinforcement
learning, optimization,

977
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:06,560
and predictive modeling.

978
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,060
And recently, I have completed
MicroMasters in Statistics

979
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:12,490
and Data Science from MIT.

980
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:15,070
Though I have a
background in engineering

981
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:18,050
with both a bachelor's
and master's in the field,

982
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:21,640
but my growing inspiration in
the machine learning and data

983
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:24,590
science led me to
seek a new direction.

984
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:29,830
So what inspired that
transition was witnessing

985
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:33,400
the remarkable impact of
machine learning and data

986
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,500
science in various fields,
especially in health care.

987
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:39,680
So as I was looking for
a career transition,

988
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,375
I wanted my first step correct.

989
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:47,120
And also, I firmly believe
that to excel in any field,

990
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:51,010
it is very essential to have a
solid foundation in that field

991
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:51,680
first.

992
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,000
So this MicroMasters
program not only offered us

993
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,080
a rigorous and very
practical approach

994
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,630
to handle the problems
in data science,

995
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:05,030
but also significantly
advanced my research,

996
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:07,870
and it helped me
develop my portfolio

997
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:09,560
with some solid projects.

998
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,970
So all these experiences
have laid the groundwork

999
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:16,840
for my dream of entering into
the data science industry

1000
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,560
as my full-time career.

1001
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,660
And most importantly,
I had the privilege

1002
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,850
of learning from the
best people in the world.

1003
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,450
And for that, I
am and will always

1004
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,850
be sincerely grateful to MIT.

1005
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:32,430
And finally, I
would like to extend

1006
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:35,790
my heartfelt congratulations
and best wishes

1007
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,770
to all the learners at MIT.

1008
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:41,020
So here is to our continued
growth and success.

1009
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:41,675
Thank you.

1010
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,720
Christopher Capozzola: All right.

1011
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,700
Thank you to Moumita and
Jeff. And congratulations

1012
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,220
to the latest cohort in
Statistics and Data Science

1013
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,710
MicroMasters.

1014
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:58,770
It's now my pleasure
to introduce

1015
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:01,630
Dr. Egor Matveyev from MIT Sloan.

1016
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:04,170
Egor is one of the leaders
of our MicroMasters

1017
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:05,680
program in Finance.

1018
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,160
Take it away.

1019
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,390
Egor Matveyev: Thank you, Chris.

1020
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:12,750
Let me start by congratulating
all MicroMasters credential

1021
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:16,230
holders, and especially the
graduates of the Finance

1022
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,610
MicroMasters.

1023
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:20,690
Congratulations on this
remarkable achievement.

1024
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:23,750
I'm Egor Matveyev, Executive
Director of the MicroMasters

1025
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:25,100
program in Finance.

1026
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:30,005
I have been part of
this journey since 2019,

1027
00:53:30,005 --> 00:53:34,340
and have had the privilege of
leading the program since 2020.

1028
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:38,030
This year marks five years
since the launch of the program.

1029
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:40,550
It has been an
incredible journey.

1030
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,560
To share more about
what we have built,

1031
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,390
I have prepared a few slides.

1032
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,510
The idea behind the program
was bold, but simple--

1033
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:53,750
to open MIT finance
to the world.

1034
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:58,370
We set out to offer the same
level of academic excellence

1035
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:03,330
that defines MIT Sloan, and to
make it accessible to everyone,

1036
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,375
everywhere.

1037
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:08,935
We're incredibly proud
of what we have built.

1038
00:54:08,935 --> 00:54:13,580
More than 130,000 learners
have engaged with the content

1039
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,610
of our courses.

1040
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:18,680
Dedicating nearly
500,000 hours to study,

1041
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,090
this is the equivalent of 57
years of continuous collective

1042
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,800
learning.

1043
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,350
Earning the MicroMasters
credential in Finance

1044
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,120
is no small feat.

1045
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:29,950
To complete the
program, learners

1046
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:33,710
must take the full set of
core courses from MIT Sloan's

1047
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:36,680
top-ranked Master of
Finance curriculum,

1048
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,360
along with one
advanced elective.

1049
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,680
Together, these courses
include more than 90 hours

1050
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,710
of instruction.

1051
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:49,100
Each module demands 10
to 14 hours of work.

1052
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:52,010
With more than 50
modules in total,

1053
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:55,480
this commitment ends up to
the equivalent of three months

1054
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,640
of full-time study.

1055
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,340
And it is not just about
watching lectures and doing

1056
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,010
homework.

1057
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:02,860
To earn the credential,
learners must

1058
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:08,260
pass the same rigorous exams we
give to our students on campus.

1059
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:12,670
That level of academic challenge
means only a select few make it

1060
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:15,640
to the finish line.

1061
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:20,070
Today, we proudly recognize
273 exceptional individuals

1062
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:25,210
who have mastered all the
content, passed all the exams,

1063
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:28,980
and learned their place
as credential holders.

1064
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,710
We're incredibly proud of them.

1065
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:35,880
Our credential holders come from
62 countries around the world,

1066
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,030
with the United States,
India, and the United Kingdom

1067
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:42,900
accounting for about
1/3 of the total.

1068
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,740
The map on this slide gives
you a sense of how broad

1069
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,740
our geographic reach is.

1070
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:55,080
This is truly a global
community of learners.

1071
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,850
Our community of
credential holders

1072
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:59,160
is as diverse in
professional background

1073
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,200
as it is in geography.

1074
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:06,610
They work at central banks,
such as Central Bank of Peru,

1075
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:10,140
the Bank of Thailand, and
the National Bank of Georgia.

1076
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:14,020
Others serve in market
regulatory agencies,

1077
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,590
including the Securities and
Exchange Commission of Brazil

1078
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:20,160
and Japan's Financial
Services Agency.

1079
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,890
You will also find them at
hedge funds, proprietary trading

1080
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:26,680
firms, and asset managers like
Fidelity, Millennium Management,

1081
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,950
Two Sigma, as well
as global banks

1082
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:31,590
and consulting firms such as
Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs,

1083
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:34,095
and BCG.

1084
00:56:34,095 --> 00:56:36,720
And this is just a glimpse
of many organizations

1085
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,450
where our graduates
are making an impact.

1086
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:44,220
Now before I wrap up,
I want to acknowledge

1087
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:47,290
the many people who have
made this program possible.

1088
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:51,400
Our faculty, staff, Open
Learning colleagues,

1089
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,430
teaching assistants,
and the learners

1090
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:56,850
who serve this community,
teaching assistants.

1091
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:59,020
This has truly been
a collective effort,

1092
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:04,672
and I am deeply grateful to
everyone who contributed.

1093
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:06,630
Now I am pleased to
welcome our Finance learner

1094
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:10,380
representatives, My-Ni Pham
and Mauricio Hernandez.

1095
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,910
We will first hear from
My-Ni, followed by Mauricio.

1096
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,655
My-Ni, the floor is yours.

1097
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:21,050
My-Ni Pham: Thank you, Egor.

1098
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:22,560
Good morning, everyone.

1099
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,950
My name is My-Ni,
and it's very honor

1100
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:29,180
to speak on behalf
of Finance cohort

1101
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:33,370
at this MIT MicroMasters
celebration.

1102
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:37,820
As a quantitative analyst,
I joined the MIT MicroMaster

1103
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:42,200
in finance with the background
in technology and strong passion

1104
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,350
to deepen my expertise.

1105
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:49,430
This program not only
enriched my understanding

1106
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:54,050
of financial theory,
but also the--

1107
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:59,095
but also inspired me impact on
the [INAUDIBLE] finance journey.

1108
00:57:59,095 --> 00:58:02,810
I'm thrilled to share with you
all that I also passed the Level

1109
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:07,190
1 of CFA program in
February, just a few months

1110
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:11,350
after completing
the MIT MicroMaster.

1111
00:58:11,350 --> 00:58:14,770
One of the most valuable
outcome from this course

1112
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:19,180
is that now I can apply the
knowledge of financial modeling

1113
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,600
in derivative market
directly to my work

1114
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:27,190
at Tuan Loc Commodities,
a commodities trading

1115
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:29,560
company in Vietnam.

1116
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:35,350
And first, I would like to say
thank you to the MIT professor.

1117
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:39,820
They are truly
inspiring teachers.

1118
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:45,790
They made many tough
concepts accessible and more

1119
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:47,805
than just the
financial knowledge.

1120
00:58:47,805 --> 00:58:51,790
They inspired me to
become a lifelong learner.

1121
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:55,660
And I also want to
express my gratitude

1122
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:59,770
to my boss, Mr. Kevin.
He is the one who

1123
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,880
introduced me this program.

1124
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:07,060
He encouraged me, supported
me every step of the way.

1125
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:10,890
A special thanks to my
amazing learning partner, Mr. Jung.

1126
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:15,870
I cannot remember
how many cups of coffee or how

1127
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:22,500
many late night study sessions
we spent to motivate each other

1128
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,480
to keep moving forward
and complete this course.

1129
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,950
And finally, we did it, and you
are truly a dear friend of mine.

1130
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:33,510
And to the MIT team,
thank you for creating

1131
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:37,350
such a wonderful program.

1132
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:42,150
And finally, to all of
you, congratulations.

1133
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:48,640
You did it, and hope you the
best on your career ahead.

1134
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,850
Thank you.

1135
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:53,340
Egor Matveyev: Thank you, and
congratulations, My-Ni.

1136
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,730
Next, I'd like to invite
Mao Hernandez to share

1137
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:57,700
his remarks.

1138
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,750
Mao?

1139
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,520
Mao Hernandez: Thank you, Professor Egor.

1140
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,550
Hello, everyone.

1141
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:07,340
So first of all, as one of the
speakers for the Finance cohort.

1142
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:08,840
I just want to take
this opportunity

1143
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,960
to say thank you to the
humans behind the scenes that

1144
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,630
really made these online courses
successful, like many of us.

1145
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:18,110
So thank you for
the TAs for engaging

1146
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:20,310
with our endless questions.

1147
01:00:20,310 --> 01:00:22,010
Thank you for the
staff answering

1148
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:25,830
some of our frenetic emails,
especially during the exams.

1149
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,220
Of course, thank you to the
professors for the classes

1150
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,280
and the content.

1151
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,190
So on behalf of the
MicroMasters Finance cohort,

1152
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,420
I just want to say thank you.

1153
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,740
If we all came to
MITx MicroMasters

1154
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:40,070
because of the brand name
and quality we would expect,

1155
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:44,480
we actually stayed because of
the people that made it happen.

1156
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,370
And as Professor Egor said, my
name is Mao Hernandez.

1157
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:49,890
I was born and raised
in Sao Paulo in Brazil.

1158
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:52,040
But actually, I've
been living in Tokyo

1159
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,600
in Japan for the past 15 years.

1160
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,970
After my master's
in pure mathematics,

1161
01:00:56,970 --> 01:01:00,000
I came to Japan to do my
PhD in computer science.

1162
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,780
I finished my studies
10 years or so ago

1163
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,990
and went to work in the
finance industry here in Japan.

1164
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,832
The MicroMasters
in Finance really

1165
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:09,790
was a really-- just a
really good excuse for me

1166
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:11,290
to go back to study.

1167
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:13,570
And I just want to share
one of the skills I think

1168
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:16,403
I'm going to take for life
that I learned in the course,

1169
01:01:16,403 --> 01:01:17,320
and it's essentially--

1170
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,290
I really feel like I learned
how to identify and evaluate

1171
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:21,260
options.

1172
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,070
What do I mean?

1173
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:23,860
Real-life options, right?

1174
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:26,390
I know that sounds
silly, but to be honest,

1175
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:28,060
a common option that
I need to choose

1176
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,850
in this stage in my
career is which company

1177
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:32,330
I'm going to help next.

1178
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:33,940
I use these skills
from the course

1179
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:37,550
every time I've been negotiating
a contract with companies.

1180
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:40,300
So the questions I learned
in the course actually

1181
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,620
can apply in my life, right?

1182
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,700
So what is the volatility
of this new company?

1183
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,500
What is the beta of the company?

1184
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,310
What should be the
expected rate of return

1185
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:49,700
for this risk investment?

1186
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,210
Emotional, time investment
that I need to do.

1187
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:55,570
As we all learned in the
course, volatility has a price,

1188
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:58,120
and I may or may not
be willing to pay.

1189
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:02,270
So my fellow MicroMasters in
Finance certificate earners,

1190
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:06,230
congratulations to you and your
family for this achievement.

1191
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:09,320
If you ever make your way
to Japan, sake is on me.

1192
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,860
But you better tell me amazing
stories from your achievements

1193
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:15,910
that I know you're
going to bring with you.

1194
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,840
Thank you.

1195
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,000
Professor Egor, the
floor is yours back.

1196
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,690
Egor Matveyev: Yes. Mao,
thank you so much.

1197
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,785
And I'll turn it
back over to Chris.

1198
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:27,300
Christopher Capozzola: All right.

1199
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:27,980
So thanks.

1200
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:31,040
Congratulations to the
latest cohort of MicroMasters

1201
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,610
credential holders in Finance.

1202
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:34,650
Thanks to My-Ni
and to Mao.

1203
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:38,400
And we will all take you up on
your offer of sake in Tokyo,

1204
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,410
I'm sure someday.

1205
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:41,240
We look forward to that.

1206
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,870
We're coming to the close of
our ceremony this morning,

1207
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:47,690
this afternoon, this evening.

1208
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:51,020
And I wanted to thank all of you
who are joining us and watching

1209
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:54,830
remotely online, because I
realize that many of you who

1210
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:57,800
are watching are staying
up late to watch,

1211
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,140
getting up early to watch,
interfering with your day,

1212
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:04,710
missing time with your family to
watch and support our credential

1213
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:06,180
holders, learners.

1214
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,100
And that's exactly what our
MicroMasters learners have done.

1215
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,040
You are people who
are willing to stay

1216
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:14,910
up late, to get up early, to
make many sacrifices to pursue

1217
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:18,990
this credential and to achieve
it, which you have done.

1218
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:21,660
Together, you have put
in the time that makes

1219
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:23,410
online learning meaningful.

1220
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:25,810
You have connected
with your instructors.

1221
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:30,060
You have connected with your
fellow learners, so thank you.

1222
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,670
Not only congratulations,
but thank you

1223
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:36,030
for making this learning
experience real, not only

1224
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:37,840
for yourself, but for others.

1225
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:41,760
You are fundamentally,
in the end, a community.

1226
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,150
And now as you have
built this community,

1227
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,650
you depart in many
different directions,

1228
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:49,870
as we've heard today,
all around the world.

1229
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:52,990
And I hope you will continue to
stay in touch with each other,

1230
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:56,340
with the entire MicroMasters
community, and with all of us

1231
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:59,220
here on campus at MIT.

1232
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:02,540
Many of our credential holders
have started already pursuing

1233
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:07,700
master's degrees at MIT or
at one of our 220 Pathway

1234
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:13,140
programs, which are found at 58
universities in 32 countries.

1235
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:17,000
Now, if the Pathway program to
MIT or another partner school

1236
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,500
is something you're interested
in learning more about,

1237
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,680
please visit our
MicroMasters website

1238
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,110
to explore the many options.

1239
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,860
And with that, congratulations
again to everyone, from me

1240
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:30,350
and for all of us here at MIT.

1241
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:33,470
We will close today's ceremony
by honoring each of you

1242
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:39,650
individually by sharing all of
the names of this year's 1,267

1243
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:43,250
MicroMasters credential
recipients on the screen.

1244
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:47,750
Congratulations again from
all of us here at MIT.

1245
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,250
Thank you.

1246
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:52,600
