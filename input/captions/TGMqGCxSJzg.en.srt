00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,359
So today we're [music] going to be doing

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,359
one of two lectures on the topic of

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,280
recursion. And it's a programming

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,000
technique and a way to algorithmically

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,200
solve problems. It's not something that

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
it's going to come easy because it's

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,480
going to force our brain to think about

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,400
problems that we've seen in a completely

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,080
different way. I'm just warning you,

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,760
it's going to take a little bit of kind

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,840
of forgetting everything we've learned.

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,080
To help you, we will have an interactive

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,840
portion of [music] today's lecture. So,

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,000
think about whether you want to come up

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,320
on stage. You'll be forever immortalized

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,160
in on the open courseware. Um, awesome.

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,840
I love it. On the open courseware

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,760
videos.
