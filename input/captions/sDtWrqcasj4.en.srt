judges. And what's going to happen?

51
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,959
We're going to see a presentation from

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,280
each of the finalists. It's going to be

53
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,519
13 minutes long and then there will be a

54
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,120
9-minute question period. Um well, I'll

55
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,720
hand the mic. Rules for the question

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,080
period, only one question, no

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,239
follow-ups. We're going to try to get as

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,440
many questions in as possible and keep

59
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:47,280
it clean and

60
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:49,440
uh and yeah, and then the judges will um

61
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,560
retire. I'm thinking the retiring will

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,720
take place at around 8:15 or 8:10 and

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
then we'll come back at 8:20 and we will

64
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,120
have a winner and the presentation of a

65
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,720
winner. So, we'll hopefully be done in

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,879
about an hour and 45 minutes this whole

67
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,400
thing. So, please stay for the

68
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,400
announcement of the winner.
