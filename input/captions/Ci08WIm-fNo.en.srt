00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,600
when you fuse this world of biology with

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,839
the world of electronics to read out

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:09,559
information from the body for health

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,200
monitoring or write information into the

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:15,000
body for Therapeutics the major

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,119
challenge in the field is bioelectronic

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,039
devices are highly invasive imagine a

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,840
new paradigm where we can have tiny Nano

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,039
electronic devices introduced into the

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,840
blast stream or body fluid and recognize

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:34,520
a Target disease region and self implant

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:37,320
these devices have the capability of

13
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,840
communicating wirelessly with external

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,120
transmitters so this could lead us to

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,200
early disease detection but they can

16
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,480
also modulate biological functions for

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,480
Therapeutics purposes our technology can

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,199
actually treat these brain cancers where

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,039
traditional therapies have failed for

20
00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:01,039
