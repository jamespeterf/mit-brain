1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,439
now please welcome Professor Andre Su

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:11,280
associate professor of urban science and

3
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:14,599
the planning at MIT to discuss the urban

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,160
network analysis

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:21,160
framework Professor Su please hi

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,840
everyone um I hope you can hear me okay

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,039
yeah it's a pleasure to join you all

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,199
today uh thank you ILP for the

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,359
invitation and uh hello to everybody on

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,759
the

11
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,320
webinar I will be disc discussing today

12
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,680
uh research we have been doing at the

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,200
city form lab in the department of urban

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,920
studies and planning at MIT around green

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,920
mobility in

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,920
cities as many of you probably know the

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,600
transportation sector Remains the

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,160
highest contributor to CO2 emissions in

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,600
cities roughly one third of all CO2

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,719
emissions in the industrialized world

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,280
come from transportation and if you zoom

22
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,119
in to that on the right hand side here

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,640
then you can see that the bulk of this

24
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:09,840
comes from light duty ve Vehicles which

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,240
is regular people driving to places on a

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,240
daily

27
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,439
basis however if we examine how

28
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,320
individual cities contribute to CO2

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,479
emissions from the Transportation sector

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,840
then a really interesting picture

31
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:30,600
emerges here I have plotted on the xaxis

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,280
the CO2 emissions per capita

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,759
from the Transportation sector and on

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,920
the Y AIS the density the population

35
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:43,920
density of a city and what we can see

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,399
are couple of really important takeaways

37
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,880
of this relationship first there is a

38
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,960
big difference that systemically varies

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,280
in terms of CO2 emissions and density in

40
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,320
the densest cities in the United States

41
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,719
emissions are in the order of two to

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,759
three tons of CO2 per person per year

43
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,600
and in the lower density cities like on

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,959
the far right of this chart in noxville

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,400
Tennessee or Charleston South Carolina

46
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,000
we have over 10 tons of CO2 emissions

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,160
per capita from the Transportation

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,480
sector what this

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:26,319
emphasizes is that City design the way a

50
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,680
city is spatially configured how dense

51
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,640
it is what um opportunities for travel

52
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,599
it offers without a

53
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,599
car has a huge implications on Urban

54
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:41,239
sustainability and our ability as

55
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:44,360
Society to tackle climate

56
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:47,800
change as an example people here in

57
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,640
Boston area where we are based a typical

58
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,519
person emits two 2.6 tons per year and

59
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,360
the person in Houston Texas emits about

60
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,920
N9 and a half tons this is not because

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,280
people fundamentally want different

62
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,360
things or are different people it's

63
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,319
because the city incentivizes us to

64
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,640
travel that way so City design plays a

65
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,360
critical role when it comes to

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,799
decarbonization and that is one of the

67
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,400
key reasons I will be talking about

68
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,840
Green Mobility

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,200
today and I want to emphasize that City

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,000
design does not only influence emissions

71
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,560
from the Transportation sector the same

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,640
relationship also translates to building

73
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,159
energy emissions building energy

74
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,519
emissions constitute another third of

75
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,360
all CO2 emissions at also energy

76
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,680
consumption in cities and if I change on

77
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,680
the x-axis what is being plotted from

78
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,959
CO2 per capita to residential energy

79
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,280
consumption megawatts per capita per

80
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,799
year we basically see a very similar

81
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,400
relationship in low density cities

82
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,319
energy consumption in the residential

83
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,200
buildings is far higher per capita than

84
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,200
in high density cities on the left of

85
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,120
the chart again between Boston and

86
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,480
Houston in Boston typical resident

87
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,159
consumes about 2 megawatt hours per year

88
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,560
in Houston about

89
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,360
4.7 this difference again is

90
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,840
attributable to City design largely

91
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,280
because in higher density multi-story

92
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,959
structure types of cities a typical home

93
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,000
will H be smaller per capita so

94
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,440
therefore less uh surface area to heat

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,440
and it will be insulated from the

96
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,120
outside perimeter of the building

97
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,840
because it's uh bounded by other units

98
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,880
in the same building in other words the

99
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:35,280
ratio between the the um the house

100
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,199
itself and the outside facade or

101
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,320
perimeter of the building um is higher

102
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,840
um and therefore in in multi-story

103
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,600
buildings in cities like Boston like New

104
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,759
York like European cities like Asian

105
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,160
cities in cities where we build up

106
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,479
rather than uh flat in single single

107
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,240
family houses or uh one-story structures

108
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,520
tend to be also more efficient uh in

109
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,560
terms of energy use

110
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,880
now I want to pull these two things

111
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,880
together and

112
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,400
emphasize that these factors of City

113
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,039
design how a city is laid out specially

114
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,160
in terms of its Urban form how its

115
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,160
infrastructure is specially configured

116
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,600
with public transit structures or public

117
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,639
transit systems with walking and biking

118
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,120
routes or Automotive infrastructure

119
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,880
determine largely where and how things

120
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,199
locate in terms of land use patterns and

121
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,880
this combination of land patterns

122
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,880
infrastructure and urban form determine

123
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,199
to a large degree how people choose to

124
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,039
travel in cities their travel behavior

125
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,360
and their activity location choices

126
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,520
where they choose to live where they

127
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,880
choose to work and how the land use

128
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,560
patterns interact with each other

129
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,160
together these influences determine some

130
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,000
of the most critical outcomes of

131
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,080
interest in um societies today things

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,280
like public health Mobility mure or CO2

133
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,160
emissions our ability to tackle climate

134
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,039
change social Equity even so we don't

135
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,960
hear very often in the conversation

136
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,720
about climate change in the

137
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,720
media that the role of Urban Design and

138
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,120
City Planning is so Central to the

139
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,479
question of tackling climate change we

140
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,560
hear about how more efficient vehicles

141
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,560
or electrification of certain services

142
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,360
or buying electric household appliances

143
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,160
can contribute to lower emissions but

144
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,319
often times those kinds of technological

145
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,360
fixes only give us incre mental

146
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,319
improvements if we want to tackle

147
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,680
climate change at the scale that's truly

148
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:41,720
necessary we have to rethink City design

149
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,120
we have to plan and design cities that

150
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,440
fundamentally consume less energy and

151
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,199
produce less emissions like the examples

152
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,919
I tried to draw out so with this in mind

153
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,319
I'm going to give a quick example of

154
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,720
three projects uh that tackle this

155
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,160
question from different angles in our

156
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,520
research group the city form Lab at MIT

157
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,879
I will first talk about how we study the

158
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,360
most green type of Mobility that there

159
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:07,639
is in cities which is pedestrian

160
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,720
mobility and how we develop research to

161
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,560
understand pedestrian preferences when

162
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,520
it comes to moving on foot in cities two

163
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,440
I will exam examine a model we have

164
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,960
built called the NYC walks model using

165
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,319
the urban network analysis framework

166
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,160
that Graham referred

167
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,039
to and three I will illustrate how such

168
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,479
a model can be used to influence

169
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,360
decision making in an evidence-based

170
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:32,520
datadriven way so so let's start with

171
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,560
pedestrian behavior and preferences

172
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,199
which is fundamental to un we need to

173
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,479
understand this so that we can model

174
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,599
pedestrians and also other green

175
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:44,680
Mobility modes like public transit users

176
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,199
and cyclists in cities uh that are true

177
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,360
to how people truly

178
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,680
behave when you walk in a city you are

179
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,360
often times faced with many

180
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,319
options whether to walk whether to take

181
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,520
public transit whether to drive one of

182
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,039
those choices is is even if you've

183
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,840
decided to take a walk in a city is

184
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:09,000
which route to choose as an example here

185
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,520
I've put up a map of New York City and

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,240
if you started a walk on Fifth Avenue

187
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,479
near near the Patrick St Patrick's

188
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,159
Cathedral uh and only walked a couple of

189
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,800
blocks over to Carnegie Hall you

190
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:24,280
actually have 84 different routes you

191
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,840
can take that are exactly the same

192
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,520
length so you have to make a

193
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,240
choice those choices that people make on

194
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,479
on their feet can help reveal

195
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,440
statistically what kinds of routes they

196
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,240
prefer what kinds of Street

197
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,640
characteristics they shy away from and

198
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,240
towards which do they gra

199
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,640
gravitate these choices are influenced

200
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,160
by the properties of the routes whether

201
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,279
they have sidewalks and how wide the

202
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,200
sidewalks are whether you have to walk

203
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,320
next to high highs speeed traffic or

204
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,839
large volumes of vehicles and a lot of

205
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,200
noise whether the route is complicated

206
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,920
whether you have to make turns along the

207
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,279
way whether you have trees or businesses

208
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,279
and amenities along the way each of

209
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,000
these properties of the different route

210
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,279
options that exist influence our choice

211
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,480
of taking uh um a particular or choosing

212
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,800
a particular route in the city to

213
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,600
understand how these choices work we

214
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:22,160
often collect data from people's cell

215
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,760
phones I'm going to show first an

216
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,560
example of studies we have conducted in

217
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,040
San Francisco and in Boston using

218
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,920
anonymized traces from cell phone

219
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,399
movements where we don't know who the

220
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,720
individuals exactly are we have an

221
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,040
agreement with an app provider who

222
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,360
shares this data but doesn't reveal the

223
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,800
Identity or the personal characteristics

224
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:49,360
of the users here's an example of about

225
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,480
15,000 people's routes in San Francisco

226
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,800
how they walked from A to B throughout

227
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,320
the street network of the

228
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:00,240
city once we have such data the original

229
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,519
GPS Trace that we get is is pretty messy

230
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,279
it's a wiggling line uh that has a lot

231
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,200
of noise so the first step in these

232
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,200
studies is to what is called map match

233
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,240
the traces to the street Network we

234
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,040
basically map what street segments were

235
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,920
used which is represented by this

236
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,880
thicker U red line and once we have that

237
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,959
we

238
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,839
can um

239
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:24,440
construct Alternatives that this person

240
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,000
could have walked for this particular

241
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,959
trip but did not this is called uh route

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,160
alternative generation

243
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:33,160
uh and the red line represents the

244
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,920
trajectory the person actually took but

245
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,880
they could have very well with roughly

246
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,079
similar distance walked alternative

247
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,920
routes we oftentimes construct half a

248
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:43,120
dozen even a dozen different alternative

249
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,720
routes and for all these routes

250
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,120
including the actual route and the

251
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,480
Alternatives we measure the properties

252
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,560
of the streets like the ones I showed on

253
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,320
the street view image before and this

254
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,120
helps us statistically model what is it

255
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,920
about that rout the routes that people

256
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,639
actually choose that systemically biases

257
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,040
people what kinds of Route

258
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,600
characteristics and properties are

259
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:08,200
people preferring when they choose their

260
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,480
routes here are some of the

261
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,480
results from Boston and San Francisco

262
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,880
and we've translated the results to

263
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,839
distance equivalent units so that means

264
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,399
for instance when we look at elevation

265
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,839
gain on the second row in San Francisco

266
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,480
each foot of elevation gain or each

267
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,240
meter of elevation gain that people have

268
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,720
to walk uphill is perceived roughly as

269
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,120
equivalent to the walk feeling like 3.8

270
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,240
M longer therefore it reduces or

271
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,440
diminishes our willingness to

272
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,040
walk however if we pass by amenities

273
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,079
like ground floor businesses on city

274
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,639
streets that is a quality that people

275
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:51,120
generally gravitate towards so passing

276
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,680
10 extra amenities on the sidewalks is

277
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,360
felt by a typical or average pedestrian

278
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,959
as if the walk feels 18 M shorter

279
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,680
therefore it increases the willingness

280
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,440
to walk walk by 18 M sidewalk widths are

281
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,000
also something people

282
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,560
prefer uh people generally also prefer

283
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,600
to walk on Greener streets that have

284
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,120
more

285
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,880
vegetation uh and they shy away from

286
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,440
traffic volumes and traffic speeds where

287
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,199
they have to interact with more cars

288
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,320
these kinds of data these kinds of

289
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:23,120
results give us an understanding of kind

290
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,240
of a revealed preference understanding

291
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,720
of what do people really prefer uh when

292
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,720
it comes to rout choice where do they

293
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,360
prefer to walk in the city and that

294
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,079
those kinds of results can be translated

295
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,000
back into the predictive models I will

296
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:38,079
be talking about next in terms of

297
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,480
forecasting where people will

298
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,720
walk these kinds of results can also

299
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,720
help us determine uh various kinds of

300
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,720
catchment studies and accessibility

301
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,800
studies in cities uh in this project

302
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,399
called boston. Transit access.com we

303
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,199
measured the 10minute catchments of

304
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:56,839
different rail Transit Stations of the

305
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:59,279
commuter rail network in the Boston

306
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,600
region and overlaid the different

307
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,560
definitions of

308
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,720
accessibility uh often times Transit

309
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,120
planners use a circle of a half mile for

310
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,160
walking access uh here we use different

311
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,560
kinds of interpretations of access the

312
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,519
red polygon shows the what we call the

313
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,079
network catchment which is precisely the

314
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,639
how far you can get in 10 minutes on the

315
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:21,240
street network but if we take into

316
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,920
account the actual properties of the

317
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,800
streets and people's reaction to these

318
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,680
properties that I showed in the previous

319
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,040
slides from these pedestrian rout Choice

320
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,279
studies we can also delineate what is

321
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:36,199
called the 10-minute perceived walk set

322
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,120
this is not how far objectively streets

323
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:41,000
can take you in 10 minutes but rather

324
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,639
how far people would be feeling like a

325
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,600
10-minute walk is from the station

326
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,360
towards the outling destinations and as

327
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,120
you can see this orange polygon showing

328
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,279
the perceived 10-minute walkshed tends

329
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,560
to be far smaller than the network

330
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:56,839
walkshed in other words negative Street

331
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,440
Properties and attributes can diminish

332
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,360
our perception of how far we can get in

333
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,839
10

334
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,680
minutes this has implications on Transit

335
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:07,519
oriented development and lots of

336
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,600
planning applications and as recently um

337
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,720
as this fall we've done a large um opin

338
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,839
study called Boston walks where we

339
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,199
recruited uh around a thousand

340
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,759
participants um who opted into being uh

341
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:23,639
tracked for a couple of weeks each and

342
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,600
here we're seeking to not only describe

343
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,399
the mobility preferences of average

344
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,959
users like we had in the San Francisco

345
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:32,079
Boston study but rather we know exactly

346
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:34,360
the demographic profiles of each users

347
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,360
who have willingly or voluntarily

348
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,399
participated therefore we can also start

349
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,519
to distinguishing how uh men and women's

350
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,480
preferences May differ young and old

351
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,079
people owning cars not owning cars and

352
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,199
we can dig into the heterogeneity of

353
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,720
these uh green Mobility preferences uh

354
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,079
by different groups of

355
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,560
people second I would like to briefly

356
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:57,880
share how we can operationalize these

357
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,399
findings in predictive models and

358
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,720
forecast and or estimate how pedestrians

359
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,600
move uh in in relatively large areas of

360
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,680
cities and even predict how planning

361
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,759
interventions can change that this is a

362
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,320
project called NYC walks which we've

363
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,880
been conducting in collaboration with

364
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,440
New York Dot and uh Department of City

365
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,160
Planning as well um and to do this

366
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,120
project we've actually built a new um

367
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,000
framework for estimating green Mobility

368
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,279
trips in cities called the urban network

369
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,759
analysis framework which is available as

370
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,079
a free and open- Source python package

371
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:33,720
called Medina or as a plug-in for design

372
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:36,440
software called

373
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,839
Rhino uh in this framework we represent

374
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,319
built environments as spatial framework

375
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,319
spatial networks this can be used in

376
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:45,519
three dimensions even within a building

377
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:47,000
as shown on the far left or at the

378
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,040
street and building level at the

379
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,319
district or neighborhood level or even

380
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,959
at the city or entire metropolitan area

381
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:58,519
level as an example how do we represent

382
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:01,319
built environments as networks well here

383
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:04,519
we have a part of Boston metropolitan

384
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:06,000
area in Somerville where Street networks

385
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,199
are represented as sidewalks and

386
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,360
crosswalks accurately representing where

387
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:12,759
people can actually move or walk as

388
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,680
pedestrians the red dots are address

389
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,160
points which are buildings where trips

390
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,240
can start or end and there's all there's

391
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,560
other types of Origins destinations for

392
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,800
Mobility as well like bus stops or Metro

393
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,720
stations and in fact the list can be

394
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,680
quite a bit

395
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,519
longer so how do we use this

396
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,000
representation to model ped mobility in

397
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,920
New York we constructed a Citywide

398
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,480
network of uh sidewalks crosswalks at

399
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,240
foot paths that cover all five borrows

400
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,399
it's probably the largest pedestrian

401
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,399
Network in the United

402
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,199
States when we model trips using Medina

403
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,120
we model trips from particular Origins

404
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,519
to particular destinations and then try

405
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,360
to estimate with software how those

406
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,160
trips for that type of trip blow over

407
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,560
the network in this case I'm

408
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,680
illustrating uh trips from one census

409
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,799
block which is shown um on the left on

410
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,360
the right here um we actually don't

411
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:09,559
represent the census block as a single

412
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,880
dot in the middle of the city block but

413
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:13,480
we subdivide it into four frontages so

414
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,360
that it represents the doors or

415
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,760
entryways on each Street surrounding

416
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,000
that block and one subway stop

417
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,439
represented by these red dots so from

418
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,720
this census block uh trips go to the

419
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,120
subway stops on foot but we do not

420
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,200
assume that they take the shortest path

421
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,679
we enable pedestrians in the model to

422
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,360
take various uh paths that are up to a

423
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,679
certain percent longer than shortest

424
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,400
path and they choose between different

425
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,880
Subway entrances so not everybody walks

426
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,600
to the closest entrance but there's a

427
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,520
destination Choice model in there which

428
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,320
is which is determined by accessibility

429
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,840
of different destinations this is uh

430
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,120
specified in just a few lines of code in

431
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,720
the Medina

432
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,760
package we can then expand it to not

433
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,280
just the N subway stop but all available

434
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,799
subway stop that this particular sensus

435
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,840
block has has around it within about a

436
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,039
10-minute walkshed or a half a mile

437
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,480
walking distance and now the trips are

438
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:11,679
split not just to the closest station

439
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,120
but trips are um making probability

440
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,720
decisions of which subway stop to uh

441
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,280
walk to depending on their accessibility

442
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,880
uh given where people want to go and if

443
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,760
we expand this further we can do this at

444
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:28,000
the city scale from all sensus blocks to

445
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,760
all transit stops or entrances

446
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,480
throughout New York City uh and it gives

447
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,120
us a detailed estimation of for that

448
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,559
kind of trip uh how many pedestrians

449
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,000
would be Crossing each uh Network

450
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,640
segment uh sidewalk or crosswalk in the

451
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,960
city and then we proceed to do this for

452
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,760
all types of trips that we uh know are

453
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,000
typically occurring during this period

454
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,840
of the day uh in the morning Peak period

455
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,640
for instance trips going from homes to

456
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,120
Metro stations home to bus stops homes

457
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,400
to jobs homes to parking garages homes

458
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,960
to schools and so forth and the pattern

459
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,240
can look different during the Lunch

460
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,280
Period or evening period this is all

461
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,280
automated with a Medina where we input

462
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:12,960
these these

463
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:15,240
um uh guidelines or uh pairings uh with

464
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,919
a CSV table to the software and at the

465
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,400
end we get the distribution for

466
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:20,120
different kinds of trips over the

467
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,799
network here are amenity to amenity

468
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,799
trips on foot estimated here are homes

469
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,720
to amenities these are businesses like

470
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,760
retailers or food service providers on

471
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,320
cities streets here's home to jobs walks

472
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,320
here's homes to Metro stations that I

473
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,080
showed earlier here's homes to Parks

474
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,520
walks here's homes to schools uh jobs to

475
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,200
amenities jobs to Metro stations parks

476
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,200
to Metro these constitute different

477
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,200
kinds of pedestrian Journeys that take

478
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,320
place during different time periods in

479
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,400
the city now those still constitute just

480
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,200
estimates so we have to calibrate this

481
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,760
model Visa V actual observed traffic

482
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,600
counts particularly pedestrian traffic

483
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,799
counts on on city streets we have over a

484
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,039
thousand locations where New York do has

485
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:08,240
collected pedestrian traffic counts and

486
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:10,679
we use these observed counts to

487
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,480
calibrate our model estimates to fit

488
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,360
them to reflect them in accurate ways

489
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,240
and this is done for different time

490
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,640
periods as a result of this we

491
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,200
statistically fit the estimation model

492
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,320
to The observed traffic counts and we

493
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,720
obtain what is called predicted flows of

494
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,679
people which relatively accurate reflect

495
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,919
pedestrian flows on the network of city

496
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,200
streets at different time periods this

497
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,720
is the evening Peak period 5: to 6:00

498
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,200
p.m. in New York City illustrating the

499
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,080
volume of pedestrians on each sidewalk

500
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,440
in the city or each crosswalk in the

501
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,520
city we can zoom into particular streets

502
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,640
or intersections here and on this zoom

503
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,440
in map the um the white labels the white

504
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,240
numbers reflect uh the model estimates

505
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,240
and the blue labels reflect our uh

506
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,840
actual Counts from do

507
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,039
so as you can see the model estimates

508
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,640
and Dot counts are not perfectly aligned

509
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,440
but they're close they're in the same

510
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,159
ballpark for instance here the street

511
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,720
segment um actually has 1,700

512
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,120
pedestrians in evening peak hour our

513
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,360
model estimates close to, 1500 so it's

514
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,600
not perfectly aligned but it's close

515
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,559
over all of these time periods the model

516
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,279
um correlation between predicted and

517
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,400
actual pedestrians at the Thousand

518
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:29,200
locations where accounts were collected

519
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,120
is around 90% so it does a pretty good

520
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,919
job at explaining actual foot traffic

521
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,400
volumes on the streets of New York now

522
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,279
why is this useful what do we do with

523
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,679
this I would like to argue for four

524
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,720
critical

525
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:46,000
needs first of

526
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,400
all these observed pedestrian counts are

527
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,440
typically available only at a handful of

528
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,720
locations in the city in New York we had

529
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,679
about thousand locations counted but New

530
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,919
York has over

531
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:02,679
315,000 Street segments so less than 1 %

532
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:05,080
less than even uh

533
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:07,840
33% of streets actually have observed

534
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,080
counts the kind of model I'm showing can

535
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,640
extrapolate the counts and explain food

536
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,679
traffic on all streets of the city and

537
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,559
this can be critical to understanding

538
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,360
how cities can allocate scarse taxpayer

539
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:24,520
dollars to improve walkability improve

540
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,279
pedestrian conditions on city streets in

541
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,440
an evidence-based way to in other words

542
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,799
prioritize streets where it benefits

543
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,520
more

544
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,080
people

545
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,480
second The Pedestrian um volume

546
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,640
estimates from the model can also

547
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,120
provide an important denominator for

548
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,320
various Hazard data like traffic crash

549
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,240
analysis like Urban heat exposure like

550
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,880
noise exposure or air pollution that

551
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,960
people are exposed to I'll show an

552
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,480
example of that in a second and last the

553
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,640
model can be used to forecast how fixes

554
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,919
or changes to the infrastructure or even

555
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,360
changes in land use such as building a

556
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,880
new Dev velopment at a particular

557
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,080
location a new office building a new

558
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,000
residential complex can impact

559
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,240
pedestrian Mobility can change how many

560
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
trips are generated and can change where

561
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,360
the trips are distributed in the network

562
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,640
of city

563
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,919
streets as an example to this

564
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:20,679
denominator idea here is an example or

565
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:23,919
here is the plot of data about the 100

566
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,360
most in um the 100 most dangerous

567
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,120
intersections for pedestrians in New

568
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,279
York City the numbers here illustrate

569
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,240
pedestrians that were injured in vehicle

570
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,880
to pedestrian crashes in a 10-year

571
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,640
period in New York City and as you can

572
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,480
see the one of the hot spots Citywide is

573
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,880
Midtown Manhattan where a lot of

574
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,880
pedestrian crashes

575
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,720
occurred um if we don't normalize this

576
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,880
data then it would look like this is a a

577
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,840
highly dangerous area of the city but if

578
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,520
you know New York City you probably also

579
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,200
familiar that this is also where the

580
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,640
some of the highest pedestrian volumes

581
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,840
actually are located places like Time

582
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,400
Square like other Midtown streets so if

583
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,200
we take the results from our pedestrian

584
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,240
flow model that I showed and divide

585
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,360
these crash data through by the the

586
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,440
estimated volumes of pedestrians we get

587
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,240
a very different picture the picture on

588
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,679
the right illustrates the probabilities

589
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,640
of pedestrian injuries or pedestrian

590
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,840
crashes which is normalized data taking

591
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,799
raw crashes and dividing them through by

592
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,720
model estimates and what we see is that

593
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:28,480
Midtown Manhattan actually disappears

594
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,080
from the picture altogether because yes

595
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,080
there are a lot of crashes in Midtown

596
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,840
Manhattan but there's also astronomical

597
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,200
numbers of pedestrians walking on those

598
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,880
streets so in terms of your probability

599
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,000
of getting into a car crash uh situation

600
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,559
is much worse in other parts of the city

601
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,640
like in Brooklyn Queens Bronx and even

602
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,840
Staten

603
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,679
Island and let me finish up by a third

604
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,080
um illustration which is taking these

605
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,399
kinds of models into a predictive realm

606
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,640
and using them to help a city guide

607
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:00,399
decision making where infrastru Str

608
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,919
improvements should be positioned so

609
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:05,600
that they will benefit most constituents

610
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:09,399
this is a work we're doing um currently

611
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,279
in Seattle to help the city uh achieve a

612
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:13,760
data driven approach for sidewalk

613
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:17,039
improvements particularly the attention

614
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,279
paid here is to um universal access on

615
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,399
Wheelchairs and people with walking aids

616
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:25,640
not only uh fully abled um pedestrians

617
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:28,840
as well so we have three groups of users

618
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,799
PR apathetic users who are uh able boded

619
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,279
we have Mobility aided users who are

620
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,360
typically either young or old and need

621
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:39,000
walking aids and wheelchair users we put

622
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,480
together a network of accurate sidewalk

623
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,520
conditions um uh in the city center of

624
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,640
Seattle um and loaded that network with

625
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,480
detailed properties of what each segment

626
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,399
is like how wide are the sidewalks does

627
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,240
it contain stairs or steps uh is there a

628
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:54,520
marked Crossing on a street corner or

629
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,279
not would you have to walk through

630
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,360
traffic or is there a safe Crossing and

631
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:03,159
so forth and additionally we combine the

632
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:06,880
network with uh Ada or Americans with

633
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,399
disability access uh data so these data

634
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,320
come from a study done at the University

635
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:14,279
of Washington project sidewalk where

636
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,960
users mapped in detail where obstacles

637
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,320
exist on the sidewalk Network for

638
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,039
particularly wheelchair users where you

639
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,760
have broken sidewalks where you have

640
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:25,640
steps no curb ramps and so

641
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,640
forth having constructed this network we

642
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,520
have a series of assumptions of how

643
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,960
sensitive different people are to the

644
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,200
different conditions uh as an example

645
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,120
for instance uh if a sidewalk is

646
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,600
narrower than 36 in then it may be

647
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,960
somewhat of an inconvenience um for

648
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,919
perioptic or able-bodied users but it

649
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,440
can be prohibitive for people with

650
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:50,880
walking aids or wheelchairs who simply

651
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,880
cannot fit through that um

652
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:56,720
width so to understand how the network

653
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,360
of a city impacts uh pedestrian

654
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,679
accessibility for these types of of

655
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,360
users we conduct or we collect a basket

656
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,080
of daily destinations that people

657
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,200
typically need access to things like

658
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:12,039
schools Transit stations businesses

659
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,880
parks and so forth and we construct a an

660
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:16,960
accessibility index something like a

661
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:19,039
walk score that measures how easily

662
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,200
users of different kinds can access this

663
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,520
standard basket of daily destinations

664
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,919
from each address point in the city if

665
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,520
you're a paripe able-bodied user your

666
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,080
access tends to be wider you get to more

667
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,640
places if you are using a walking Aid

668
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,919
you're typically more sensitive to

669
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,799
Street conditions and some conditions

670
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,080
prohibit your access all together so

671
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,559
your walk sheds tend to be smaller and

672
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,960
with wheelchairs they tend to be smaller

673
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:48,039
yet as illustrated by this black Network

674
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,960
we can measure combined accessibility to

675
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:52,159
all this basket of destination Citywide

676
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,640
from every address point and as you can

677
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,440
see on these three Maps uh on the right

678
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,120
hand side for wheelchair users the

679
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,679
values look more purple or blue that

680
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,240
signals that their accessibility levels

681
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:08,240
are systemically lower than on the map

682
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:10,320
on the left for able-bodied users uh

683
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,080
largely because the infrastructure has

684
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,200
issues has obstacles and also because

685
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,640
this type of user is more sensitive to

686
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,000
infrastructure conditions we can plot

687
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,039
this as a cumulative distribution and

688
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,480
illustrate Citywide how accessibility

689
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:28,360
levels differ amongst the three user

690
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:32,559
groups and most importantly

691
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:35,480
we can use this framework to analyze how

692
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,279
fixing sidewalk conditions that we know

693
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,200
exist like missing curb ramps like

694
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,200
missing uh zebra Crossings like even

695
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,440
missing sidewalks Alto together can

696
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,880
improve accessibility for any of these

697
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,919
three user groups certain things are not

698
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,600
fixable for instance elevation gain the

699
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:53,640
Topography of the city it would be

700
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,519
extremely hard to change that because it

701
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,799
would level it would mean leveling hills

702
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,679
and mountains in in Seattle but other

703
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:03,039
things are much easier and so we we have

704
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:04,640
this concept called The fixability Gap

705
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,320
uh which illustrates that in this

706
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,720
example if you fixed all the

707
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,799
infrastructure problems that are

708
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,679
actually fixable how much would you

709
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:14,880
improve accessibility across all user

710
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,799
groups in the city but perhaps more

711
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,720
importantly on a daily basis we

712
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,840
shouldn't be talking about fixing all

713
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,679
infrastructure problems in one go but

714
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,960
rather individual fixes at individual

715
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,960
locations so what we're doing now is

716
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:31,279
developing a data driven prioritization

717
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,600
system that allows the city to uh rank

718
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,080
order the different fixes and say we

719
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,840
should really fix this curb ramp this

720
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,279
sidewalk or this street first because it

721
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,120
has the greatest public benefit it opens

722
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,960
up access to the largest number of

723
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,799
people especially the more vulnerable uh

724
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:52,000
Road users so that's what we're working

725
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:54,039
on and the idea is to then uh guide the

726
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,440
uh repairs construction of these curb

727
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:58,720
Rams uh and taxpayer investments into

728
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,760
city streets into places where they make

729
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,120
the greatest impact with that um I will

730
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,080
wrap up um and just um emphasize that

731
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,240
for cities to move towards green

732
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,279
Mobility targets we actually have to

733
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,080
count data on that we have to model on

734
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:17,880
that not only cars uh which cities have

735
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,120
been doing for decades we need models to

736
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,840
represent those environments from a user

737
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:25,440
perspective which these kinds of tools

738
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,960
have tried to share um help us do and uh

739
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,919
the framework we built in this Urban

740
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,559
network analysis

741
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:35,240
um world helps us uh uh do these

742
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,840
analysis in an open- source reproducible

743
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,080
and free ways that are also available to

744
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,240
anyone who's interested um in in working

745
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,080
these areas thank you thank you very

746
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:49,360
much Andre for this very insightful

747
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,600
presentation on the urban Network and

748
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,159
knowledgeis frame framework I wonder if

749
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,600
you can um for as far as questions are

750
00:30:55,159 --> 00:31:00,039
concerned how you think uh like three

751
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:04,279
type of

752
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:07,960
uh users city

753
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:11,000
planners and smes and the

754
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:14,080
pedestrians uh how they can leverage the

755
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,080
model you've

756
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,880
developed yeah uh for city planners I

757
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:24,279
think these sorts of models um really

758
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:27,320
give us and other city planners a means

759
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:28,799
to represent Urban environments pretty

760
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,120
close to how people on the ground

761
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,000
perceive them um with the kind of detail

762
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,240
and resolution that reflects what a

763
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,039
pedestrian really must go through on a

764
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,679
city street uh whether they're walking

765
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,480
on a comfortable segment whether they're

766
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,960
passing other businesses or people

767
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,039
whether they are um uh how direct their

768
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:50,880
trips are and so forth so I think for

769
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:53,360
city planners it opens up a whole world

770
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,559
of representing uh cities Through The

771
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,559
Eyes of the user and therefore allows us

772
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,639
to do analysis

773
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,200
that reflect how changes in land uses

774
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:06,279
and changes in infrastructure would

775
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,240
impact the non-motorized users on city

776
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:10,080
streets so if we develop a new

777
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,760
development at this location it will add

778
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,519
new trip origins or trip discriminations

779
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:17,480
it will change the foot traffic dynamics

780
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,240
of an area or if we fix a street here

781
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,360
how many people will it benefit and how

782
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,799
will it affect the flow of pedestrians

783
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,679
through that area um and ultimately

784
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:28,840
increase desirably the amount of people

785
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:33,000
who can comfortably safely walk in the

786
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:35,440
city for end users it opens up um a kind

787
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,279
of a bottomup way of uh representing

788
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,120
their own interests they people can run

789
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:42,600
their own models they can represent

790
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,840
their own questions through these models

791
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,360
and Advocate with data to represent

792
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,320
their interests if they go to City Hall

793
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,279
meetings or advocate for um their

794
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:55,679
neighborhood or neighbor benefits they

795
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:59,320
can uh uh develop analysis scenarios and

796
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,000
say if we put a uh safer Street here or

797
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,880
complete Street here this is how it

798
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,200
would benefit our community um and when

799
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,120
for City governments I think um we we

800
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,120
are witnessing an important shift

801
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,000
towards these kinds of analytic tools

802
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,200
that allow cities to uh not only say

803
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,960
that we want to move towards Greener and

804
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,120
more sustainable Mobility but to

805
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,559
actually be able to model these

806
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,840
Transitions and to quantify whether the

807
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,600
decisions that are being taken on a

808
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,440
daily basis in infrastructure investment

809
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,480
or permitting for new developments move

810
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,159
us in the right direction or actually

811
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,159
away from that

812
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:37,320
direction thank you uh another question

813
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,320
here from the audience is that uh how

814
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,880
your model

815
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:48,200
can um take into consider consideration

816
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,200
of the like a live data real- time live

817
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:55,000
data

818
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:57,799
um these models are currently uh they

819
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,720
currently represent um built environment

820
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:06,760
I conditions and foot traffic at typical

821
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:10,639
Peak periods if we calibrated a model to

822
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:13,760
specifically uh estimate flows for kind

823
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,480
of live environments let's say uh not

824
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,599
not a typical Peak period at uh Time

825
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,280
Square New York uh in the morning or

826
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:24,399
evening but rather a specific time slot

827
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,040
like 10:45 a.m. uh then the model would

828
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:29,200
have to be trained uh also on live

829
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,919
calibration so it could be rather than

830
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,359
being trained on this kind of static

831
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:34,879
data we have it could be trained on

832
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:37,079
Dynamic data and uh provide the

833
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:39,839
estimates in real time how food traffic

834
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:41,560
conditions change um in the city it's a

835
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,560
little bit like weather forecasting

836
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,560
where if you want to do live weather

837
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,079
forecasting uh you have to uh input data

838
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,280
from all the sensors that are currently

839
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,879
reading it uh as we

840
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,919
speak great that's sounds like a a

841
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,720
typical L application large language

842
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:01,280
model application

843
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:05,920
uh one last question before we move on

844
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:09,720
um also related to data uh for for your

845
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,200
model if there there isn't enough like

846
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:15,440
data basically that basically for cities

847
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:18,359
that does not that that that those

848
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,760
cities still not data reach how do you

849
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:23,880
think you can um address that

850
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,200
challenge yeah this is a great question

851
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,720
in fact we have uh quite actively in our

852
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,240
research group tried to work in uh

853
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,200
places around the global South where

854
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,000
data is much harder to get than than say

855
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:39,440
here in Boston or or New York City um

856
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,920
there is an emerging body of open-source

857
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,400
data repositories for places around the

858
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,599
world and in my experience it is totally

859
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,640
possible to put together the necessary

860
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,000
data for these sorts of models from

861
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,319
existing open source repositories for

862
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,160
most of the world uh building footprint

863
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:57,640
data is now globally available for any

864
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,960
place in the world from satellite IM

865
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,400
imagery Road network data often times

866
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,800
comes from open street map or if

867
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,520
necessary can be digitized by research

868
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,720
teams or city staff on the ground which

869
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,800
we have done in other cases origin

870
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,760
destination data about land uses or

871
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,240
business locations sometimes can be

872
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,880
obtained from uh looking through either

873
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:23,440
open street map or even Google Maps uh

874
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,000
API and and other sources of mapping um

875
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,119
and we have open source street view

876
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,359
imagery in many parts of the world uh

877
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,680
websites like miller.com that show open

878
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:35,319
source street view that is not propriety

879
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,200
proprietary like Google street view or

880
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:40,960
uh Bing Street View and so forth so

881
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,599
there's a emerging body of sources uh

882
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,280
which require slightly more work to put

883
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,839
the data sets together but it's possible

884
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,839
and um uh especially if these are

885
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:54,720
critical areas um in emerging cities um

886
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,040
uh it may be well worth the effort to

887
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,880
generate these data because ultimately

888
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,440
as young Gail likes to emphasize we must

889
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,680
count what we care for if we just

890
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,920
represent car traffic in models uh then

891
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,640
decisions will be made for car traffic

892
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,560
if we want to represent pedestrians and

893
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,160
other sustainable Mobility users we must

894
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,480
represent these environments accordingly

895
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,200
to to illustrate their

896
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:23,240
perspectives yes I totally agree I think

897
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,680
The Pedestrian aspect or if you call it

898
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:29,480
human Centric uh perspectives is very

899
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:32,800
very important in addition to like

900
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:36,440
Mobility or Transportation Focus thank

901
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,839
you very much I can see um the huge

902
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:43,280
potential of your model um in really

903
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,800
enhancing the sust sustainable Mobility

904
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,040
social interactions and liable cities

905
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:53,160
overall thank you

906
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,160
again thank you very much
