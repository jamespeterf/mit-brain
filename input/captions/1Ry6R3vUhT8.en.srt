1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,080
thank you everyone for attending the

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,359
Rene Salazar speaker series hosted by

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,759
latinx at the broad and thank you for

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,360
the broad Institute for allowing us to

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,280
do this series just a brief introduction

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,440
for the latinx community so latinx abroo

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,599
has a mission of building Community

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,439
among latinx brodies and empowering

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,800
members of latinx communities so we host

10
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:21,640
events regularly today we have also a

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,680
movie

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,119
viewing and the purpose of the speaker

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,800
series is to highlight latinxs and

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,720
diverse researchers within and outside

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
the broad Institute we want to Foster

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,520
collaboration and allow ibility and role

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,320
models for diverse individuals and we

18
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,680
also want to allow opportunities to

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,000
network and promote research from our

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,120
community please feel free to post your

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,239
questions in the Q&A and they'll be

22
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,000
answered live or you can just put it in

23
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,559
the chat and we can answer the or we can

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
ask the question as we go now I just

25
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,640
want to give you a brief

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,480
introduction of uh our speaker today so

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,480
our speaker is Dr Philipa Rio ferer and

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,280
is an assistant professor of infectious

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,559
diseases and vaccinology at Berkeley

30
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,119
Public Health with a joint appointment

31
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,360
in the molecular and cell biology

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,000
Department immunology and molecular Med

33
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,880
medicine Division and for her malaria is

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,880
a major symptom and it's a very focal

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,400
area of her research such as sleeping

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,960
sickness and she combines molecular and

37
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,640
parasytes mosquito development and

38
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,119
Immunology and Neuroscience to ask

39
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,040
questions about the role of circadian

40
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,880
rhythms in the evolution of pathogen

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,479
Genesis of parasitic infections so her

42
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,119
Focus will be on circadian rhythms and

43
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,320
providing and how they provide an

44
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,920
advantage to organisms from bacteria to

45
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,200
humans and this will deepen our

46
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,840
understanding of the daily biology of

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,240
parasites and it'll enable us to design

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,880
effective interventions so take it away

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,040
Dr Ria

50
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,680
Ferrera thank you thank you so much

51
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,799
Ricardo and it's an honor to be here and

52
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,119
celebrate with you this wonderful

53
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,119
Community I feel like also the the past

54
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,960
few weeks have been of uncertainty in

55
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:00,759
science and just kind of uplifting each

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,520
other celebrating our scientific

57
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,799
achievements and paying it forward for

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,200
the next generation is very important

59
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,759
for me so I'm very grateful to have the

60
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,080
opportunity to share with you our

61
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,640
research on circadian rhythms in

62
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,599
parasitic

63
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,200
diseases we are as Ricardo said based at

64
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,040
out Berkeley and we are mostly focusing

65
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:27,519
on malaria uh but you will hear a little

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,640
bit about sleeping sickness too

67
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:33,640
so life on Earth is sh shaped by

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,160
circadian rhythms and the earth rotation

69
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:40,400
really creates these very predictable

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,239
cycles of light and darkness that shaped

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,319
how many different organisms evolved

72
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:51,040
ways to anticipate this uh environmental

73
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:53,360
Cycles to regulate our sleep wake cycle

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,280
our metabolism our immune response this

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,159
is all controlled by our circadian

76
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,560
clock clock disruption itself is quite

77
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,200
detrimental either through genetic uh

78
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,879
disruption or

79
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,840
through um environmental uh input such

80
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,120
as chronic jet lag it leads to higher

81
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,239
incidences of cancer and metabolic

82
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,200
syndrome also half of the genes in our

83
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:22,480
body are under circadian control and 75%

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,360
of clinical trials that tested time of

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,239
day treatment showed benefits at

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,599
specific times either for example for

87
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,959
lower toxicity of drugs or higher uh

88
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,760
Effectiveness however a lot less is

89
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,799
understood about how the circadian clock

90
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,959
regulates infections in malaria it's

91
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,159
really a striking example and that's

92
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,400
because malaria's main symptom it's its

93
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,560
periodic

94
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,239
fevers we knew these to be a

95
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,840
characteristic of these infection before

96
00:03:53,239 --> 00:04:00,120
we knew it what caused by a parasite for

97
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,200
since the Asian Greece you had descript

98
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,040
of a disease that had fevers that would

99
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,959
come and go at certain times of the day

100
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,439
that now we know are really a

101
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,159
consequence of a synchronous bursting of

102
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,920
parasites out out of our red blood cells

103
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,880
so this is a phenomena that you have

104
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,280
this unicellular plasmodium parasites

105
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,600
coordinated in their Invasion their

106
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,240
replication and then the burst out of

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,320
the red blood cells that releases

108
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,000
millions of new parasites and triggers

109
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,800
our immune system to respond with the

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,080
fever in different plasmodium species

111
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:41,160
have the cycle last either 24 48 or 72

112
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,960
hours so all multiple of 24 which is

113
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,560
quite an interesting number when we

114
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,880
think about this circadian clock and so

115
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,080
for the longest time we had assumed that

116
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:56,160
Paras diseases that had this rhythmic

117
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,800
phenomena were really a consequence of

118
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,120
the host rhythms because most of these

119
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,120
parastic diseases do not have any free

120
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,360
leaving stage but what if parasites had

121
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,440
ciran clocks well this would matter

122
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,479
because it would change how we think

123
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,520
about their biology but potentially

124
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:16,880
would open possibilities for

125
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,560
interventions so how could we test that

126
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:24,039
um we can actually leverage a lot the

127
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,080
biology of the host the Maman system is

128
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:29,160
very well uh understood and amazing

129
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,080
tools have already been developed so if

130
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,479
we focus for example on the clock of the

131
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,280
Mouse as a model organism you can

132
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,360
simplify it by having two key

133
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,400
transcription factors uh activators

134
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,680
clock and Beal uh that are binding to

135
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,520
the promoter of multiple genes and

136
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,800
activate their transcription and amongst

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,919
the genes that they transcribed are

138
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,080
their own repressors this is the

139
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:58,600
families of cryptochromes in Period

140
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,039
whose proteins then translocate back

141
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,639
into the nucleus and hold the

142
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,280
transcription the clock and bile they

143
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:09,599
activate transcription of multiple other

144
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,880
sets of genes that act on different

145
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:16,639
Pathways and that's how the core is so

146
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:19,759
Central to Maman physiology but this

147
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,840
Loop is really intrinsic meaning that it

148
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,960
still

149
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:28,240
lasts 24 hours even in constant

150
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,520
conditions and that is the definition of

151
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,880
an intrinsic clock so during my post

152
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,680
talk in The Takahashi lab I was able to

153
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,840
leverage these amazing tools that exist

154
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:43,360
in the Circadian field such as for

155
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,000
example mice that lack uh two of these

156
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,800
repressors the cryptochrome one and two

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,560
and these animals now once without

158
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,160
environmental cues in constant Darkness

159
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,599
they lose all their rhythmicity so their

160
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,160
sleep awake Cycles become disrupted

161
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:01,560
their gene expression and so on and so

162
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,840
we were able to take advantage of these

163
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,840
Mouse model and infect them with

164
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,680
plasmodium parasites we put them in the

165
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,840
in constant Darkness we waited for five

166
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,479
days after we infected them and then we

167
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,039
started collecting blood samples every

168
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,919
four hours to assess uh by RNA

169
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,960
sequencing the parasite transcripton and

170
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,639
that was to really ask the question what

171
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,560
was going on on the parasite rhythms

172
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:32,000
were the parasite rhythms uh going to be

173
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,560
as rhythmic as they usually are in Wild

174
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,360
type hosts or now in these arhythmic

175
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,919
mutant m Are The rhythms going to be

176
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:45,159
disrupted and so once we analyzed the

177
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:49,319
RNA sequencing of the parasite we

178
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:51,879
realized that as expected in Wild type

179
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,800
animals even in constant Darkness the

180
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,479
parasite biology was highly rhythmic and

181
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,680
you can see here uh in this heat map uh

182
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,680
4,000 genes that are being rhythmically

183
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:09,039
expressed across the day so expressed

184
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,840
picking once a day and these are uh 80%

185
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:15,039
of the whole transcriptome of malaria

186
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,120
parasites but interest interestingly

187
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,080
even in these a rythmic hosts there were

188
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,039
still about 3,000 genes that were

189
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,960
showing these rhythmic expression

190
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,479
patterns really letting us to conclude

191
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,440
that the parasites rhythms are intrinsic

192
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,800
to the parasite and not simply a

193
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,080
consequence of the host

194
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:40,120
clock this refrains how we think about

195
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:44,200
this infection malaria is transmitted by

196
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,519
a mosquito so this is a three organism

197
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,320
interaction the host the parasite and

198
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:53,240
the mosquito and each of them have an

199
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,560
intrinsic clock and how we um are now

200
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,399
trying to understand a lot more in

201
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,959
detail how they communicate with one

202
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:03,760
another but on that original uh

203
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:07,440
um um discovery about their intrinsic

204
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,920
rhythms we also start testing if these

205
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,640
you know reduction from 80% of the

206
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,160
transcriptome cycling to 60% if that

207
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,320
reduction was exactly as we would

208
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:22,760
predict from a a non circadian system

209
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,120
and so what we know from other model

210
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,640
organisms of the Circadian uh clock is

211
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,320
that at the populational level if we

212
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,600
were are for example considering a group

213
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:38,399
of cells all these cells are showing as

214
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,120
an average a daily Rhythm once they are

215
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,040
exposed to these environmental cues

216
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,519
happening in a predictive and rhythmic

217
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,880
pattern however once in constant

218
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,000
conditions because it's an intrinsic

219
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:55,279
property the Rhythm still persists but

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,680
as you can see the amplitude of the

221
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,640
oscillation is increased and that is

222
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,120
because there is a slow

223
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,160
desynchronization amongst the cells that

224
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,440
are um encompassing this

225
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,279
population and here you have that

226
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,320
representation uh experimentally so here

227
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,240
this is an amazing tool one of the

228
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,200
pioneer uh

229
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,360
circadian uh tools that are that have

230
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,839
luciferase let me play it again that

231
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,320
have luciferase fused uh to uh the P one

232
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,000
of the the repressors period proteins or

233
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,279
under his promoe

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,880
and you can see once a day Lucifer is um

235
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:39,360
so light being uh expressed in these

236
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,079
cells and this is a a slice from a

237
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,959
tissue from the hypothalamus the

238
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:46,920
supermatic nucleus but if you now

239
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:49,040
dissociate the neurons of these 20,000

240
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,800
urans you dissociate them and you put

241
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,200
them in culture without any any external

242
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,760
stimulus what you can notice if you were

243
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,880
to follow one particular neuron is this

244
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,880
beautiful rhythmic tray

245
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,279
but if you now look at the whole uh

246
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,639
petri dish you can see that there is

247
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:11,839
some unsynchronized Christmas light

248
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:14,839
going on right and that you can now also

249
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,560
represent multiple individual neurons

250
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,399
and if you were to to trace a line for

251
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,560
their average you would see this flat

252
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:25,000
black line so that is what is expected

253
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,120
is that each individual neuron has a

254
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,240
clock but if you don't have any

255
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,880
synchronizing cues they will not

256
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,760
um rhythmically in sync with one another

257
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,200
so we decided to take again malaria uh

258
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,800
infection of this arhythmic mutant

259
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,760
mice and follow what happens later right

260
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,639
we knew that until day seven they were

261
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,639
very bmic but what happens later are

262
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,839
they also going to be uh uh becoming out

263
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,160
of sync and so what you have in this

264
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:58,320
plot is representing one of the stages

265
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,760
morphologically that will be the ring

266
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,040
stage so the Beautiful one at the top

267
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,160
sorry my cursor didn't seem to work so

268
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,839
the first one at the top of that little

269
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:11,720
illustration and if you look at 9: a.m

270
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,440
you would see most Almost 100% of the

271
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,199
parasites all in this stage and as day

272
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,839
goes by uh that continues in Wild type

273
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:24,000
animals but in a rythmic mutant animals

274
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:27,800
that eventually stops happening and John

275
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,360
Abel from MIT modeled these with us and

276
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,680
uh compared it even to the

277
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,440
desynchronization rate that would be

278
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,199
expected from other uh circadian systems

279
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:43,800
and it seems that plasmodium is at in

280
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:46,639
par or if even even slower at

281
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,560
desynchronizing based on his modeling so

282
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,440
that you would have a decline in The

283
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,639
rhythms at the populational level

284
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,279
potentially due to a synchrony between

285
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,120
each individual parasite but what

286
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,480
exactly so that us to conclude that the

287
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,120
host still matters right for some

288
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,199
synchronization but what what would be

289
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,399
those potential cues of the host that

290
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:12,959
were helping parasites being syn with

291
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:16,399
one another and there have been two

292
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:19,360
beautiful stories uh on proposing that

293
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,920
the food and the timing of the host

294
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:27,040
feeding were the main cues and that is

295
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:30,399
because when um when they were testing

296
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,480
again the ring stage type of of plotting

297
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,760
when they were monitoring when parasites

298
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:40,480
were at that ring stage at nighttime

299
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:43,079
feeding animals or in the opposite uh

300
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,560
forc daytime feeding so swapping the

301
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:48,800
time that food would be available to

302
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:51,839
mice you would see a shift of the

303
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,120
parasite timing proposing that the

304
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,600
timing of food intake is defining when

305
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,880
parasites uh rhythms is happening so we

306
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:05,759
decided to test how important was really

307
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:08,880
the food timing for uh plasmodium

308
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,000
rhythms and for that we actually were

309
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,000
able to take advantage of a different

310
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:19,600
feeding regiment which we described it

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:23,279
as spread outfit so we would have um

312
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,360
animals uh access to food through an

313
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,440
automated fether system that was

314
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,800
actually developed uh during my postdoc

315
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,440
by Victoria Costa Rodriguez who's now at

316
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,920
the

317
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:40,000
NIH and uh what Victoria's system allows

318
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,920
is not only to monitor exactly when

319
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,639
animals are eating but program when they

320
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:49,160
can have access to food and so we can

321
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:53,079
then take advantage and have the food be

322
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,680
delivered at um a regular interval

323
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:58,000
throughout the day abolishing feeding

324
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:01,040
rhythms and so how we actually uh read

325
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,240
this out is through do Behavior essays

326
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:07,320
which we call actograms so we can

327
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,880
monitor here on the left side you have

328
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,320
the white bars represented the day light

329
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,040
window and the black bar at the top

330
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,320
represents the dark and you have the

331
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,079
multiple days of recording and in Black

332
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,320
you have the animals activity by

333
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,920
monitoring how much they go to their

334
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,480
running wheel and you can see that M are

335
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,600
nocturnal most of the activity happens

336
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,279
at nighttime and uh with her automated

337
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,480
feathers we can now also man monitor

338
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,240
when the animal is actually taking the

339
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,759
pallet for for eating which is

340
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,839
represented in red which you can see it

341
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:46,199
also coincides during the the nighttime

342
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,600
but then in the right panel you have the

343
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:51,279
now the actogram of the spread out

344
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,560
feeding regiment in which um during the

345
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,360
first few days animals are allowed to do

346
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,040
what they want so they still eat and are

347
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,279
active at nighttime but once we impose

348
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,279
the feeding regiment they still choose

349
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,199
to be active during the nighttime but

350
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,319
they have to now to take access and they

351
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:11,800
are taking now the pallet every 1 hour

352
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,920
and 42 minutes so they eat the same but

353
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:18,120
the pattern is clearly disrupted which

354
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:22,000
you can see Quantified on the most right

355
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,839
graphs so once we impose these U and

356
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,759
then we infected them with plasmodium

357
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,720
parasites we went to see what would

358
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,160
happen to parasite

359
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,720
rhythms but not much happened right if

360
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:37,120
you see on the morphological side

361
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,560
parasite rhythms were still very obvious

362
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,440
uh across um morph morphological

363
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,480
assessment but also at the gene

364
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,199
expression there were still about the

365
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,720
same number of genes cycling in both

366
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:53,600
these conditions and the overlap was

367
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,480
really massive so very little was

368
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,920
changed on upon the spread out feeding

369
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,160
meaning that the timing of food intake

370
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,560
is not a driver for The rhythms and

371
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:06,039
potentially is something else that is

372
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:09,919
being modulated by the timing of food

373
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:13,600
and not the actual U feeding itself so

374
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,679
it uh this study led us to conclude that

375
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,559
indeed plasmodium has an intrinsic loock

376
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:21,400
but the molecular mechanism and the host

377
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,760
cues that really help parasites being

378
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:28,000
sync remains

379
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:30,679
unknown and plasmodium is not the only

380
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,720
parasite that has an intrinsic clock

381
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:36,240
actually sleeping sickness uh uh which

382
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,120
is caused by tranos Bru is another

383
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,240
example of a parasite that has uh an

384
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,120
intrinsic clock and this was actually

385
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:47,840
work that I did early on during my uh

386
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:52,240
PhD and it is a much simpler system so I

387
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,559
thought it was uh worthwhile um telling

388
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,600
you a little bit about it because this

389
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,840
parasite is extracellular so we can even

390
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:05,919
culture it in the lab without any host

391
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:09,159
cells and so that made it quite uh quite

392
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:12,360
um yeah much easier to assess if it has

393
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:15,120
rhythms because we could monitor uh the

394
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,400
parasite transcriptome without any host

395
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,480
cues and what we found is that indeed

396
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,840
even without host cells even without

397
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,120
environmental CU changes in constant

398
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,039
condition there were about 10% of the

399
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,320
parasite transcrypt Tom that was rmic

400
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,440
expressed and most of these were

401
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,880
regulating the parasite metabolism as

402
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,320
you can see here in terms of Pathways

403
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,720
and that translates into two rush hours

404
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,520
of metabolic activity for these

405
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:50,360
parasites when we measure for example

406
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,480
ATP levels in in cells and we tried to

407
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,960
understand a little bit about like why

408
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,559
why uh and what could be the

409
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,600
consequences of this rhythmic biology

410
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:03,280
and because a lot of the antiparasitic

411
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,320
drugs act on metabolic pathways of

412
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,520
parasites we decided to do amongst uh

413
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,320
different challenges a challenge for

414
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,640
treatment with drugs and so surine is a

415
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,600
drug commonly used in the clinic to

416
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,360
treat these a blood stage um sleeping

417
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,840
sickness uh infection and so we decided

418
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,440
to do a dose response curve but

419
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,400
initiated at four hours apart across the

420
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,520
day and what you can see here is that um

421
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,159
there is of course killing of parasites

422
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,280
uh as you increase the drug

423
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:38,400
concentration but there are shifts in

424
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:42,320
these dose response curves um

425
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,679
translating into changes in ic50s were

426
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,880
of about two and a half fold depending

427
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,720
on when you're initiating which you can

428
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:55,080
see here represented in that um little

429
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:59,880
fi showing the the automated the

430
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:03,880
increase the full change so overall that

431
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:07,039
two different parasites have clocks and

432
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,280
that regulate their biology but why why

433
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,320
would parasites have evolved in

434
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:15,159
intrinsic clocks is still a big question

435
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,360
and we can speculate multiple advantages

436
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:21,039
for parasites perhaps it's really to

437
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,400
anticipate the nutrient waves they're

438
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,080
going to need to have uh their

439
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,840
replication for their replication

440
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,640
they're going to need to have essential

441
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:34,760
um um amino acids we are ultimately

442
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:38,280
their source for nutrients we eat at a

443
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,280
certain timing that could be important

444
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,600
as an evolutionary pressure could be

445
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:48,080
about the immune response the last few

446
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,039
years have been quite uh remarkable in

447
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,000
identifying many different immune

448
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:55,159
regulatory Pathways that are under

449
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,120
cirtin control in terms of uh cells

450
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:00,360
coming out of the bone marrow at certain

451
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,559
times of the day Migra ation and also

452
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,559
fosic activity of many different um

453
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:08,200
aspects of immune system and so that

454
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:11,400
could be an evolutionary pressure for

455
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:14,320
parasites to be rhythmic could be

456
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,120
matching the biology to the vector time

457
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,720
or of biting the two examples of

458
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,840
parasitic diseases that I mentioned

459
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,200
involve a vector that transmits the

460
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,279
disease if the parasite transmissible

461
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,360
forms were to be around at the time of

462
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:31,840
biting they would most likely be more

463
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:35,520
efficient at propagating the

464
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,559
disease many of these hypothesis uh uh

465
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,400
that we have actually different projects

466
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:43,400
in the lab uh that are Guided by them

467
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,039
but we are also able to think about that

468
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,200
beyond the fundamental aspect of being

469
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:50,039
quite interesting that perhaps the

470
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,799
existence of intrinsic clocks in

471
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:54,400
parasites could be useful for

472
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:57,080
interventions and that is the example of

473
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:01,000
the treatment time that I just mentioned

474
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,919
to you uh regarding ing um camine as a

475
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,600
proof of principle especially

476
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:07,640
considering that a lot of the

477
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:11,799
antiparasitic drugs have short half life

478
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:14,720
but we can also think about the parasite

479
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:17,960
clock as potential therapeutic Target

480
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,279
since there is going to be very little

481
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,520
overlap if any to our own clock and so

482
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:27,000
that could be another source of

483
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,760
opportunity and in our lab we are very

484
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,799
interested in understanding the

485
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,480
interactions between host parasite and

486
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:37,279
Vector but the the first question we

487
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,720
tackled uh in our lab one once we

488
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:42,679
started was really whether the parasite

489
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:46,080
clock modulated malaria transmission and

490
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:50,039
this was this is the uh the exciting for

491
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,480
me the exciting work we have now uh

492
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:55,000
finalized that I would like to share

493
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,480
with you so we've been thinking about

494
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,919
malaria transmission we cannot ignore

495
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:05,240
the mosquito cell glands so malaria uh

496
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,039
starts with a bite of these aniles

497
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:12,159
mosquitoes usually during nighttime

498
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:15,720
during that uh bite uh both parasites

499
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,240
and saliva is injected and the saliva of

500
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,679
mosquitoes has this amazing

501
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,559
pharmacological cocktail of proteins

502
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,480
that modulate our own biology it

503
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:29,480
modulates our coagulation patterns

504
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,480
platelet aggregation there's imuno

505
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,039
modulation and

506
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,120
even modulates the the mosquito host

507
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,000
sticking

508
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,679
Behavior once uh in our skin parasites

509
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,760
quickly make their way to the liver

510
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:48,360
where they would replicate and progress

511
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,360
to the blood stage where they'll be able

512
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,440
to be uptaken upon the next blood meal

513
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,640
so the salivary glands by harboring

514
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,480
parasites and also the the proteins that

515
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,320
are going to allow for these efficient

516
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:05,279
blood meal are really key drivers of

517
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:09,760
malaria transmission so we focused on

518
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:13,840
these tissue so what we've done was to

519
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,799
had mosquitoes um feed on Infected

520
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,480
animals so they become infected

521
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:21,720
themselves wait 18 days until the

522
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,240
parasites reach the salivary glands of

523
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,840
mosquitoes and then start collecting

524
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,840
samples every four hours for RNA

525
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,799
sequencing in mosquit that are house in

526
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,000
normal light and dark conditions and in

527
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:38,279
constant

528
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,600
Darkness once we sequenced the the for

529
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:43,360
RNA sequencing we were able to assess a

530
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,240
lot of the biological functions of the

531
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,039
mosquito themselves and what we found

532
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,440
was that about half of the salivary

533
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,960
gland gene expression was under

534
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,320
circadian control you can see here these

535
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:00,399
heat Maps these are about 5,000 genes

536
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,559
that are cycling expressing uh once a

537
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:06,520
day in both light and dark and constant

538
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:08,880
Darkness conditions in these

539
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:12,200
mosquitoes many of the pathways that

540
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,000
were being regulated rhythmically is for

541
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,159
example uh

542
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,159
glycolysis which about um which nine out

543
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,799
of the 11 um genes that encode enzymes

544
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,559
in this pathway which are here all

545
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:32,120
colorcoded were being co-expressed

546
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:36,039
usually picking around sunrise and

547
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:38,840
empowered or inspired by our reviewer

548
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:42,360
too we also went and looked

549
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,760
for the protein abundance across time

550
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,320
and we saw that some of the proteins in

551
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,840
the glycolysis pathway were also being

552
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,039
timely

553
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,799
regulated later on during the day so

554
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:58,799
more around Sunset we noticed that there

555
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,960
was this coexpression of a lot of the

556
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,720
blood Mill Associated genes which you

557
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,840
can see here as their profile in Orange

558
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,000
pecking be

559
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,679
before night onset and you can see the

560
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,159
each individual Gene profile very

561
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:18,799
beautifully rhythmic once a day and I

562
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,960
highlighted also two different genes

563
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:24,840
that we know are involved in modulating

564
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,799
malaria infection and showing these

565
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,480
beautiful rhythms so these are the pro

566
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:32,600
the genes en coding the proteins that I

567
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:36,360
mentioned that have are involved in anti

568
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,159
claing vasod dilation and

569
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,960
anti-inflammation but what about the

570
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,960
parasites parasites Within These

571
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,880
salivary glands have for a long time

572
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,880
been considered

573
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,320
quient and that is um that is also

574
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,760
because in part we couldn't really know

575
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,760
if they were um or they were fully

576
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,919
quiescent or just non-replicative

577
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:03,440
because the tools were lacking and so

578
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:08,520
image Bento from Maria mat's lab uh took

579
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:12,000
the lead to create a themine kyes

580
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:16,200
parasite that basically now allows for

581
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,760
detecting incorporation of edu analoges

582
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:23,279
to track DNA synthesis so the parasites

583
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,039
um lack these and so that was one of the

584
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,240
one of the reasons why cell cycle

585
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,559
studying Studies have been Limited inl

586
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,520
modium parasites but now we were able to

587
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:37,799
create this line and confirmed um that

588
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:40,519
they do replicate early on which is what

589
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:43,200
you have represented here on the red

590
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:46,320
panel you have the circles highlighting

591
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,799
the parasite uh and you see a lot of

592
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,399
little red dots in their nuclei early on

593
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:55,960
in the mosquito but then once we look in

594
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:58,399
the salivary glands parasites do not

595
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,519
incorporate uh this edu meaning that

596
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:05,279
they do not replicate within a 48 hour

597
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:08,159
window in which we assess uh these uh

598
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:12,000
parasites so they are really

599
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,919
nonreplicative during the salivary gland

600
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,039
stage but what about their gene

601
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,559
expression so what we find is that even

602
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:23,000
though they are not undergoing cell

603
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:26,039
replication they are very actively

604
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,240
transcribing their genes as you can see

605
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:32,320
here represented many of the genes so

606
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:35,159
you can see the raw data in Gray and the

607
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,799
Circadian algorithms fitted colors uh

608
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:41,679
over in red and

609
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:45,039
yellow so about 20% of parasite

610
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:48,480
transcriptome is under uh rhythms of

611
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:51,320
gene expression and that is uh many of

612
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,960
those 20% of genes are

613
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:58,159
encoding uh genes that are quite

614
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,159
important for parasite uh motility and

615
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,080
transmission and that's for example the

616
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,120
case of circum sporo uh Gene which is

617
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,480
the key Target of the two current

618
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,000
malaria vaccines and you can see their

619
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,120
profile here so we've been thinking

620
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,960
about

621
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,200
then if there are going to be rhythms of

622
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,240
transmission we could think first about

623
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:24,640
trying to assess um how exactly the

624
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:28,679
mosquitoes are feeding and uh choosing

625
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:31,200
that in the lab as as well as in the

626
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,799
wild the mosquitoes choose to

627
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,399
preferentially bite at nighttime and we

628
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,799
also were able to show that those that

629
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:43,279
actively fed they also are able to

630
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:48,159
ingest higher uh blood volume when we

631
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:51,600
monitor hemoglobin levels at nighttime

632
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,559
Additionally the the load of parasites

633
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,039
in the lever so the first organ that

634
00:29:53,559 --> 00:30:00,720
they go and infect is higher if

635
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:03,799
mosquitoes are allowed to feed during

636
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,480
that nighttime but this is a complicated

637
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:09,000
and complex phenotype right this could

638
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,080
be because either mosquitoes are

639
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,960
injecting more parasites at night or

640
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,519
whether the parasites are able to reach

641
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,200
or invade the lever more efficiently at

642
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,960
night or whether the host is just more

643
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,279
susceptible to infection at this time

644
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,760
and so to further dissociate these

645
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:33,240
different um possibilities we went and

646
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:37,399
studied in vitro and take take U

647
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,799
parasites directly onto aite and we show

648
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:41,519
again that transmission is also more

649
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:45,120
efficient at

650
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:47,600
nighttime and so to further disentangle

651
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,200
the contribution of a parasite clock and

652
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,840
a host clock we started doing a

653
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,720
mismatched infection so taking advantage

654
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,279
of uh

655
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:04,720
inverted uh inverted cycles of light and

656
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:07,840
dark we can have either infections from

657
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,480
morning or evening in either match or

658
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:16,039
mismatched conditions and what we see is

659
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:20,399
that uh infection is more uh efficient

660
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:23,039
in a matched situation at nighttime so

661
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,480
ultimately uh suggesting that both the

662
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:29,880
hose and the parasite clocks impact

663
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,760
infection efficiency and that perhap and

664
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,639
proposing that perhaps there has been

665
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,000
this co-evolution of clocks between

666
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:38,200
these three organisms to modulate

667
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,159
malaria

668
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,880
transmission so

669
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,559
altoe ciran rhythms of poost parasite

670
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,000
and Vector matter and together they

671
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:52,399
modulate the malary transmission and

672
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,440
pathogenesis and there are many um

673
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,919
outstanding questions that we are trying

674
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,519
to address uh we are highly interested

675
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,159
in understanding how are parasites

676
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:06,480
sensing time what are the evolutionary

677
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:07,679
pressures and host cues that drive their

678
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,480
rythmic

679
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:15,000
biology how does a mosquito clock impact

680
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,679
infection and of course on the parasite

681
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,679
side what are the parasites clock genes

682
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:25,840
that regulate their beautifully rythmic

683
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:28,080
biology these is um an very interesting

684
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,440
aspect of biology because circadian

685
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,960
rhythms have been described in organisms

686
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,919
across the Tree of Life Soo bacteria

687
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,120
fungus plants and animals but the

688
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:42,519
activators and the repressors are unique

689
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,679
so there's no hology they have been

690
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:47,760
evolved through conversion Evolution and

691
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:52,880
so we do not know what would be those

692
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:55,120
for these early carots protest parasites

693
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,919
but we hypothesize that it's still going

694
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,200
to rely on uh transcription translation

695
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,519
feedback loop because that is actually

696
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:09,679
conserved across your cariot but this is

697
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:13,120
still uh very much uh under exploration

698
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,639
so I would like to finish with that

699
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,080
perspective that we do think that the

700
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:20,519
circadian clock is Central to

701
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,039
pathogenesis and transmission of

702
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:27,559
circadian diseases s of sorry of

703
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:29,600
infectious diseases and that disrupting

704
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:31,559
the clock is likely going to be

705
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,720
disrupting the fitness of these

706
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:36,200
parasites and potentially can open new

707
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,120
ways for

708
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:43,600
interventions and I would like to finish

709
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,760
with um a call to action and so just uh

710
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,880
there are of course I've been telling

711
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,679
you all about parasites but there are

712
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,000
amazing work and research being done in

713
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,320
this circadian subfield of infection

714
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,600
showing that there is a lot of time of

715
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:04,240
day aspects of a bacterial load viral

716
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,840
load depending on the time at which

717
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,639
infection is initiated there's also um a

718
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,119
lot that we don't know and so if you're

719
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,560
interested I think this is quite an open

720
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,599
and exciting new feel but also even if

721
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,359
you're not uh particularly interested in

722
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:23,760
timing if you can just take something

723
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:25,599
from this uh conversation is that keep

724
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,839
track of when you're doing experiments

725
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:32,480
because time matters and finally we

726
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:34,720
would just like to thank my junior lab

727
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,200
especially Brian perington and rashing

728
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,879
Pascal and in bentu who led most of the

729
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,760
work I share with you today and our

730
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,000
funders thank

731
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,000
you that was very interesting I think

732
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,159
we'll go straight into questions uh but

733
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,119
before we go into questions in the chat

734
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,040
I'm just going to say that um there's

735
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,399
going to be a survey coming around and

736
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,440
the survey is to get your feedback on

737
00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:00,160
the talk so I'll drop that in the chat

738
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,800
but in the meantime we have a question

739
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,680
from Clarissa Schaefer did you test

740
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,480
different plasmodium species could their

741
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,839
circadian rhythms explain why they cause

742
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:14,839
different lengths of fever

743
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:18,119
Cycles yeah we have uh so in Mouse

744
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:21,040
models the most rhythmic plasmodium is

745
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:24,560
the one we chose and they have this

746
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,320
24hour rhythms but we are actually uh in

747
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,640
the lab trying to to test a little bit

748
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:32,359
of that like trying to look at different

749
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,480
now human plasmodium species that have

750
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:36,720
different lenses and trying to

751
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,520
understand a little further why would

752
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,680
that be the case we do not have an

753
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,359
answer quite yet but we are highly

754
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,359
interested in the same type of question

755
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:49,000
I think it's one of the big questions

756
00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:51,079
why different plasmodium species have it

757
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,440
done differently could it be that they

758
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:56,240
are just slower at the replication and

759
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,359
they are keeping track of when still

760
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,760
being exposed to the same cues as the

761
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,760
others but just take longer their

762
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,760
replication we don't know the answer

763
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,040
yet second question is uh from an

764
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,200
anonymous attendee really Co cool

765
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,960
findings on food entrainment since the

766
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,520
parasites are more prevalent in tropical

767
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,760
regions do we know if temperature can

768
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,640
also entrain their rhythms one night

769
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,640
night night parasite host infection in

770
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:28,720
mice considering that humans are dial is

771
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:31,680
it safe to say it will be day day in

772
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:35,200
humans yeah these are two two very

773
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,200
interesting comments and uh I do I do

774
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,000
have that preferred same idea of

775
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,520
temperature and that is because of many

776
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,079
different reasons I do think temperature

777
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:50,359
is in part responsible for the defect

778
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:53,319
here even on that food timing uh but we

779
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:55,760
and we have projects testing that also

780
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:57,240
there has in my sleeping sickness

781
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,400
project that I mentioned briefly I

782
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,200
didn't point that out but that was one

783
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,920
cue that we gave to the parasites in

784
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,880
culture and that worked so there is a

785
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,680
precedent also for temperature to

786
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,560
regulate uh rhythms uh in parasites

787
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,280
which I think it is quite possible that

788
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:18,160
it happens also to plasmodium in terms

789
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:21,440
of the the day and night aspect and mice

790
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:24,800
being nocturnal and humans dial uh that

791
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,440
is I think you could U anticipate that I

792
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,720
think you don't need to think about so

793
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:31,119
much if we start stop thinking about day

794
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:33,680
and night and start thinking about

795
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,520
activity and rest of the host I think it

796
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,520
matches very

797
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:49,240
well

798
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,640
interesting um I had another question um

799
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:53,160
if you were going to develop a

800
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,520
therapeutic or an intervention for this

801
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,720
how would you implement this into

802
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:00,440
therapy development this information

803
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,400
well I do think for example there's

804
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,000
could be two ways uh we can think of for

805
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,960
example let's give the example of the

806
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,040
surine treatment that I mentioned for

807
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,160
sleeping sickness right so um the the

808
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,560
treatment to sleeping sickness currently

809
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,720
is actually quite toxic so if we can

810
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,960
think about a time that you don't need

811
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:24,079
to use such a higher dose and you still

812
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,119
achieve the same um effect on the

813
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:31,319
parasite that could be useful right so

814
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,079
just defining when to give a drug would

815
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:36,520
have potential impacts either because

816
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:40,000
there's less toxicity to it or that you

817
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:42,800
can achieve better elimination of

818
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,440
parasites because whatever the target of

819
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,720
that drug is is highly expressed at a

820
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,480
certain time during parasite across your

821
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:54,720
day right so that could be the two very

822
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:58,040
simple actionable ways we can think

823
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:02,440
about these uh research having potential

824
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:05,800
in the intervention easy uh easily but

825
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:09,200
ultimately longlasting type of future

826
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,480
goal would be if you are able to show

827
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,599
what are the

828
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,359
molecular clocks of parasites and if

829
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:18,800
these are really Central to their

830
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:22,079
biology meaning that they allow them to

831
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,800
anticipate aspects of our own biology

832
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,040
instead of Simply responding to our

833
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,079
rhythmic biology but anticipating it

834
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,000
like other organisms have evolved to

835
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,359
anticipate the environmental predictive

836
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,839
cycles of their environment we could

837
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,000
then disrupt those clocks right and not

838
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,520
allow them to anticipate which will be

839
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,640
detrimental for their Fitness if that is

840
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,560
all true then you can start thinking

841
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,599
about having small molecules that also

842
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:53,000
act on these clocks and disrupt their

843
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,359
ability to anticipate and be less fit to

844
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,319
infect us hopefully tilting the scale to

845
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,319
the host to better control them

846
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,160
uh so we have two more questions um

847
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:09,119
claer again that was a super interesting

848
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,160
talk one more question if I may do you

849
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,400
have hypothesis on what factors

850
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,079
associated with food uptake influence

851
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,160
the parasitic Rhythm and what about

852
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,640
other physiological modulations such as

853
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,000
inflammation rate or sleep deprivation

854
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,920
did you test different lengths of

855
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,960
circadian Cycles shorter light and

856
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:32,720
darkness Cycles

857
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:36,880
um so on the first part so we have why

858
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:41,000
would food timing shift parasite timing

859
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,400
but it spreading the feeding would not

860
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,240
disrupt

861
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:50,920
rhythms what we have noticed is that if

862
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:53,599
you do the spread feeding intake a few

863
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,800
uh and this this is again a lot of the

864
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,400
work we've done it on plasmodium but we

865
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:02,839
also have done it with Victoria Costa

866
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:05,680
Rodriguez for um metabolism assessment

867
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:07,640
of liver right and what we know is that

868
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,839
once you give this spread out feeding

869
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:13,640
regiment a few for example hormonal

870
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:17,560
patterns like insulin become a rythmic

871
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:20,480
but a lot or spread out flat but a lot

872
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:24,000
of hormonal rhythms still become very

873
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,480
rhythmic with the normal um activity so

874
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,040
meaning that the same profile even if

875
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,599
you're spread it Still Remains the Same

876
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,760
some shift so I think there's going to

877
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,960
be a very

878
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:38,960
complex

879
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:42,880
um integration of that timing of feeding

880
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:45,160
that is happening in the the Maman body

881
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,760
that is not necessarily just about

882
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,920
nutrients right and so we do not know we

883
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:54,119
are having now a an approach to look in

884
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:58,000
vitro to try to now test each of these

885
00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:01,400
potential um hormonal rhythms nutrient

886
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,520
rhythms that it's a lot less convoluted

887
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,079
and intricate as it is in v in Vivo but

888
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:10,400
in terms of like the the second part of

889
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,400
your question could you remind me

890
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:19,880
Ricardo oops yeah sorry sorry yeah

891
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:21,240
second part of the question um so do you

892
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,000
did you test different lengths of

893
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,680
circadian Cycles shorter light and

894
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,359
darkness Cycles yes perfect and yes for

895
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:32,240
that we did

896
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:38,040
test by using so we tested in

897
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:40,720
Vivo uh also in our original um story

898
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:43,839
about this taking advantage of other

899
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,440
circadian mutants that have a longer

900
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,480
period so instead of having their

901
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,800
rhythms be 24 hours they have their

902
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,400
rhythms be 26 hours which actually about

903
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:57,200
five days in constant Darkness they are

904
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,960
now in opposite phase to the usual time

905
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,559
because they are like waking up think

906
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,880
about it that they would be waking up

907
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,960
later and later two hours a day and so

908
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,480
what we find is that the parasites fully

909
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,640
uh are synchronized to these long period

910
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,400
mutants we have now been doing in the

911
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:18,520
lab also with short period mutants and

912
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:23,319
uh and we are wanting to do that also in

913
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:26,200
vitro so for sure they are very much

914
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:30,200
plastic in their ability to integrate at

915
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:31,920
least in a normal range in terms of just

916
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,839
like you mentioned in terms of light and

917
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:38,400
dark Cycles uh very recent manuscript

918
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:42,040
from Sierra Reese's lab was testing

919
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:45,599
these with um environmental changes

920
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,599
instead of uh genetic

921
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,760
changes cool okay so we have another

922
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,000
anonymous attend very interesting talk

923
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,160
were you surprised to find that only 20%

924
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,359
of sport uh sporozoite genes seem to

925
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,920
cycle this seems to be a smaller

926
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,839
proportion than in blood stages or in

927
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,079
other organisms you

928
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:12,119
described well actually I was not

929
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:14,839
surprised I was excited because the

930
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:17,760
reason is that in the blood State

931
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:20,240
there's also the parasite replication

932
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,200
that is happening right and there is a

933
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,520
lot of the gene transcription profile

934
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,480
that is happening because of a cell

935
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,960
cycle and not necessarily about a

936
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,920
circadian cycle so I was happy to now

937
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,440
see a lot less uh

938
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,280
in being rhythmically regulated in the

939
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,480
parasites in the salivary glands where

940
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,440
they do not

941
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:47,480
divide 20% it is definitely a lot less

942
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:50,160
than 80% but it's actually at par for

943
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:54,000
example of the amount the percent of

944
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:57,040
genes regulated in the liver so our um

945
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,920
most well studied organ is the liver has

946
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,640
has about 20% of its uh trans cryptone

947
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,280
being rhythmically regulated and it

948
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:08,240
poses a major effect on our metabolism

949
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,960
right so it really 20% is still quite a

950
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:15,960
significant portion I probably would say

951
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:17,559
that uh in our body there's about 50% of

952
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,319
genes being regulated but it's not

953
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:22,200
necessarily in the same cell it is like

954
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,319
across many different tissues that

955
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:29,200
anywhere in our body that you would have

956
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:32,200
about 50 so it's actually around the the

957
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,200
expected

958
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,000
number so uh

959
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:50,720
sorry so if we don't have any other

960
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:53,359
questions we can move forward um thank

961
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,880
you again for this talk and I find it

962
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:58,000
super interesting have you applied it to

963
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:01,079
other tropical diseases zika virus was

964
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,440
very popular a few years ago um when I

965
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,880
was in the Caribbean so I was wondering

966
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,160
if you like looked at zika virus or if

967
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:11,200
you looked at any other mosquito born

968
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:13,280
illnesses uh I did not and I do I do

969
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,880
agree with you that this is quite

970
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,359
interesting and I would imagine that

971
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:22,599
other Vector born diseases are probably

972
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:25,079
going to be U having this pretty much

973
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:26,680
predicted expected time of day

974
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:28,680
transmission pattern that people have

975
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,480
known not studied we are not looking

976
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,880
into it but I would imagine that you

977
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,400
know and also another interesting thing

978
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:39,960
is that for example zika is transmitted

979
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:42,480
by AIS species meaning that is a dial

980
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:44,319
type of mosquito so I think that would

981
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,520
be quite interesting to look at the

982
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:49,839
salivary gland uh of these mosquitoes

983
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,880
whether blood meal Associated genes are

984
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:56,319
now with an inverted uh expression

985
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,800
profile I would predict so uh based on

986
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:01,000
their uh function and what they are

987
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,200
being regulated to do and I do agree

988
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,240
with you that this could be quite useful

989
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,480
to think about uh other viral infections

990
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:12,200
there are some studies that had been

991
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:16,119
done I think in vitro in terms of of

992
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:18,760
viral load meaning that the ability of

993
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:21,520
the virus to replicate inside the

994
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:25,280
mamalian cell that has been shown to be

995
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:28,800
rhythmic I think that is in many cases

996
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,599
expected right if you know our own um

997
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:33,119
replication Machinery a lot of the

998
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:36,119
pathways that the viral will need to

999
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:38,480
hijack to establish within our cells is

1000
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:41,520
uh dependent on host and if the host

1001
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,680
biology is rhythmic there is an expected

1002
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,559
link that was observed but it's

1003
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:49,480
definitely not being studied at all in

1004
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:52,839
the more mosquito side of

1005
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:54,640
things super interesting um I think

1006
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:56,680
that's it for now uh if we don't have

1007
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,680
any other questions we can uh log off

1008
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,000
but thank you once again for your talk

1009
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,440
and it was super interesting and it was

1010
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,480
really nice to see and and thank you

1011
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,599
again for doing this talk in light of

1012
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,920
everything that's been happening it's

1013
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,200
very encouraging to see thank you thank

1014
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,760
you so much I hope you guys continue

1015
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:15,079
these I think it's quite inspiring for a

1016
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,079
lot of people
