1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,480
good morning

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:14,320
everyone and welcome to the 27th

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,320
annual MIT Japan

4
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,720
conference May Steven

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,439
[Music]

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,320
P so the rest will all be in English

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,160
unless we're going to get some beer

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
later on and then then I can help you

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:37,520
out so 150 years ago um icho honma mit's

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,520
first Japanese student

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,520
graduated from the class of

12
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,760
1874 Japan and in particular their

13
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:51,600
Japanese industry has

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,680
been interested in education and

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Technology from MIT for a long

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,280
time now I'll bring us forward 140 years

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,600
so 10 years ago I joined MIT I left the

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,880
Aerospace industry and wanted something

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,119
flat and

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,320
Innovative and I was lucky enough to

21
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,159
start working with Japanese

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,439
companies

23
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,799
primarily and one thing I noticed was

24
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:22,759
that they were very focused

25
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,000
on

26
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,159
technology the

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,920
aperture for their

28
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,920
interests were somewhat extremely natur

29
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,320
narrow they were here on a scale of a

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,720
closed aperture to sort of more of a

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,759
wider one the core Market was what drove

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,759
their connection to

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,680
MIT now if we come along about five

34
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,040
years I started noticing the trend

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,159
changing

36
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:59,920
slightly everybody was aave about

37
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,159
startups but again the aperture was over

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,240
opening but somewhat still closed in the

39
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,920
sense that they were interested in the

40
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,920
technology that the startups were

41
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,879
creating two years ago I started

42
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,560
noticing yet another

43
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,280
Trend the Japanese industry was not only

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,840
interested in

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,840
technology startups but the ecosystem

46
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,319
itself a good progression though the

47
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,120
aperture was open

48
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,120
moving more to a transformational

49
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,480
market what I'll say the trend is going

50
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,640
to now is that they're interested more

51
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,400
along the

52
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,200
lines of how ecosystems are created the

53
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,000
processes the

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,640
procedures and you're starting to create

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,280
your

56
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:05,200
own the aperture is almost fully open

57
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:09,200
what I contend though is what's next for

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,760
Japan if you have a ecosystem in a

59
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,599
vacuum it's a great start but what my

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,280
hope for the Japanese industry and

61
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:22,879
thereby your nation and our partnership

62
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,879
is that we create a symbiotic Innovation

63
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,120
ecosystem now my talk is going to be the

64
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,799
non-technical talk of today

65
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,439
because what I

66
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,760
hope to draw from is from business and

67
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:41,599
hum's insight it's really the

68
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,080
relationships that you will be building

69
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,599
between these amazing professors these

70
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,959
amazing smaller companies that we

71
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,959
brought with us today and

72
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,319
yourselves so two professors are from

73
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,519
MIT that I'll draw from one is Tara

74
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,720
Schwarz she's a

75
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:00,680
neuroscientist and one is Kieran Setia

76
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,640
who is a philosopher in the humanties

77
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,959
department and then I'm going to draw

78
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,439
from the third who is a professor of

79
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,439
management at Kyoto

80
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:19,160
University so Tara draws her research in

81
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,560
Neuroscience to a conclusion that we

82
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,360
have to take care of our mind and body

83
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,360
our

84
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,639
brains we have to be open and have a

85
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,720
mindset that

86
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,720
is engaging and curious

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,800
then she assures us that even at old age

88
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,880
our neurons our neuroplasticity we can

89
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,639
change the way we think and I argue that

90
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,840
today is one of those

91
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,840
examples in trying to erase cognitive

92
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,320
biases now

93
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,759
Kieran has some of the same thoughts

94
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,199
which is pretty amazing because he's

95
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:02,600
really a basic philosopher at heart

96
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,160
but he talks about the

97
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:09,479
process over

98
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,479
goals and also having that open

99
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,600
mindset

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,199
in looking for

101
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,400
meaning over

102
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,639
achievement if we go back to the first

103
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,680
slide where I said a lot of the Japanese

104
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:27,280
companies I engaged with were focused

105
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,280
solely on the

106
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,080
technology as opposed to the inovation

107
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,720
Journey the process of learning from

108
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,720
these new professors or startup

109
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,400
companies now Professor

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,800
yuchi I find fascinating because his

111
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,840
research focuses

112
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,360
on the sushi

113
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:57,560
chef he's an ethnog an ethnographer at

114
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:01,160
heart and what he's done is assessed why

115
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:05,759
the stern somewhat angry looking sushi

116
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:09,039
chef still gets so many customers to

117
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,120
come and the magic behind this is he has

118
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:16,639
something called reflective

119
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:19,360
routines and actions shaping our

120
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,800
context so these actions that are deeply

121
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,280
embedded in the way we engage with each

122
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,680
other and I contend again that if you

123
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,560
use this methodology to engage with the

124
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,560
professors in the startup

125
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,680
the results will be this do we all know

126
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,680
who this

127
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,120
is so noou masah is one of the most

128
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,000
famous Sushi chefs or I would say at

129
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,400
least successful maybe you have your own

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,479
preference but he is somebody that has

131
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:57,160
engaged with the

132
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:59,879
client and the more open the client is

133
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,400
to new experiences

134
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,680
the better the

135
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,560
sushi the better the experience for both

136
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,039
parties the chef is allowed then to

137
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,319
experiment and do things that he or she

138
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:17,520
never dreamed dreamt of and the client

139
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,520
is then getting a world-class

140
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,120
experience so I think the result is

141
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,560
successful Innovations for you in the

142
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,919
future the MIT professors that we will

143
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,960
work with in the startup

144
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,639
companies I really believe there's a lot

145
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,319
of Promise

146
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:39,039
here and it all comes down to your

147
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,479
willingness to be creative have an open

148
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,680
mind and

149
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:47,599
allow that otaki that connection with

150
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,639
the sushi chef to give you new ideas

151
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,000
although they may not align

152
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:55,240
perfectly with what your technology road

153
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,240
map

154
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,240
has hopefully that would be a nice start

155
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,280
to

156
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,599
opening the aperture today on how to

157
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,800
engage with this amazing group and I

158
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,840
would lastly

159
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,919
say part of the networking is also

160
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,440
allowing you the opportunity to connect

161
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:21,919
with peers or competitors or forming new

162
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,919
Partnerships thank you very much
