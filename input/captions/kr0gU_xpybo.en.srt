00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,879
Hello and welcome back to Today I

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,880
Learned Climate, the climate change

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,800
podcast of the Massachusetts Institute

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,040
of Technology. I'm Laura Hessie Fischer.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,720
If you asked me, how do we make our

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,960
electricity cleaner and cheaper? I would

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,039
probably talk about solar and wind and

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,000
batteries and the promise of geothermal

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,480
and nuclear. I wouldn't start by talking

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,279
about the power lines running into the

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,520
homes along my block, but our guest

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,239
today makes the case that maybe I

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,399
should.

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,079
Look, transmission is not a sexy thing.

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,000
You know, it it doesn't have windmills.

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,680
It doesn't have cooling towers. It's a

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
nuisance. No one wants to look at the

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,600
lines. But I think it's probably the

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,800
single most important piece to improving

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,360
reliability and reducing costs.

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,039
That's Joshua Hajj. I'm the executive

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,280
director at the center for energy and

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,840
environmental policy research here at

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,120
MIT as well as the research director for

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,040
the MIT climate policy center. Mr. Hajj

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,280
is here to talk about upgrading our

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,439
transmission system. Basically, that

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,479
means building more and better power

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,680
lines in the right places. And there are

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,720
at least three big reasons to do that.

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,400
To make our power more reliable,

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,280
cleaner, and cheaper. But first, we have

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,080
to explain what exactly transmission

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,200
does because we usually focus on how

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,400
electricity is made, say by a coal plant

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,880
or a wind turbine or what it's used for,

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,439
like in our homes and businesses. Mr.

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,439
Hodgej is going to call these generation

40
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,159
and load. The transmission connects the

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,320
generation to the load. And those power

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,360
lines outside my window, they're just

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,920
the last stop on the way. More important

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,000
are the high voltage transmission lines

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,119
that you might see along the highway.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Strung from giant steel towers and

47
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,360
served by an immense network of machines

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,160
that direct and convert electricity over

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,920
hundreds of miles. And all of that

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,480
equipment plus the power plants

51
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,840
themselves need to work together to

52
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,599
perform a remarkable balancing act

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,760
to ensure continuous power to ensure

54
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,680
what we call reliability. Total

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,840
generation on the network must be

56
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,440
continuously and precisely matched with

57
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,520
load. If it's not, you risk outages and

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,520
blackouts.

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,080
You know how if you try to force too

60
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,959
much water through a hose, it just

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,760
spurts everywhere? Well, generating too

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,560
much power means electricity has nowhere

63
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,959
to go, and that can cause problems. It's

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,360
the job of transmission to make sure

65
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,800
that we always have exactly as much

66
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,800
power as we need. No more and no less.

67
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,319
People don't realize that we have

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,599
transmission lines stripped all the

69
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,360
time, but they almost never result in a

70
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,200
blackout. That's because these systems

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
automatically disconnect from the grid

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,200
when that happens and they have to

73
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,440
isolate those faults in milliseconds.

74
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,480
A bigger grid means you have more

75
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,120
options to reroute power when something

76
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,720
goes wrong. That's why upgrading our

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,280
transmission system gets us more

78
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,959
reliable power. And as cyber attacks

79
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,680
become a bigger threat to our energy

80
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,319
system and climate change brings more

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,800
big storms and wildfires that can wreck

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,200
power lines, we have more reason than

83
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,440
ever to brace for the unexpected.

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,040
And reliability requires that all parts

85
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,440
of the system operate as a single

86
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,760
machine from the generation plants on

87
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,080
one end to the load on the other and all

88
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,200
the equipment in between.

89
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,560
A single machine that is so large that

90
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,120
it crosses states and even countries. A

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,400
machine in which our power plants are

92
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,959
just tiny cogs. And it's a thinking

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,200
machine that's constantly solving

94
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,720
thousands of problems just so you can

95
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,239
turn on your dishwasher.

96
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,560
It's quite sophisticated and I think

97
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,439
generally underappreciated.

98
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,360
So it's really good at supplying power

99
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,040
for the early 20th century American

100
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,360
economy. I mean exceptionally good at

101
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,280
it. So it efficiently moves electricity

102
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,959
from large centralized power plants like

103
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,599
coal, nuclear and gas plants to urban

104
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,479
industrial centers or centers of load.

105
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,680
But today our economy is looking less

106
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,400
and less like that 20th century model.

107
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,479
For one thing, our electricity needs are

108
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,440
growing fast. Take the rise of AI which

109
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,720
needs big energy hungry data centers.

110
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,560
That is significant potential new load

111
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,479
that many regions don't have the

112
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,639
capacity to accommodate.

113
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,400
And at the same time, more people are

114
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,639
switching from fossil fuels to

115
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,720
electricity to heat their homes and to

116
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,199
power their cars. Now, that's good for

117
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,080
the climate and for our wallets, but it

118
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,160
adds even more to the load. And the new

119
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,800
power that we're building to meet this

120
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,919
demand. Well, in 2024, more than 70% of

121
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,639
it came from wind and solar. That is

122
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,199
very different from traditional coal and

123
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,919
gas and nuclear power, which can be

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,680
built right next to where it's needed.

125
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,520
So, you know, most of our wind

126
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,600
generation in the US is in the central

127
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,880
US, not necessarily close even to load

128
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,120
centers in those regions, let alone

129
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,120
other regions. Our best solar is in the

130
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639
southwest, pretty far from every load

131
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,479
center except the big cities in the

132
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,120
southwest. But we lack the transmission

133
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,880
capacity to deliver that high quality

134
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,080
renewable generation to where it's

135
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,720
needed. And so, you know, the bigger the

136
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,400
transmission system, the more diverse

137
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,000
wind and solar resources you have access

138
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,680
to, the stronger likelihood you have

139
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,199
access to electrons somewhere where the

140
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,880
wind's blowing and somewhere where it's

141
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,120
not cloudy.

142
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,240
This is why a bigger transmission system

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,960
can give us cleaner energy. We can build

144
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,360
as much wind and solar power as we want,

145
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,520
but if we can't get that energy to where

146
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,759
it's used, we're still going to have to

147
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,280
fire up our coal and gas plants to keep

148
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,160
the lights on. In fact, if a solar and

149
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,039
wind farm can't deliver electricity to

150
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,560
where it's needed, it shuts down. This

151
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:14,000
is what energy experts call curtailment.

152
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,759
There is a utility in Missouri that I

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,440
work with that has a lot of wind

154
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,000
generation northwest corner of the state

155
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,680
and they're continuously curtailing it.

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,400
I think it's almost just a nuisance for

157
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,840
them cuz again I mean if the wind was

158
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,240
blowing during a peak time and or the

159
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,120
wind was close enough to the load center

160
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,199
then then you'd be using it. And this

161
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,080
gets at why building out transmission

162
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,720
can make our power cheaper. Because the

163
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,639
larger the grid, the more easily it can

164
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,600
pull from the cheapest sources of

165
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,720
electricity, whatever and wherever they

166
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,440
may be. Today, the cheapest power is

167
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,520
often wind and solar, at least when we

168
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,520
can get it. But even when our power

169
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,600
comes from coal and gas, more

170
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,160
transmission helps us get cheaper

171
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,800
electricity from these sources. And this

172
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,440
flexibility is especially important when

173
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,160
the power is most expensive.

174
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,560
So I think you know big cities during

175
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,039
heat waves or big cities during

176
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,039
snowstorms right prices get very very

177
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,000
high. By expanding one's transmission

178
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,479
system you can access more sources of

179
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,720
generation and indeed in many cases

180
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,680
lower cost forms of generation which in

181
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,240
turn enable lower retail power prices.

182
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,120
So as a country, we must be in a big

183
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,520
hurry to build more transmission, right?

184
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,360
So it turns out that irrespective of how

185
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,720
people feel about climate change,

186
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,360
they're very reluctant to have any

187
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,560
energy related infrastructure built near

188
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,880
them, whether those are solar panels or

189
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,639
wind turbines, certainly high voltage

190
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,080
transmission lines.

191
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,520
Let's give you an example of what's

192
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,120
happening now in 2025 in the Northeast.

193
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,120
There's New England Clean Energy Connect

194
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,560
under construction right now in Maine to

195
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,919
bring hydro power from Quebec into

196
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,599
Massachusetts.

197
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,080
This is a good deal for the places at

198
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,400
either end. Massachusetts wants more

199
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,759
clean power sources like hydro, and

200
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,000
Quebec has more than they can use, but

201
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,319
most of the power lines are being built

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,639
in Maine, the state in between. local

203
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,400
and rural lawmakers, even if they

204
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,680
support energy development, they may

205
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,360
oppose running lines through their

206
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,680
districts if the local benefits aren't

207
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,039
clear. And that is something that we see

208
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,840
frequently with new transmission

209
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,919
projects. Siding and permitting is

210
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,520
mostly state level, which means crossing

211
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,120
multiple states can require permits and

212
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,039
approval from each other. Local

213
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,719
opposition such as environmental

214
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,880
concerns, land use disputes can delay or

215
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,800
kill projects. And you know, I had a

216
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,719
front row seat to all this in Maine

217
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,440
because I co-authored a paper on this

218
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,640
topic. And um a lot of people were

219
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,080
really upset that our paper showed this

220
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,600
line as reducing the cost of

221
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,200
decarbonization

222
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,360
in New England because from their

223
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,959
perspective, cutting down trees to build

224
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,080
a transmission line inherently hurt the

225
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,440
earth. So they would say things to me

226
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,880
like, "What you're saying doesn't make

227
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,959
sense. You can't save the earth by

228
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,040
destroying it." New England Clean Energy

229
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,800
Connect was permitted years ago. They

230
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,440
were legally allowed to to build it, but

231
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:15,200
it was delayed by years by lawsuits.

232
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,440
This is complicated. The people filing

233
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,640
those lawsuits were looking out for

234
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,640
their state, the towns and the forests

235
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,880
that the transmission lines are passing

236
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,959
through. That's more important to them

237
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,959
than getting clean electricity to a

238
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,959
different state. So, whose job is it to

239
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,640
look out for the transmission system as

240
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,959
a whole?

241
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,560
You know, a key challenge here is no

242
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,920
single entity can mandate or centrally

243
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,080
fund long-distance transmission is

244
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,160
pieced together regionally.

245
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,040
Even though transmission has to work as

246
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,920
a single machine, no one's in charge of

247
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,600
building or running the whole thing. And

248
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,839
when lots of utilities and grid

249
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,560
operators are each looking out for their

250
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,399
own areas, none of them are motivated to

251
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,320
fight or pay for new power lines. More

252
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,560
often, we build new transmission when

253
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,560
the system is on the verge of breaking.

254
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,279
When we've got a backlog of new power

255
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,959
waiting to come online, or a new batch

256
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,800
of AI data centers straining the grid,

257
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,880
we're reactive, reactive, reactive,

258
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,000
reactive. In fact, reactive is probably

259
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,640
being too gentle because we're reactive,

260
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,040
you know, many years after the the in

261
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,120
many cases the generation is ready to be

262
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,200
connected. Right now, we have thousands

263
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,959
of projects, mostly wind and solar,

264
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,839
waiting to connect to the grid, but they

265
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,800
can't because they're stuck because

266
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,000
there's not enough transmission

267
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,079
capacity.

268
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,079
Yeah. Right now, developers build wind

269
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,160
and solar where it's easiest and

270
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,279
cheapest, not necessarily where the

271
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,839
lines exist to carry that power. But

272
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,640
what if we planned ahead for this? What

273
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,839
if we made sure wherever energy is

274
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,600
cheapest, the transmission is waiting to

275
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,519
meet it?

276
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,360
uh positive example what can be done is

277
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,760
the competitive renewable energy zones

278
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,720
in Texas called Texas K.

279
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,440
KE was dreamed up in the mid 2000s when

280
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,680
there was hardly any wind or solar power

281
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,120
in the United States. But Texas

282
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,839
lawmakers noticed that windy West Texas

283
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,920
had a ton of energy potential. So they

284
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,480
put out a call for big transmission

285
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,160
lines leading out to this region even

286
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,640
before there was anything for them to

287
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,279
connect to. So it was completed over a

288
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,000
decade ago and

289
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,560
it was essentially built so that wind

290
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,720
generation in Texas was economically

291
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,000
feasible. Texas leads the US wind

292
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,399
production. It's got over 40,000

293
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
megawatts install capacity now which is

294
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,160
like over four Massachusetts worth of

295
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,800
power. And the whole reason that is the

296
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,320
case in Texas is because they were able

297
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,079
to come up with a pretty diverse

298
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,640
coalition that got something very

299
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,040
ambitious built. If this has worked for

300
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,079
Texas wind, can it work across the

301
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,279
United States? Well, after all, the US

302
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,720
has built big continent spanning

303
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:03,600
projects before. Take the railways or

304
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,360
our highway network. Both of which

305
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,920
wouldn't have been possible without a

306
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,279
big push from the federal government.

307
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,320
You know, we did it with the interstate

308
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,720
system. It's probably the best precedent

309
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,320
we have. And there the federal

310
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
government did a very good job of

311
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,399
convincing the states of economic

312
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,200
benefits of enabling facilitating this

313
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,639
interstate buildout. I think in a

314
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,120
regional grid across North America

315
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,519
enables us to imagine things like sun

316
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:37,040
electrons from Arizona going to Seattle

317
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,920
on a cloudy day. offshore wind electrons

318
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,440
in Massachusetts, enabling Quebec not to

319
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,800
have to use its hydro when the wind's

320
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,480
really blowing like crazy here and it's

321
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,680
super cheap. And then when the wind's

322
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,720
not blowing here, you can bring the

323
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,440
hydro down from Quebec. And you know,

324
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,120
because there are so many

325
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,279
economic benefits of expanding

326
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,240
transmission, I would love to figure out

327
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,399
some way to build stronger bipartisan

328
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,760
understanding. Hey, we may not agree on

329
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,000
how we're going to power this system

330
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,880
entirely, right? But we're all

331
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,240
interested in a more flexible, more

332
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,040
reliable, but most importantly, a

333
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,040
cheaper power system.

334
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,839
That's our show, but there is plenty

335
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,839
more of today I learned climate at

336
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,839
tilclimate.mmit.edu.

337
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,200
I have some important news to share

338
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,200
today. This season is my last as the

339
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,560
host of Tilclimate.

340
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,959
It has been an incredible joy and a true

341
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,440
privilege bringing the show to you all

342
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:41,440
for the past 60 episodes and I can only

343
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,399
hope that you've learned as much as I

344
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,880
have and had half as much fun learning

345
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,440
it. But this won't be the last time that

346
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,399
you hear my voice. We are planning some

347
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,519
bonus content to round out my time here

348
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,839
and also to introduce our new host

349
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,399
