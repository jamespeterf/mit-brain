1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,918
In here. They don't want perfection.

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:04,254
They want talent.

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,798
They want willingness to improve.

4
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,801
They want beliefs, conviction, values.

5
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:13,096
Show MIT how you are special.

6
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,473
Why you are special.

7
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:16,641
And you will be here.

8
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,228
Sometimes we just

9
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,856
feel that we don't have the capabilities.

10
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,441
We don't have the skills.

11
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:28,570
We are not good enough
and we just tell this story

12
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,991
one time
and add another, another, another.

13
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:37,162
And it's like, a recorded cassette
that we have in our minds.

14
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,915
We are capable,
we are smart, we are powerful.

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,044
And when we are determined,
we can do everything.

16
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,422
Remember how unique you are,
all the things that you've done.

17
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:53,511
And then if you made it so far,
why can't you go even further?

18
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:59,517
I actually postponed my application for a
while because of the fear of failure.

19
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,563
I believe that the first thing
you should make sure

20
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,859
is that you don't let the fear of failure
paralyze you.

21
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,820
The worst thing that can happen
is that you don't get approved.

22
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,655
And you know what? It's okay.

23
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,240
There isn't one person in my program

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,368
who did not have imposter syndrome.
Talk to your friends about it.

25
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:21,498
That is what makes it go away
is first of all, admitting it

26
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,043
Saying, hey, that's how I'm feeling today.

27
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,628
And then having your friends

28
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,005
lift you up from that

29
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:32,175
Sometimes we are hesitant

30
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,470
about taking a big next step.

31
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,598
We think a lot about everything
that can go wrong.

32
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:43,645
Those thoughts run a lot in my head
when I'm, like, facing a new challenge.

33
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,480
I think we need to look at the upside too.

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,691
All the things that can go
right. All the doors that it can open.

35
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,820
Women are not represented
in higher management.

36
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,865
We know that women are not represented
in senior roles,

37
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:59,702
especially women with children.
If more women come to these programs.

38
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:04,582
If more women say, yes, I am a woman,
maybe I'm a mother, maybe I'm not.

39
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,459
But I am putting my career

40
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,586
first because it's important to me,
because I can make

41
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,839
a difference in the world,
because I can do good in the world.

42
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,549
Then the world will be a better place.

43
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,636
We need women,
you know, in the workplace to shine.

44
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,972
I don't know how other ways
to say it.

45
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,517
a lot of times
maybe over the years, in the centuries,

46
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:26,479
you know, times have evolved and women
have shifted from different roles,

47
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,772
you know, more into the workplace.

48
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,233
But I think there's still a ceiling
that needs to be broken. Right.

49
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,902
Everybody was very courageous.

50
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:37,240
And has to be courageous for everyone
to actually pause their career

51
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,576
and say no to the promotion.

52
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:41,077
You know, in order to come here.

53
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:45,582
There was a moment of time
that people experienced doubts.

54
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,417
Am I doing the right thing?

55
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,087
Would I be able to continue my progression
when I go back?

56
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,592
Would I be able to pivot to
to where I want to go?

57
00:02:55,592 --> 00:03:00,263
I understand there would be many doubts.
I had as well, but,

58
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:04,642
it's the nicest gift
that I ever gave myself.

59
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:09,856
I hope if we can change one life,
if one woman that is watching this video

60
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:14,569
think she's not capable
or not up to the task.

61
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,864
And after viewing this video,
she convinced herself

62
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:22,493
that the first limitation
that needs to be removed is her own belief

63
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,455
We already made a lot of for these word.

64
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,666
In my experience,
it was like, I can try let's see.

65
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,835
I'm going to work towards that.

66
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,961
I didn't believe in me.

67
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,130
It was just exploratory

68
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,965
and the results?

69
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,760
It was, totally amazing.

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,178
I am here sharing this story.
