1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,640
okay good morning nice to see everybody

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,799
um I'm just want to begin by saying as

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,280
MIT considers the impact in the world as

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,719
you just heard through the climate

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,599
project we're also taking the Bold steps

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,039
to strategize and Implement exactly what

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,160
we're saying we want to do in the world

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,800
but on the campus in the context of the

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,960
city the state the nation and the globe

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,840
so I'm going to give you just a little

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,320
bit of a teaser today as to how we're

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,320
framing this the work we've been doing

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,320
over the past decade um but of course

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,480
there's always room for dialogue with LP

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,280
members you know moving down the line so

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,200
just before I start I just had a couple

17
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,520
questions and I'm going to jump in how

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,520
many of you have Chief sustainability

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,200
officers in the companies that are

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,600
present here

21
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,320
today okay great and how many of you are

22
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,800
chief sustainability

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,800
officers okay a couple of you and then

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,680
how many of you have zero carbon

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,600
commitments or Net Zero commitments okay

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,559
great a handful of you so there's a lot

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,640
of relatability between what I'm going

28
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,920
to share with you is our methodology to

29
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,719
many of you regardless of your higher

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,720
education or industry and that's one of

31
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,600
the lessons learned that we've had over

32
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,799
the past um decade working closely with

33
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,119
ILP members and with the MIT climate

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,640
sustainability Consortium so we've

35
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,200
deliberately designed our approach so

36
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,520
that we can enable the exchange of

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,880
strategy and best practices across

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,720
industry municipalities and other large

39
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,240
organizations so I'm going to share with

40
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,920
you a bit of that so when we look ahead

41
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,240
as we frame mit's commitment to

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,360
sustainability we're thinking about MIT

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,119
is a city within a city and it's

44
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,840
completely directly like one of the

45
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:37,640
first meetings I sat in when I got here

46
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,880
was not only with MIT but it was with

47
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,200
the city of Cambridge so we completely

48
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,920
understood our context in Cambridge

49
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,320
Boston and the greater Commonwealth we

50
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,000
don't need to go through all the details

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,399
but that's just to give you a sense as

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
you think about your organizations how

53
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,719
you might relate maybe you're one

54
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,159
building maybe you're a full

55
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:58,719
campus the underlying structure that has

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,079
driven my entire career and underlines

57
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,799
the work that we're doing and MIT is

58
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,880
what is the organizational structure and

59
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,280
behavior that is responsive to Alters

60
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,080
informs and influences the climate

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,160
trajectory that we're on as we heard

62
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,440
Chris kidle say earlier this isn't just

63
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,519
a matter of climate Tech this isn't a

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,959
matter of of one Silver Bullet that's

65
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,800
going to change the world these are

66
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:24,879
complex organizations with complex

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,400
people with individual needs that we

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,519
have to figure out what is the

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,519
responsibility of the organization and

70
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,800
what is the responsibility of the

71
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,599
individual so our mission that we set

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,519
out to accomplish at MIT just over a

73
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,920
decade ago is how do we transform MIT

74
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,319
that was number one which we're in the

75
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,840
midst of but how do we ensure that we're

76
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,680
doing it with a framework that's

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,560
replicable scalable generates just

78
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,159
Equitable applicable and scalable

79
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,959
solutions for these unprecedented times

80
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:56,080
that we just heard about and we do this

81
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,360
through a very collaborative process and

82
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,480
we Elevate diverse voices and it's

83
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,319
really hard some of the time a lot of

84
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,920
the time but we love it and we have

85
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,319
amazing Partners across the operational

86
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,560
academic research and innovators uh on

87
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,560
our

88
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,799
campus one of the unique at uh com value

89
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,599
ads that we made actually to the field

90
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,239
was that we actually didn't launch the

91
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,680
office uniquely on a platform or a

92
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,560
definition of sustainability we launched

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,640
the office on a platform of thinking

94
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,560
about scales of impact so we thought

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,799
deeply about what is it that we're

96
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,480
solving for how how do we solve we can't

97
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,720
solve for sustainability and climate as

98
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,519
an MIT as an island it was so clear that

99
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,720
we were thinking about what what we were

100
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,280
here for the students education all that

101
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,799
you heard about through Richard Lester's

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,040
introduction before in terms of what was

103
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,280
coming out of MIT but we're thinking

104
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,920
about the role of the campus in the

105
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,079
context of this complex City in the

106
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,959
context of the regulatory environment

107
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,560
within the city the people the shared

108
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:02,159
resources streets Etc in the context of

109
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,480
the unique state of Massachusetts

110
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,480
obviously the nation and the globe so

111
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,480
everything that we work on from Food

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,040
Systems to Energy Systems to materials

113
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,079
to the way we build our buildings we

114
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,439
think about climate resiliency is always

115
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,840
run through all of these lenses what has

116
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,840
to take place on the campus what do we

117
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,239
have to partner with with the city and

118
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,759
what has to take place within the

119
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,680
Commonwealth and in fact on Thursday for

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,120
those of you in the area we're hosting a

121
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,720
forum on decarbonization we're bringing

122
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,400
in the director of the energy transition

123
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,840
I for the Commonwealth the new climate

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,600
uh officer for the city of Cambridge and

125
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,440
myself and we're talking about what has

126
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,639
to take place collaboratively across

127
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,600
these three scales in this unique

128
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,960
regulatory environment where we all have

129
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,960
shared commitments of zero carbon by

130
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,800
2050 uh industry Partners May organize a

131
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,000
little differently at the higher

132
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,880
education we've what we've done here at

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,680
MIT is think about the campus as a

134
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,759
sustainable system the campus is a test

135
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,440
bed where we can take some risks we can

136
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,840
be demonstrable we think deeply about

137
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,960
leadership and capacity building from

138
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,800
the operational and implementation staff

139
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,479
to faculty students and researchers and

140
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,680
of course we're deep into collaborative

141
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,479
Partnerships and we work with

142
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,240
universities all over the

143
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,800
world so this is how we work we we

144
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,080
organized around these systems we're

145
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,520
connected around these areas in a very

146
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,240
prioritized way on the campus and then

147
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,600
we apply this cross our scales of impact

148
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,199
so again for today I'm just giving you h

149
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,560
a teaser of the of the pieces but this

150
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,759
is how this is how we work at MIT and I

151
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,360
hope this can you know either if some of

152
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,840
you are working in the same way please

153
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,080
reach out or if there's something that

154
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,520
can be shared with you again please let

155
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,199
us share that with

156
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,520
you so how we're solving for climate

157
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,360
sustainabil MIT is also quite unique is

158
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,360
that we use this term many uh industry

159
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,960
high education us use the term living

160
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,880
lab test bed but it's really to think

161
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,599
about how do we demonstrate this and

162
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,479
demonstrate the the challenges that we

163
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:11,800
what can we learn from what's happening

164
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:13,560
on the campus and actually apply it to

165
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,880
all the climate missions that you that

166
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,440
you learned about about today we are

167
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,680
deeply committed to zero carbon

168
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,479
emissions it can't happen tomorrow

169
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,919
because we've inherited 100-year old

170
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:26,400
infrastructure that's below grade that's

171
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,240
connected to steam and a range of old

172
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,720
buildings so we're really trying to

173
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,319
understand what does it mean to

174
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,840
transform all of our systems so in that

175
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,960
and I'll get into that in a moment but

176
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,240
in that way we we uh we have strategies

177
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,080
that connect with our research and

178
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,639
course engagement and then we involve

179
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,360
all of the operational and campus

180
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,440
infrastructure folks and we bring

181
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,759
everybody together in this campus's test

182
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,400
bed approach and what's unique about the

183
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,440
way we've done this is that the campus

184
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,599
and operational infrastructure folks

185
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,360
they need standards and guidelines and a

186
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,720
blueprint on how to do this and and they

187
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,840
need to understand what are the

188
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,879
innovative solutions we can pull down on

189
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,960
the campus without taking too much risk

190
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:08,319
because we need to provide electricity

191
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,479
chilled water and heating to the campus

192
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,639
247 in a resilient manner to all of our

193
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,400
staff students and researchers and on

194
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,360
the research engagement side in the more

195
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,120
traditional way we need research and

196
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,160
Publications they need revised and

197
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,280
updated models and also innovative

198
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,759
solutions and new businesses as you

199
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,160
heard about earlier so you can actually

200
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,800
bring these pieces together so all are

201
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:37,639
satisfied and it can lead to new ways of

202
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,199
solving how we scale this is a 10-minute

203
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,599
presentation in of itself but I thought

204
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,879
for the audience today this is a teaser

205
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,319
to just think about the unique ways and

206
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:49,319
how might you put your own organization

207
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,199
on this model and so on the left-and

208
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,680
side we think about you know this is how

209
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,840
I set up the office starting from zero

210
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,960
in 2013 of saying brought in to say how

211
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,440
do you launch an impactful program

212
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,080
and I thought about okay what's our

213
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,599
value add to the system and so this

214
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,400
might not be all of them but we have to

215
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,800
be able to forecast and stay ahead of

216
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,680
the curve for on behalf of MIT we have

217
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,080
to assess and reduce all of the risk

218
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,919
affiliated with a changing climate and

219
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,440
sustainability and how we frame that and

220
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,520
we have to scale the investment for

221
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,919
implementation so we can rationalize

222
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,599
where do we invest where do we hold back

223
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,919
and we need to leverage these strategic

224
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:27,360
Partnerships like we're doing in the

225
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,000
room today and there are many great

226
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,400
examples so we started with a long

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,039
and then we're moving up towards this

228
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,959
decarbonization by 2050 and thinking

229
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,120
through what are the Staffing how do you

230
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:39,599
build out the workforce what are the

231
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,959
educational outcomes what are the

232
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,120
businesses that can be rolled off how do

233
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:46,680
we influence the workforce of the future

234
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,320
in in the Commonwealth so that's our

235
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:53,399
framework and uh we're at as you can see

236
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,640
between the 2020 and 2025 area

237
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,800
there okay last piece I'm going to just

238
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,640
um share with you I won't have time to

239
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,120
get into all these but I wanted to share

240
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,680
with you how strategic we are and how we

241
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,680
think about the Implement framing

242
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,120
strategy and implementation of climate

243
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,680
sustainability structures so we have

244
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,480
what I've framed in seven parts around

245
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,279
inquiry and design via these driving

246
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,120
questions like I shared with you earlier

247
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,880
really always coming back to what are we

248
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,839
solving for how are we framing for this

249
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,839
so we think about working from common

250
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,760
scientific models Across The Institute

251
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,519
we think about we have to set goals and

252
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,600
plan across scales we Foster City

253
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,519
University Partnerships we lead through

254
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,279
collaboration and we have to hold

255
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,240
ourselves accountable we leverage as I

256
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,000
shared the campus as a test bed we have

257
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,320
to Center equity and Justice and of

258
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,680
course we're only the model is only as

259
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,360
good as the implementation to

260
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,839
demonstrate impact over time and so I'm

261
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,160
just going to share three of these with

262
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,880
you of examples of how we've activated

263
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,440
the campus as a test bed we've got a

264
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,600
campaign on connecting the dots and we

265
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,120
ask questions about like could m these

266
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
buildings become as smart as the people

267
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,959
who work in them as a way to bring

268
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,480
people in to strategizing on new

269
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,959
Behavior as benedetto mentioned in our

270
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,320
own campus we have dashboards and data

271
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,920
available to the entire MIT community on

272
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,079
a unique sustainability platform where

273
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,959
we have our we have flood models we have

274
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,079
heat models some of which was were built

275
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:24,360
with Miho that you learned about so we

276
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,440
can use the campus as a test bed to

277
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,480
inform the mission that you just learned

278
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,399
about U and we teach classes many many

279
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,519
of us have designed classes Kristoff has

280
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,320
designed one my I've designed one where

281
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,279
we're actually bringing our own

282
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,839
operational folks into the classroom to

283
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,720
say this is how things work on campus

284
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,920
all right and the final piece we have 18

285
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,560
climate and sustainability commitments

286
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,760
in action and that with over a hundred

287
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,480
uh faculty staff and students involved

288
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,480
in informing and implementing these

289
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,079
commitments across campus and we are

290
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,040
deep in our DEC decarbonization planning

291
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:03,160
to reduce our emissions by by 50 we have

292
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,200
a Net Zero by 2026 commitment in order

293
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:07,480
to think about well one in order to

294
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,560
comply with the city of Cambridge we're

295
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,200
aligned with our friends at Harvard and

296
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,519
we're deeply committed to figuring out

297
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,519
how do we have impact in the world while

298
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,519
figuring out how to reduce emissions

299
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,200
manage Legacy infrastructure and we

300
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,720
think about we're working on a plan that

301
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,079
will come out in the spring on

302
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,680
generation distribution and of course

303
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:27,839
reducing energy working with Kristoff

304
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,560
and his building energy models so I'll

305
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,920
leave you with that hopefully want to

306
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,840
learn more and hopefully there's

307
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:37,009
opportunity for partnership so thank you

308
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,009
[Applause]
