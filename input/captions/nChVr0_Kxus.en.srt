00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,810

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,860
CLAUDIA URREA: Welcome.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:11,060
It feels so wonderful
to be here, right?

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,520
As we officially launch
this portion of the agenda,

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,670
I want to recognize
and a warm thank you

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,610
to all of the students, all
of the MIT community members,

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,620
and our collaborators for
sharing their insightful work

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,830
during the showcases.

9
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,660
So thank you so much.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,090
[APPLAUSE]

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,040

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,480
I want to share a little
bit of my journey.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,410
I began climate-related
work at MIT

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,470
as I began my PhD in '98, with
Seymour Papert at the Media Lab.

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,860
And part of the work
that we were doing

16
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,090
was developing curriculum,
toolkits, technologies,

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,840
running professional
development,

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,120
and more importantly, running
innovative camps for high school

19
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,950
students around the world.

20
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:04,069
The most insightful
part was not only

21
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:06,000
what we learned
from those people,

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,320
but some of the work that
was transformational for me

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,180
came from Peter Senge and
from Linda Booth Sweeney.

24
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,850
And that work came from Sloan.

25
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,330
And it had to do with system
thinking and the relationship

26
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,720
that it has to learning, and
learning about the real world,

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,470
and what it matters and how
it matters for world learning,

28
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,790
for problem solving.

29
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,210
So I kept some of
those insights.

30
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,550
And that has been really
transformational for my career.

31
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:42,800
And just to quote Peter,
"Systems thinking is

32
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,590
a discipline for seeing
the whole rather than just

33
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,250
the parts, and for understanding
how things fit together

34
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,080
and change over time."

35
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,500
So understanding the
interconnectedness

36
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,190
of the work and the actions
that bring us together,

37
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,960
the power of collecting
efforts really

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,910
brings us hope today and brings
us together at this event.

39
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:11,450
As I prepare for this event
and talking to Peter this week,

40
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,750
he reminded us
that climate change

41
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,360
offers a unique
opportunity, because it's

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,470
the first time in human
history that all nations face

43
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,680
a common problem.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,980
And that's not always seen.

45
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,700
We have very little opportunity
to experience something

46
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,860
like that.

47
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,610
Leading this climate
work, Day of Climate

48
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,250
has been an honor this year.

49
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,380
We take this work
seriously, so I

50
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,700
want to acknowledge all
of the members of my team

51
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,410
that have been in support
of this work this year.

52
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,360
We come together to
acknowledge the urgency

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,370
of the current challenges
the world is facing.

54
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,130
We recognize the collective
work that many individuals

55
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,590
that I just mentioned,
in organizations

56
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,060
that represent them, are doing.

57
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,560
And I emphasize "recognize,"
because I feel like it's hard

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,370
to think about celebrating
when we need to recognize all

59
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,040
the work that is ahead of us.

60
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,350
I encourage everyone to
listen to our speakers.

61
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,330
They're here to inspire us.

62
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,890
They're here to ignite
our collective actions

63
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,610
towards a better future.

64
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,640
And they're here to
elevate the leaders

65
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,250
of tomorrow, you, young people.

66
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,790
Before I introduce
our first speaker,

67
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,040
there is an important
emotional dimension

68
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,010
that I want to highlight, and
it's the importance of love--

69
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,330
falling in love with
knowledge, falling in love

70
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,940
with learning, with action, and
with the people you work with.

71
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,413
So welcome, everyone.

72
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:49,660
[APPLAUSE]

73
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,900
ANNOUNCER: Please welcome
Chris Knittel, Associate Dean

74
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,000
for Climate and Sustainability,
professor of Applied Economics,

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,730
and faculty director of Day
of Climate and MIT CATE.

76
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,230
Woo.

77
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,785
[APPLAUSE]

78
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,660
CHRIS KNITTEL: Great.

79
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,860
Thank you very much.

80
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,800
One more round of
applause for Claudia

81
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,460
and the team for
pulling this off.

82
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,160
An amazing job
and amazing venue.

83
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,480
As was mentioned, my
name is Chris Knittel.

84
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,100
My main job here at MIT is I'm
a professor of Applied Economics

85
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,790
in the Sloan School
of Management,

86
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:25,770
but I'm here to represent
four groups around campus

87
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,090
that came together a few years
ago to develop a high school

88
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,140
curriculum on climate change.

89
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,820
So the first is, as I mentioned,
I'm a Sloan faculty member.

90
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,150
And it occurred to
me a few years ago

91
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,660
that we, at MIT, have a
lot of resources available,

92
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:49,080
not just to MIT students, but
to K through 12, more generally.

93
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,470
And that got me really excited
about potentially developing

94
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,320
a high school curriculum that
was based on MIT resources

95
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,060
and based on MIT research.

96
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,770
And that came together with some
other organizations on campus

97
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,970
that I'm involved with.

98
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,970
The first is the
Center for Energy

99
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,330
and Environmental Policy
Research that has been around

100
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,940
for almost 50
years, does research

101
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,850
on trying to understand the
costs associated with pollution,

102
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,650
the costs associated
with climate,

103
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,760
but more importantly,
what we can do to address

104
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,340
environmental concerns.

105
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,310
I'm also faculty
director of what's

106
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,390
a new center on campus, known as
the MIT Climate Policy Center.

107
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,380
And that's working hand
in hand with policymakers

108
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,840
at the state level,
the national level

109
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,060
and the international
level, to actually do

110
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,920
something about climate.

111
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,310
And then finally,
two years ago, about,

112
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,430
our president, Sally Kornbluth,
announced the Climate Project.

113
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,710
The Climate Project,
in her own words,

114
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,220
is an all of MIT
Climate Project that's

115
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,210
going to bring together all
the schools around campus, all

116
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,390
the disciplines to actually
have a meaningful impact

117
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,870
on the trajectory of climate
change over the next 10 years.

118
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,440
So I want you to keep
an eye on what we

119
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,740
do under the Climate Project.

120
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,950
But that all came
together to what

121
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,650
we call CATE, so Climate
Action Through Education.

122
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,750
It's a interdisciplinary
high school curriculum

123
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,230
that's science-based,
standards-based, and modular.

124
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,930
And most importantly, it's free.

125
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,000
And rest assured,
us, faculty at MIT,

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,720
did not develop the curriculum.

127
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:44,740
It would have been impenetrable
and certainly not be effective.

128
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,300
I had this vision of
a one week curriculum,

129
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,310
where every school just spends
an entire week across all

130
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,230
the disciplines on climate.

131
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,313
We met with some teachers.

132
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:57,022
And they said, well,
that would be great,

133
00:06:57,022 --> 00:06:58,500
but nobody would ever use that.

134
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,910
So at that point, I
said, we got to actually

135
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,630
go to the professionals here.

136
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,980
We have hired five
fabulous curriculum

137
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:12,080
developers that are current
Massachusetts high school

138
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,340
teachers.

139
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,350
If you go to the
CATE website, you'll

140
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,740
see 30 lesson plans that
are free to download.

141
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,200
Each lesson plan has
background material

142
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,660
for the teacher, background
material for the student,

143
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,550
some lab or assessment,
and more importantly,

144
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:35,070
a sheet of standards
that curriculum meets.

145
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,240
I wasn't going to say
this, but it really

146
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,100
speaks to the importance
of an event like this.

147
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,440
The actual reason why I wanted
to develop that curriculum is,

148
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,530
two years prior to that, my
dad, who was a high school math

149
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,420
teacher, got, in his mailbox,
a high school climate

150
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,870
change curriculum.

151
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,620
And he gave it to me
to look at, and it

152
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,800
was all climate misinformation.

153
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,540
So it just points to the
importance of us coming together

154
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,560
to share actual science-based
facts on the importance

155
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,780
of addressing
climate change, how

156
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,190
we can address it,
and more importantly,

157
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,970
understand its impacts
across society.

158
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,260
So it's days like
this, a day of climate,

159
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,260
that is just a small
stepping stone in actually

160
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,680
solving this worldwide dilemma.

161
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,039
And I look at all you,
kids, because unfortunately,

162
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,470
the old guys like me are not
going to be able to do it.

163
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,750
But I trust that you
will be able to do it.

164
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,419
So let's end by giving
yourselves a round of applause

165
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:43,539
for addressing climate change.

166
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,559
[APPLAUSE]

167
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,400

168
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,540
ANNOUNCER: Please welcome Pete
Bouchard, chief meteorologist

169
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,470
at NBC Boston.

170
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,253
[APPLAUSE]

171
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:57,461
PETE BOUCHARD: Hi, everybody.

172
00:08:57,461 --> 00:09:00,550

173
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,030
That's an old
picture of me, right?

174
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,580
Yeah.

175
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,280
Am I good?

176
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,540
Oh, I changed the slides.

177
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,220
Wonderful.

178
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,790
Thank you, everybody.

179
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,560
Wonderful to be here today.

180
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,500
It's a little drab out there,
a little cool, a little chilly.

181
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,080
Is it?

182
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,210
[INAUDIBLE]

183
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,060
Should I just turn this one off?

184
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,860
Nobody likes feedback.

185
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,920
So I've been on a little
bit of a time kick recently.

186
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,770
I think it's a little bit
because I'm middle aged now,

187
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,100
and I've got a lot
more years behind me

188
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,140
than I did have ahead of me.

189
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,840
I'll just shut this off.

190
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,582
I'll just take it out.

191
00:09:37,582 --> 00:09:44,030
So in the shallow surface that
I'm scratching here of time,

192
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,710
I learned that time is a little
bit of an illusion, right?

193
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,662
When we look ahead
into other galaxies,

194
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:51,620
when we look ahead to,
like with the James Webb

195
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,250
telescope, for
instance, or the Hubble,

196
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,720
you go look millions
of years in distance,

197
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,260
really, it's millions of
millions of light years away.

198
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,350
And you see those galaxies and
those objects as they once were.

199
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:14,330

200
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:19,400
MAN: Facing the
speaker a little bit.

201
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,540
PETE BOUCHARD: For the
purposes of this meeting,

202
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,860
I'm only going 15 minutes.

203
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,690
So even though time
is an illusion,

204
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,060
we still have a stick on it.

205
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,042
So back to the discussion.

206
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,350
And this is a little
deep too for some people.

207
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,073
But if you think about it, that
is the past you're looking at.

208
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:37,490
And it's hard to conceptualize
that because if you thought

209
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,727
about maybe a civilization
sending you a selfie,

210
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:41,810
it would take millions of
years for you to get it.

211
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,840
So you saw that selfie
as that civilization

212
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,440
appeared millions of years ago.

213
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,100
And when it comes
to you at that time,

214
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,572
it's millions of years old.

215
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:53,530
And the same thing if
you look into the future.

216
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,113
If we could travel
the speed of light,

217
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,650
we would go the speed of light,
and you'd go into the future,

218
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,490
in a sense, because
time would stop for you.

219
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,820
You'd come back, and maybe
a decade or two decades

220
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,085
would have passed
for you on Earth.

221
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:06,460
And you would have
aged on Earth,

222
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,330
but for you, it would
have been a blip of time.

223
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,170
And then we think of time
in the sense of the now.

224
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,150
There is only the now.

225
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,840
When we think of time and what
they conceptualize as time

226
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,490
is only now.

227
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,740
You can't go back to the past.

228
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,135
The future is undecided.

229
00:11:22,135 --> 00:11:24,510
And when I think about that,
I think about climate change

230
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,360
and how the now is probably the
most important part of where

231
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,150
we are.

232
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,650
Right?

233
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,130
Because we can't
change the past.

234
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:32,130
We're living on what
happened in the past.

235
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,028
And in the future,
it's still undecided.

236
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,820
We still don't know
what's going to happen.

237
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,750
But if we plan for the now,
if we plan for the future

238
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,600
and everything that we can do
to stem the tide of emissions,

239
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,200
do the work that
you're doing, we

240
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,530
can actually make a difference.

241
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,180
But we're at the precipice.

242
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,380
Time is short.

243
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,390
There's not a lot of it left.

244
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,420
We live in a bubble, right?

245
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,020
We are in a greenhouse.

246
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,340
Closed system.

247
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,950
You don't have a lot of
venting in that system.

248
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,700
The only way you can get rid
of carbon and greenhouse gases

249
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,298
is to consume them.

250
00:12:04,298 --> 00:12:06,090
And they take hundreds
of years, maybe even

251
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,930
thousands of years in
the case of carbon,

252
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,450
before it actually
is whittled away.

253
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,110
So that's the problem
we have going forward.

254
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,296
So the time to act is now.

255
00:12:15,296 --> 00:12:16,188
WOMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

256
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:17,230
PETE BOUCHARD: Oh, sorry.

257
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,540
My bad.

258
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,420
It would help.

259
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:19,950
[LAUGHTER]

260
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,478
So when we think about it,
now is the future in the sense

261
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:25,270
that if we don't do
something about it now,

262
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,500
the future is predecided.

263
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,960
And again, in my limited
knowledge of the human psyche,

264
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,630
I've gone into a little bit
of research on this too.

265
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,070
I took a course in Climate
Communication at Bentley

266
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,040
a few years ago, with a
great professor, by the way.

267
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,410
And shifting baseline
is one of the things

268
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,490
that the human mind goes
right to immediately.

269
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,940
Our grandparents' climate
is not our climate and not

270
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,860
the climate of the future too.

271
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,700
So when we actually
engage with people,

272
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,850
you have to take
that into account.

273
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,330
Climate change is something that
they perceive, but it's changed.

274
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,840
And right here at MIT, they
did research many years ago.

275
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,420
And it takes about five years,
in general, before temperatures

276
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,570
become unremarkable.

277
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,040
So you hit 78 in Christmas.

278
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,670
Big deal.

279
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,850
Becomes normal after a
period of five years.

280
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,620
It's normalized, unfortunately.

281
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,360
Climate change is also a
cultural cognition thing.

282
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,160
Unconscious process,
which causes

283
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,660
people to shape their beliefs
to dispute on disputed matters

284
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,730
of fact, based on their values.

285
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,840
So there's obviously, the
hype with the fake news.

286
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,720
The planet is warming
at an alarming rate,

287
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,980
not seen in thousands of years,
perhaps, millions of years.

288
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,343
And everybody's an
expert on this too.

289
00:13:40,343 --> 00:13:42,510
And there's another part
of it that I won't go into.

290
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,260
It's attribute substitution,
which is essentially,

291
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,850
if it's 90 degrees today, of
course, the climate is changing.

292
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,480
It's very warm.

293
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,750
But if it's 20 below tomorrow--

294
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,808
are you insane?

295
00:13:51,808 --> 00:13:52,350
That's crazy.

296
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,720
Of course, it's not.

297
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,670
Politicians would have
you think that there

298
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,560
are two Americas-- a blue
and a red America, right?

299
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,430
But in essence, there
are six Americas when

300
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,530
we talk about climate change.

301
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,750
There are the people that are
alarmed, that are concerned,

302
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,220
that are cautious.

303
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,743
And then there are a few that
are disengaged, agnostic.

304
00:14:11,743 --> 00:14:12,410
They don't know.

305
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,360
The doubtful ones, too,
and the dismissive ones.

306
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,080
So when you add those up,
that's 27% of the population,

307
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,710
but they get all
of the talk, all

308
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,040
of the chatter on social media.

309
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,630
They're the ones that
always troll, right?

310
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,547
They're the ones that
are always in your face.

311
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:27,990
They want you to disengage.

312
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,232
They want you to back away.

313
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:31,440
They don't want you to be
a part of the conversation.

314
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,540
They want to be
front and center.

315
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,130
But the vast majority of
people have your back,

316
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,130
when you think about it.

317
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,740
This is the latest research, by
the way, from Yale University.

318
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,900
This just came
out last December.

319
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,500
So this is very topical.

320
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,300
And when you think
about the people who

321
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,450
are interested in knowing
more with news stories,

322
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,650
and they want to know whether
it's happening or not,

323
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,020
74% of the population, when
you look at the country,

324
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,930
it's not blue and red,
it's not polarized.

325
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,030
It seems like a vast
majority of people,

326
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:07,370
even in states that don't have
a lot of knowledge about climate

327
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,430
change or maybe dismissive about
the idea of climate change,

328
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,020
they are engaged here.

329
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,400
They want to know.

330
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,200
And when you think about what
stories they want to hear about,

331
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,630
[CHUCKLES] it is
interesting at the bottom--

332
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,850
candidates for president.

333
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,810
And it's interesting,
at the very bottom.

334
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,820
Presidential candidates' plan
in response to global warming.

335
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,840
76% of the population wants
to know more about that?

336
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,490
I find that intriguing, too.

337
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:36,740
But generally, again,
the minority of people

338
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,280
are not at all interested, 20%.

339
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,140
And that's across the board
in news about climate change.

340
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,210
Katharine Hayhoe, a very
famous climate scientist,

341
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,260
had a great quote.

342
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,980
I mean, she balances what?

343
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,150
Life, and career, and faith,
which is involved in science,

344
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,510
and that cross, that is very
difficult to actually balance.

345
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,230
She had a quote.

346
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,810
She said, "The biggest
problem we have is not

347
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,518
the people who willfully
decide to reject

348
00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:05,120
200 years of basic science.

349
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,090
The bigger problem is the number
of people who say it's real,

350
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,660
but don't do anything about
it and don't think it matters

351
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,830
to them."

352
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,410
That's a vast, vast gap
that we have to close.

353
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,930
And that's the issue,
going forward, too.

354
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:22,490
So our issue is obviously
tapping into that.

355
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,570
But we live in a bubble.

356
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,780
We come to these conferences,
and we talk about it,

357
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,090
and then we leave, and we
go, oh, that felt good,

358
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,390
because we're with our tribe.

359
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,470
We're very tribal.

360
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,760
We're with our people.

361
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,960
We have backup.

362
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,850
We have common interests.

363
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,295
But obviously, there's 72%,
73% of the population that

364
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:40,420
still wants to know something
about climate change.

365
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,310
When you look at it in
a statewide perspective,

366
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,800
it comes down to the
blue and the orange here.

367
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,150
And you can see, some states
are dismissive of the idea.

368
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,500
And then here's the
tribalism involved.

369
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,490
Then you go down to the county
level and the little fiefdoms

370
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,070
in there.

371
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,290
And everybody just
squirrels away.

372
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,510
So it's about just homogenizing
the whole conversation

373
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,660
and bringing it out
there, and also making

374
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,030
it accessible to people
who really want to know.

375
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,849
And I think, by
staying in our groups

376
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:14,329
and staying within our
own like-minded people,

377
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,890
that we miss that
opportunity, I think.

378
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,710
And then the estimated
people, the adults

379
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,550
who think global
warming is happening,

380
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,619
wow, that's also pretty
enlightening too.

381
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:28,040
Again, in the 70%
change, in the 70%.

382
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,100
So that is the
challenge, going forward.

383
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,750
And obviously, it can be
a very difficult thing

384
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,030
too, when you're talking about
trying to change someone's mind.

385
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,130
There are people you will
never change their mind,

386
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,450
and I've run into those.

387
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,540
And so it's a waste of time
to engage in that sense too.

388
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,940
So there's a limit to
what we can tolerate,

389
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,170
anybody can tolerate.

390
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,620
It's a crazy thing
too, because some

391
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,505
of those that you
don't reach again

392
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,130
will want to come
after you, especially

393
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,370
if you're in the media.

394
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:01,750
But I find it interesting too
as the next generation moving up

395
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,502
is not really fazed by that.

396
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:05,210
They're still formulating
their opinions,

397
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,990
they're still with the idea
of what they believe in.

398
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,460
And what they believe in
is, the planet is warming.

399
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,630
We're going to do
something about it.

400
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,213
My generation wasn't
really like that,

401
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:15,140
and I feel weird about that.

402
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,440
But also, it does mean
that there's a lot of work

403
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,380
ahead, right?

404
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,260
And to quote another famous
professor, Professor Dumbledore,

405
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,587
for those who like Harry Potter,
"Dark times lie ahead of us.

406
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:26,920
There will be a time when we
must choose between what is

407
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,700
right and what is easy."

408
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,470
Obviously, it's
not an easy task.

409
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,310
There's a lot of work ahead,
and there's a lot of dark times.

410
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,970
And that can be a little bit
more on the anxiety level.

411
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,450
And that is a big thing too.

412
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,890
Doomism is a thing
in climate change.

413
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,920
If you go, and you
doomscroll, as they say,

414
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,330
the climate discussions,
the job is overwhelming.

415
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,970
You can fall into
a spiral, and there

416
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,178
can be no coming out of that.

417
00:18:52,178 --> 00:18:54,120
Climate anxiety
isn't dismissive,

418
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,950
and it shouldn't be
dismissed, it's apparent.

419
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:02,400
And it, honestly, can fall on
the lines of race and gender

420
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,050
too.

421
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,300
This graphic too, also
from Yale University,

422
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,120
shows that Latinos
are mostly affected

423
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,717
by this, 17% of those who
think it's an overall issue.

424
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:18,300
And some of that is severe, some
of it is moderate, some of it

425
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,940
is mild.

426
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:25,350
Gen Z, there you are, and the
millennials, male versus female.

427
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:30,030
Gen X, honestly, do throw
the weight of my generation

428
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,030
upon my shoulders.

429
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,400
It does feel like, we
saw the train coming.

430
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,060
We heard the sirens,
the gate went down,

431
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,480
and we didn't do much about it.

432
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,850
It feels like we didn't
really get engaged.

433
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,355
Not to defend it, but some of it
might have been the fact that we

434
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:47,230
didn't have a lot of
information in the '90s.

435
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,480
I remember going to conferences,
and it was just like,

436
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,738
we sat around and were
like, we're pretty certain,

437
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:53,530
it's warming, but our
models weren't great.

438
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:55,080
They didn't simulate the
atmosphere as well as

439
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,910
they do now, which is
all the more reason

440
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,932
to believe the data, right?

441
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,890
And it is funny too,
because I saw the program,

442
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,720
and I saw, it said, Pete
Bouchard, climate activist.

443
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,790
And I'm like, I had
to pause for a second.

444
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,680
I thought, am I really?

445
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,150
Have I really done enough?

446
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,700
I mean, I go to conferences,
I speak about it a lot.

447
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,940
But it is something
that you think back,

448
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,410
and there's always
something you could do more.

449
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,930
You can always really
take up the cause.

450
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,710
And again, it's your
generation inspiring

451
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,560
mine and inspiring me to
come to these conferences

452
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,570
and talk to you about it too.

453
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:33,020
But anxiety, and climate,
psychological distress

454
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,830
is also something, I think, that
is playing a role in what we're

455
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,390
seeing now with
social media and how

456
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,190
we perceive how we're
going to go forward,

457
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,460
how we're going to attack
this whole subject matter.

458
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,770
And it is necessary
for you to find help

459
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,370
if it really does bother you.

460
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,890
And it's OK to step back, right?

461
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,270
I do woodworking on the side.

462
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,853
And sometimes, I get
really tangled up

463
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:56,582
in some of the geometry or
the joinery that I'm doing.

464
00:20:56,582 --> 00:20:58,290
And I actually have
to step away from it.

465
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:58,890
And I come back to it.

466
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,510
And I go, wow, what
was I thinking?

467
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,010
Right?

468
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,520
Because that can be something
that can be regenerating to you.

469
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,870
And fall back on your peers too.

470
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,280
That tribalism,
that's your core.

471
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,340
When you go out
there in the open,

472
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,530
and you're expanding
your horizons,

473
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,710
and you're confronting these
people, it's OK to fall back

474
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,960
and say, hang on,
I need a second.

475
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,910
So if the planet
could speak to us,

476
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,660
what do you think it
would say these days?

477
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,160
Right?

478
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,280
If we personified the
planet, it probably

479
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,590
would say, what are you doing?

480
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,950
And also, does it feel a
little warm in here to you?

481
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,583
Right?

482
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,500
Those are the things
that you can think about.

483
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,000
But also, it might
be saying, thank you.

484
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,960
For the people who are
doing the work out there,

485
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,770
stay hopeful, and
don't give up hope.

486
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,370
Thanks.

487
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,821
[APPLAUSE]

488
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:54,050

489
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:54,550
Again.

490
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,140

491
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,490
ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome our panel,

492
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,530
moderated by Margaret
Wang-Aghania, executive director

493
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,720
and cofounder of
Subject to Climate.

494
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,199
[APPLAUSE]

495
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:27,572

496
00:22:27,572 --> 00:22:29,280
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA:
I hope that works.

497
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,780
OK.

498
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,560

499
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,460
Great.

500
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,540
Well, Thank you
all for being here.

501
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,660
And today symbolizes
a lot of great things.

502
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,930
It symbolizes the day of
climate resources launching,

503
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,250
which is fantastic.

504
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,030
But I also think it
symbolizes how we

505
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,230
democratize climate knowledge.

506
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,730
And in the place where I
think makes the most sense

507
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,990
in the classroom.

508
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:59,630
And also, what it symbolizes is
not only upcoming Earth Day, not

509
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,530
only Earth month, but I think
it shows that this is something

510
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,960
that we need to be
teaching every day,

511
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,970
needs to be integrated across
all grade levels and subjects,

512
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,870
because our students, and
our learners, and our kids

513
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,060
deserve to learn about
the world around them

514
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,180
and what's happening.

515
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,090
And it's not something
we leave it just

516
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,170
for them to solve on their own.

517
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:23,010
It's something that we all work
intergenerationally together.

518
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,140
And the classroom is
a great way to start.

519
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,290
So I used to be a teacher.

520
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,120
I used to be a social
studies teacher.

521
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,460
And I saw how it
activated my students.

522
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,150
And now, I run a nonprofit,
called Subject to Climate,

523
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,990
where we help educators
integrate climate into all grade

524
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,140
levels and subjects.

525
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,770
So I'm very excited
about this panel,

526
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,390
because studies show that
if you teach about climate,

527
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,580
it'll lead to immediate
carbon reductions.

528
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,100
And then also, students
change their parents' minds,

529
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,460
and it'll also affect
their communities

530
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,910
because they'll take action.

531
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,670
So I'd love to hear directly
from learners, students,

532
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,730
and educators.

533
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,305
So if we can welcome them with
an applause, and we'll get

534
00:24:05,305 --> 00:24:05,805
started.

535
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:09,110
[APPLAUSE]

536
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,060

537
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:14,570
So first off, I would love for
you all to introduce yourself,

538
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,230
what you do, and what inspired
you to get involved in climate.

539
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,470
Was there an aha moment or
something that happened?

540
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,530
And we can start
with you, Naima.

541
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,400
NAIMA SAIT: Yup.

542
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,340
Hello, everyone.

543
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,600
Thank you for being here.

544
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,240
My name is Naima Sait.

545
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,350
And I'm a former high
school French teacher.

546
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,650
And yeah, so on
the personal level,

547
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,170
I am originally from
North Africa, Algeria.

548
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:45,040
And in 2018, just watching the
region from a lot of villages

549
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,060
burned to the ground
due to forest fires.

550
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,850
So that was very devastating.

551
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,800
And then in the classroom,
as a French teacher,

552
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,210
I had a lot of English learners.

553
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,690
And then coming
to the realization

554
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:06,820
that a lot of those students
did not have access to one class

555
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,910
that the high school offers,
environmental science class,

556
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,770
but they were fluent in French.

557
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:16,660
So I took advantage of that
and started teaching fact

558
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:22,090
about climate change in the
classroom in all levels.

559
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,840
And then realizing
during that journey

560
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,670
that a lot of those students
were also part of a youth hub,

561
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,860
Sunrise in Somerville.

562
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,260
And they had their
little community.

563
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:41,790
And yeah, from there, it was
a long journey of figuring out

564
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,960
in the classroom what we can
learn about climate action

565
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,700
at the local level, but also
how they can take that and do

566
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,750
more local climate advocacy.

567
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,270
Yeah.

568
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,490
And I will talk more
about that later.

569
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,297
So it's all these
different things.

570
00:25:59,297 --> 00:26:00,880
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA:
That's amazing.

571
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,030
And you can learn it in French
class as well, which I love.

572
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:07,210
And then love to hear from
your perspective, Laelia.

573
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,160
What about you?

574
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,880
LAELIA MAYNOR: So hi,
my name is Laelia.

575
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,510
I'm here with the Center
for Systems Awareness, which

576
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,980
is a compassion-based
education reform nonprofit.

577
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,570
I'm a product of
public institutions.

578
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,500
I went to public school my
entire life in a very small town

579
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,960
in Northern California.

580
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,290
And for me, the pull
towards climate change

581
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,820
wasn't necessarily
an aha moment.

582
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,390
I was raised in a
spiritual practice that

583
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,770
values the environment
and protecting it.

584
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,190
And alongside growing up
in the redwoods, which

585
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,560
are the tallest living things
on planet Earth, they're trees.

586
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,920
And I feel a great
amount of respect

587
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,700
and very humbled by them.

588
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,550
So for me, protecting
the environment

589
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:51,280
and going towards climate
education wasn't a moment.

590
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,437
It was more of a
moral imperative.

591
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:55,270
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA:
That's very powerful.

592
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,190
Thank you, Laelia.

593
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,530
And Sophie, you represent
another student perspective.

594
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,787
So what about you?

595
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:01,870
SOPHIE SHEN: Hi, everyone.

596
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,800
My name is Sophie.

597
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,120
I use she/her pronouns.

598
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,920
I'm so excited to see so
many young faces here today.

599
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,790
I'm a student at
Arlington High School.

600
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,970
I'm a senior,
graduating this year.

601
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,840
And I run the Slash the Trash
team, which I cofounded,

602
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,150
which basically,
we do a lot of work

603
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,000
about diverting our lunchroom
waste into composting,

604
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,670
recycling, trash.

605
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,780
And we also do a lot
of education work.

606
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,960
So we do environmental
justice presentations

607
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
for high schoolers.

608
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,190
And we also do
work about learning

609
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,130
about how policies
impact our environment

610
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,200
for elementary schoolers.

611
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,320
I guess, for me, the reason why
I'm so excited to be here today

612
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,260
is because I've had so many
great educators in my life, who

613
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,070
have taught me a lot
about the climate.

614
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,860
I remember, all the way
back to elementary school,

615
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,335
my green team at Dallin
Elementary, shout out--

616
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:52,710
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA:
[CHUCKLES]

617
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,890
SOPHIE SHEN: --Rachel Oliveri.

618
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,723
She's our school
sustainability coordinator.

619
00:27:55,723 --> 00:27:58,560
And she helped out
with the green teams.

620
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,400
I remember this one very
memorable experience

621
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,100
where we learned about milkweed
and how monarch butterflies

622
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,640
thrive off of milkweed.

623
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,785
And so I'm really excited
to talk to you all today.

624
00:28:09,785 --> 00:28:11,160
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA:
Wonderful.

625
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,710
And speaking of
sustainability coordinators

626
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,130
and admin level,
Dave, what about you?

627
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,380
DAVE KRAMER: That's what I do.

628
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,840
My name is Dave Kramer.

629
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,470
I am the director of Green
Programs at a school called

630
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,520
Boston Green Academy.

631
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,020
Shout out to my colleague, Dina,
right there in front of me.

632
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,860
She's from Boston
Green Academy as well.

633
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,000
At the school, they
call me Big Green Dave.

634
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,660
I don't know if I earned that,
especially with other guests

635
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,480
here today.

636
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,960
But I think I became passionate
about climate and sustainability

637
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,410
education as a result
of a gradual process.

638
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:48,680
I grew up in Florida, which,
clearly, now is very vulnerable,

639
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,780
went to college in New
Hampshire and really fell

640
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,190
in love with the outdoors,
and mountains, and whatnot.

641
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,920
But the main catalyst
for me was moving

642
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,100
into the country of Colombia,
and teaching there right

643
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,190
out of college.

644
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,630
It opened a whole
new world to me.

645
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,952
And I saw ecosystems at
every different altitude,

646
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:08,660
all these different
areas in the country,

647
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,630
different cultures that
really sparked my curiosity

648
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,270
and interest.

649
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,380
So I tried to bring that
back to students every day

650
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,560
and try to work to
help young people care.

651
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,910
I think, a lot most people
care, and just to highlight it

652
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,930
in their day to day.

653
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:28,220
And also to spark
curiosity, wonder, and awe.

654
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,930
I'm really honored to be here
today, so thanks for being here.

655
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,430
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA:
It's amazing.

656
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:35,120
And so we hear a
lot of themes of

657
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,830
lived experiences,
connection to nature.

658
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,290
A lot of times, that's
what sparks climate action

659
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,040
and interest in climate.

660
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,980
So I want to start off with,
we have two educators here.

661
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,460
So I want to learn more about,
how have you integrated climate?

662
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,760
Or how have you seen other
educators integrate climate

663
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,850
in the classroom?

664
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,620
And what are the effects
that you've seen on students?

665
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,803
And we can start this
time with you, Dave.

666
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:03,470
DAVE KRAMER: OK.

667
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,660
Go right back down.

668
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,870
At Boston Green Academy, anyway,
I think we do a lot of work

669
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,030
to integrate climate,
and sustainability,

670
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,590
and environmental justice across
different classes and Susan

671
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,530
curriculum.

672
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:19,660
For example, we have a tradition
called green exhibitions

673
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,480
at the end of the school year,
where teachers may complain

674
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,570
in the planning process.

675
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,390
It's a lot of work,
but they basically

676
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:28,990
let go of their regular classes
for two or three weeks, some,

677
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,920
even longer, and have an
interdisciplinary approach

678
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,520
to looking at everything from
food justice and food systems

679
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,320
to intersectional issues
related to climate and justice.

680
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,475
And our youngest
students look at,

681
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:45,100
what does it mean to
be a green school?

682
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,350
And how can we make it better?

683
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,390
And I invite them to
bring suggestions.

684
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,330
I think, also, just one
example of a teacher that does

685
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,510
an awesome job in our school is
our 12th grade Green Engineering

686
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,250
and Physics teacher,
very project-based.

687
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,310
And we actually
have a student who

688
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,890
is starting an internship
at the Zero Waste Program

689
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,450
in the city of Boston, who
told her just a couple of days

690
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,780
ago, this school pushes
sustainability and climate all

691
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,930
the time down our throats.

692
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:12,680
But you know what?

693
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,740
This project, where I had
to use upcycling and do

694
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,620
a shark tank-style
presentation really

695
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,512
taught me that this matters,
and it was really enriching,

696
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,220
and I'm looking forward
to my internship.

697
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,420
So that right there
was just proof

698
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,130
that kids may complain
along the way,

699
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:33,800
but a lot is seeping in
through teachers and others who

700
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,830
are trying to weave
climate sustainability

701
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,942
across every subject,
including French.

702
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:41,150
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA: Great.

703
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,480
And I had the privilege of
visiting the Green Exhibitions

704
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,990
in Boston Green Academy.

705
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,260
And if people are
interested, they

706
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,700
will talk to you
afterwards and invite you.

707
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,660
It is really great to see those
different interdisciplinary

708
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,390
projects.

709
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,480
And also, visiting Boston
Green Academy is great too.

710
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,673
There's the hydroponic
freight farms as well.

711
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:03,840
DAVE KRAMER: We're in
Brighton, I forgot to mention.

712
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,250
But yeah, we have
a freight farm,

713
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,380
which is a retrofitted shipping
container for growing vegetables

714
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,110
all year long, and finally,
serving that in our cafeteria,

715
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,610
too.

716
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,030
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA: Yeah.

717
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,100
Who wouldn't want that in
their classroom, right?

718
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,990
That's a real skills like that.

719
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,980
They're learning.

720
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,960
And so, Naima, what about you?

721
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,970
I know that you
were in Somerville.

722
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,160
NAIMA SAIT: Yes.

723
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:28,060
So as I said, I was a
classroom French teacher.

724
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:32,430
And at first, they just started
teaching about climate change

725
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,450
in all the levels.

726
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:41,640
And then my students started
asking for specific things.

727
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,760
They started to
feel very powerless

728
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,220
in terms of what we can do.

729
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:54,120
So they asked that we focus
on what we can do locally.

730
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,950
They really took ownership
of their learning.

731
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:01,360
And I will just mention a
few things that they've done.

732
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,750
They hosted the Climate Panel.

733
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,640
And they invited educators.

734
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,210
They invited student
climate activists.

735
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:14,730
They invited city staff from
the Office of Sustainability

736
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,940
and also some climate
activists in the community.

737
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,965
And we're asking them questions
about all sorts of things,

738
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:26,710
like, how many trees
are we planting?

739
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:30,840
What can we do to create
more sustainable modes

740
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,340
of transportation?

741
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,660
And green roofs.

742
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,470
They even had an
elected official,

743
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,140
so they asked about ordinances.

744
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,240
And what we can do
at the city level.

745
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,440
So that was really
inspiring because they

746
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,040
invited the whole school.

747
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:53,640
And they were also trying
to recruit more students

748
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:59,580
to join the climate hub that
they created in the community.

749
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:04,570
And outside of the classroom,
they did a lot of things.

750
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:09,960
One, they decided to put a
questionnaire together and make

751
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,940
endorsements during elections.

752
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,510
So they put climate
platform together,

753
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,630
endorsed candidates for
mayor, for city council,

754
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,630
and had them commit
to certain things,

755
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:27,449
that they will do everything
to offer free blue bike

756
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:31,679
passes for staff, for
students, that they

757
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,960
would be more funding for parks
and a lot of other things, even

758
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,790
green roofs, which
is part of zoning.

759
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:44,409
So it was very inspiring
to watch them do that.

760
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:49,050
And also, they worked with the
teachers, we'll get to that part

761
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,620
later.

762
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,850
I was part of a teachers union.

763
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,310
And they worked
with their teachers

764
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,180
to push the district
of Somerville

765
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,840
to start a path towards
mandating climate change

766
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,580
education in all
subjects and grades.

767
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,340
Actually, that was negotiated
during a teacher contract

768
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,560
negotiation, and
it passed, making

769
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,100
some of the first city in
Massachusetts to have done that.

770
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,700
So we're still at the very
initial phase and still figuring

771
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,025
out how to do that, but--

772
00:35:21,025 --> 00:35:23,910
[APPLAUSE]

773
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:24,830

774
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:29,240
This was a collaboration
between teachers and students.

775
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,085
And that was very,
very powerful.

776
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:32,460
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA:
All right.

777
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:35,122
And I remember, that's
when we met Naima,

778
00:35:35,122 --> 00:35:38,030
when I found out about
Somerville public schools

779
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,230
having climate change
be a requirement.

780
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,810
And this really gets
us back to, this

781
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:44,670
is an intergenerational,
collaborative effort.

782
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,240
And oftentimes, we
walk into this problem,

783
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,800
saying, oh, my gosh, there's
so much we don't have,

784
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,340
but I'm here to show
you that we need to look

785
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,700
at an asset-based approach.

786
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,590
Look at how much we
do have right now.

787
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,900
These are just two
amazing teachers,

788
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,700
educators with their stories.

789
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,810
And I want to now turn it over
to our learners, our students.

790
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,970
And so for students,
what about you?

791
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:10,530
How has learning about climate
impacted you and influenced you?

792
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,290
So we'll start with you, Sophie.

793
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,040
SOPHIE SHEN: Yeah.

794
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,910
So growing up, I've never
really known a time,

795
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,730
where climate change hasn't
been an existential threat

796
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,420
to our globe.

797
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,570
And so I think that that has
formed a lot of the career path

798
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,290
that I've decided
to take in life.

799
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,140
I see a lot of,
as we were talking

800
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,530
about like interdisciplinary
connections between government,

801
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,040
literature, and the
climate, and so I'm

802
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,390
really interested in town
government, like Naima is.

803
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,250
I interned at our
Department of Public Works.

804
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,530
And I'm now an elected official,
as town meeting representative.

805
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,590
Oh, thank you.

806
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,790
[APPLAUSE]

807
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:56,270
And I think, learning
about climate change

808
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,640
has inspired me to
take action on a wider

809
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,330
systemic level in that sense.

810
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,913
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA:
That's amazing.

811
00:37:01,913 --> 00:37:05,570
And just you're seeing like
it's not just a science problem,

812
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,280
there's so many layers.

813
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,540
And Sophie has really
been able to leverage

814
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,670
what she's learned in
social studies, for example.

815
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,180
And Laelia, what about you?

816
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,410
LAELIA MAYNOR: For me,
it seems paradoxical,

817
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,900
but I actually
gained a lot of hope

818
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,940
through my climate education.

819
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,150
The climate education program
that my organization puts on

820
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:29,930
goes deeply into the
social and emotional aspect

821
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,570
of the climate crisis.

822
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,850
I know, like Sophie,
I've struggled

823
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,540
a lot with climate anxiety,
and depression, and doomism

824
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,440
of my public life.

825
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,330
Public officials
aren't doing anything.

826
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,830
The companies aren't
doing anything.

827
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,570
How are we ever
going to change this?

828
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,990
And being able to critically
reflect on my own thought

829
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,810
processes and feelings have
allowed me to show up more

830
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,980
presently in these
climate spaces,

831
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,640
alongside learning about
the amazing initiatives

832
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,880
that students, and teachers,
and just people across the world

833
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,220
have done that have deeply
changed their local ecosystems.

834
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,715
It's very inspiring.

835
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:04,090
And I would say,
just the ability

836
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,710
to stay present in
the work I do has

837
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,960
been the greatest skill I've
gained through my climate

838
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,147
education.

839
00:38:09,147 --> 00:38:10,730
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA:
That's amazing.

840
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,010
And that's a important thing.

841
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,800
I know Pete talked
about climate anxiety.

842
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,560
And one thing is that,
when you teach about it,

843
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,990
you can also teach
about the solutions.

844
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,600
Because also quoting Katharine
Hayhoe, which Pete did,

845
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,110
is that Katharine
Hayhoe talks about,

846
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,580
it feels like you're
pushing a boulder,

847
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,380
but when you're
doing a little bit,

848
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,090
you feel like you're
making progress.

849
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:36,650
But when you see other people
joining you, you're not alone.

850
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,710
And that can be the difference
from anxiety to hope.

851
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,360
And so, again, we
hear all these stories

852
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,510
from educators and students, and
they're doing amazing things.

853
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,640
And so we need more
of this in classrooms.

854
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,030
So in your all's
perspective, what

855
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,130
is needed to accelerate this?

856
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,470
Like, bring climate
change education

857
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,100
to schools and communities.

858
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,260
And we can start with
Sophie this time.

859
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,010
SOPHIE SHEN: Yeah.

860
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,920
I guess, maybe to
touch a little bit more

861
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,110
on what I was saying earlier
about multidisciplinary

862
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,090
and interdisciplinary
learning, I guess,

863
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,880
I want to give a quick shout
out to the CATE program that

864
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,830
was also presenting today.

865
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,890
I'll see a lot of
the ways in which we

866
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,890
can talk about climate
through different angles,

867
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,348
and that makes it
more approachable

868
00:39:18,348 --> 00:39:20,600
for different students who
have different aptitudes.

869
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,940
And so, for example,
in literature classes,

870
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,870
we can talk about romanticism
and environmental preservation.

871
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,370
We can talk about
how infrastructure

872
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:30,530
bills in our government are
impacting our environment.

873
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,080
And so I think it's
really important

874
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:36,400
to lower that barrier to entry
by engaging students with topics

875
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,320
that they are already familiar
with, already passionate about.

876
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,467
And I think that's a
great way to introduce it.

877
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:43,300
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA:
What about you, Dave?

878
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,850
DAVE KRAMER: Yeah, I think
I would agree with that.

879
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,290
I think that fundamentally,
climate change education is not

880
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,700
a STEM, science and math, issue.

881
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:57,340
I think I've had people
talk to me and think

882
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,820
that I must be a
science educator.

883
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,300
I was an English major
and an education minor,

884
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,470
then an environmental
policy in grad school.

885
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,860
I think that it takes
all the angles Sophie

886
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,520
mentioned to tackle this.

887
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,120
And different people
get hooked into it

888
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,970
by different personalities
in their classrooms

889
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,810
and different subjects.

890
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:22,290
I also think that teachers are
very unlikely to incorporate

891
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:25,170
without standards like
Somerville's or the state

892
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,510
of New York or
New Jersey, right?

893
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,570
I think, if anyone here wants
to advocate at the state

894
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,220
level in Massachusetts,
I know Margaret

895
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,230
would be willing
to help you, but I

896
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,130
think we really need to mandate
climate change as standards

897
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,820
across the board in education.

898
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,970
And that will make it a
lot easier for teachers

899
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,120
to be able to do it.

900
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,360
Even though it adds more
work, it's just something

901
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,802
that they have to do.

902
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:48,010
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA: Right.

903
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:52,830
And again, this idea of, there's
just so many requirements of,

904
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,357
how can we bake it in
into what they're already

905
00:40:55,357 --> 00:40:56,440
going to have to teach in?

906
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,200
Standards are what they
already have to teach.

907
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,035
And Laelia, what about
your perspectives on this?

908
00:41:03,035 --> 00:41:04,410
LAELIA MAYNOR: I
went to a school

909
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:08,040
in a very small rural
town in California.

910
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,680
My community has the highest
rate of childhood trauma

911
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,700
and an above average
rate of poverty.

912
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,520
So kids show up to school, and
they're not ready to learn,

913
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,050
they're not ready to be engaged.

914
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:21,450
So I see, the intro to
climate solutions in schools

915
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,930
is to radically invest
in students' well-being

916
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,230
and academic needs.

917
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,720
So showing up with
food security,

918
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,050
housing security,
and a community that

919
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:35,730
is focused on creativity
and a passion for learning.

920
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,850
Communities in the US that are
most affected by climate change

921
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:41,500
are Black, and brown,
and poor communities.

922
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,020
These are the
students that we need

923
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,550
to invest in to
make sure that they

924
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,010
are ready to show up and
engage in the content

925
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,510
that we are giving them.

926
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,190
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA:
That's amazing.

927
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,090
NAIMA SAIT: Yeah.

928
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,220
So what would be some of the
things that were already said?

929
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,110
Because it's important
to, yeah, say it again,

930
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:02,280
mandating climate education
in all subjects and grades.

931
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,280
And what it means is, you
need funding for that.

932
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,330
So one, at the state level,
the adults in the room

933
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:15,390
reach out to your
state representative.

934
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:20,010
There's a bill at the state
level for exactly that.

935
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:23,870
So if that bill is
passed, district

936
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,520
would be able to get that
funding from the state.

937
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,920
So that's one thing.

938
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,680
At the local level, get to
know your school committee

939
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,390
representatives as well,
because in Somerville, again, we

940
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,220
started that
journey, but it does

941
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,810
require a lot of
funding to train

942
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,000
teachers to buy curriculum.

943
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,570
So making sure that
every year, there

944
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,420
is a budget that's
dedicated to that.

945
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,760
And teachers are being
paid for this work.

946
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:58,340
So these are few things that
we can do at the local level.

947
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,690
And I think we've gotten a lot
of different advice on-- these

948
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,260
are things that can
help accelerate.

949
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,820
And so maybe you're thinking,
OK, this is amazing.

950
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,210
What's my next steps?

951
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:10,170
What do I do next?

952
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:14,120
So in closing, I'd love to
ask our panelists to share

953
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,010
just a lightning round.

954
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,690
What's your call to action?

955
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,690
What's your advice for
people listening here,

956
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:23,730
who are like, OK, I understand
that this is what is needed,

957
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:26,790
but what can be
my very next step?

958
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:30,592
And yeah, to start with.

959
00:43:30,592 --> 00:43:31,800
DAVE KRAMER: I'm happy to go.

960
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,508
And we'll just go down
the line, I guess.

961
00:43:33,508 --> 00:43:36,870
I would say, honestly, come
visit schools, go to schools,

962
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:39,290
come to Boston Green Academy,
go to other schools that

963
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,100
are doing this kind of work.

964
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,520
I don't think you can
advocate for change

965
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,120
without knowing what it's like.

966
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,180
Some days are really
heavy in schools.

967
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:51,770
And everyone needs to understand
that and match the energy

968
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:55,035
with what you can recommend.

969
00:43:55,035 --> 00:43:56,160
But you're welcome to come.

970
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,500
And as Margaret
said, if anyone wants

971
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,917
to talk to me about end of the
year events, we have a lot.

972
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:03,553
And they're fun.

973
00:44:03,553 --> 00:44:05,720
SOPHIE SHEN: I guess, just
to call back to something

974
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,115
that Mr. Bouchard
was saying earlier,

975
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:09,990
there's a lot of
misinformation in the world.

976
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,480
So teachers, keep
doing your job.

977
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,510
And students, be willing to
engage with that material.

978
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,550
And there are so many
ways to get involved.

979
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,330
That could be starting
a community garden.

980
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:21,980
They can be great community
hubs, great learning spaces.

981
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,490
That could include advocating
to your local or your state

982
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,280
government.

983
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,170
They're super accessible,
a lot of times.

984
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:31,332
And that's a really great
way to get your voice heard.

985
00:44:31,332 --> 00:44:32,540
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA: Great.

986
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,623
LAELIA MAYNOR: For
individuals, I really recommend

987
00:44:34,623 --> 00:44:36,090
checking out on-road simulator.

988
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,670
It's what the UN uses to
predict climate change.

989
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:39,980
It was developed here at MIT.

990
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:42,330
And for schools
and organizations,

991
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:44,840
I highly recommend collaborating
with your local Indigenous

992
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,540
community.

993
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,540
The tribes have been the
stewards of these lands

994
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,330
for so long.

995
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:50,600
And they have an
intergenerational relationships

996
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,140
within their community.

997
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:54,580
They really know how to
work with your community

998
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,970
and what your community needs.

999
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:59,770
So set up a meeting with
your tribe, tell the stories,

1000
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:03,310
and learn how they
take care of the land.

1001
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,360
NAIMA SAIT: Yeah.

1002
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,190
For students.

1003
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,970
I will say, try to find
community within your school

1004
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:14,020
and also within your city.

1005
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,510
Work with your teachers.

1006
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:19,460
We have done it in
Somerville, and it worked.

1007
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:27,970
So yeah, just other things
is join a local climate

1008
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:31,210
hub, the Sunrise.

1009
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:35,050
That's just an example, but
there's a lot of other ones.

1010
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,292
Yeah.

1011
00:45:36,292 --> 00:45:37,750
MARGARET WANG-AGHANIA:
And I think,

1012
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,000
one thing that I'll
ask everybody to do

1013
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,354
is, after this, I think the
first step is talk about it.

1014
00:45:44,354 --> 00:45:46,730
Somebody who's
not in this event,

1015
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:49,960
share some of their stories,
talk about what you learned.

1016
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,460
Some of the flyers that
you gotten of resources,

1017
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,520
bring it up to your
friends, your teachers.

1018
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,270
And that's where we start
when if we talk about it.

1019
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,850
So thank you, all,
so much for this.

1020
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,460
And I hope that
you learned a lot

1021
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,130
and walked away with
some action items

1022
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:09,130
on how you can help be part
of this movement of climate

1023
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,934
education, and therefore,
climate action.

1024
00:46:11,934 --> 00:46:12,892
DAVE KRAMER: Thank you.

1025
00:46:12,892 --> 00:46:16,126
[APPLAUSE]

1026
00:46:16,126 --> 00:46:21,340

1027
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:23,930
ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome Aladdibe Joroff,

1028
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:27,370
deputy climate chief at the
Governor's Office of Climate

1029
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:30,737
Innovation and Resilience.

1030
00:46:30,737 --> 00:46:31,570
ALADDINE JOROFF: Hi.

1031
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,430
[APPLAUSE]

1032
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:35,650
Thank you.

1033
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:36,620
Hi.

1034
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,600
Wonderful to see so
many people here.

1035
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:43,000
And thank you for inviting
me to join you tonight.

1036
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,990
It's a hard panel to follow.

1037
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,360
But I will say,
what was inspiring,

1038
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,450
as many people
often ask, how do I

1039
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:50,890
get involved in climate change?

1040
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:52,150
How can I make a difference?

1041
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,250
We just heard a lot
of inspiring ways.

1042
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:57,660
Showing up at an event
like this is one as well.

1043
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:59,850
Learning about climate
change is what's

1044
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,460
going to help give us all,
as individuals, the tools

1045
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,280
to address climate change,
whether it's reducing emissions,

1046
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,650
so that we lessen the
impacts of climate change,

1047
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,110
or dealing with
the impacts that we

1048
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:12,220
know are already going to see.

1049
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,220
So some of you may remember
when recycling started.

1050
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,955
A large part of the
reason that got going

1051
00:47:16,955 --> 00:47:19,080
was students, like in
elementary and middle school,

1052
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,650
we're taught about recycling.

1053
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:21,300
They went home.

1054
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,040
And every time their parents
put a can in the garbage can,

1055
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,680
they would go and take it out,
and put it in a recycling bag.

1056
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,290
Same thing with
turning off water when

1057
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:29,680
you're brushing your teeth.

1058
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,370
Some of these things start
with the youngest generations

1059
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:36,210
teaching everybody else and
making it a habit in our lives.

1060
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:40,030
And as individuals, our actions
around climate change matter.

1061
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:43,200
And it can be as inspiring as
becoming an elected official

1062
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,480
and joining causes,
but it can be

1063
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,580
things we do in our daily
lives individually as well.

1064
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:51,860
And I say this because climate
change can feel overwhelming,

1065
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:52,360
right?

1066
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,150
It is a very large global issue.

1067
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:57,310
But if we think about
just a few examples.

1068
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:01,530
So in the energy sector, we
know the most cost effective way

1069
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,150
of reducing emissions
is to use less energy,

1070
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:06,900
so turning off the light
when you're not in a room.

1071
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,870
In the transportation sector,
if there's public transportation

1072
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:13,960
available, taking a bus or a
train instead of a car ride,

1073
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,580
that can reduce emissions.

1074
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,150
And you may feel when
you're doing that like,

1075
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,458
is that so significant?

1076
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:21,000
But when you look
on the bus, and you

1077
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,040
see the 20 other passengers,
you think, oh, that's 20 people.

1078
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,040
And there are 20 other
buses going around my town.

1079
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,443
And there's 20 other towns
in my state with bus systems.

1080
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:30,610
And there's 50 other states.

1081
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:34,290
It's collective that our
individual action matters.

1082
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:38,290
And I'll just reference, there
was a study, it was in 2009.

1083
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,300
So the data may be a
little out of date,

1084
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,980
but the principle is the same.

1085
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,090
And it studied what they
call the behavioral wedge

1086
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:47,007
from household activities.

1087
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,840
And it said, things
that we, as individuals,

1088
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,490
can do in our homes, not
high technology lifts.

1089
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,590
We're not talking about
adding heat pumps.

1090
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:57,630
Things we can do in our
behavior can collectively reduce

1091
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,820
approximately 7 and
1/2% of US emissions.

1092
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,600
So that's just things
we can do at home.

1093
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,250
And then on the
resilience side, when

1094
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,920
we think about
increasing storm events,

1095
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,310
heavier rains, if you
walk around streets

1096
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:14,890
and see the storm drains on
the ground, those grates,

1097
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,830
they're designed so
the water flows through

1098
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,000
during a storm event.

1099
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,500
Well, particularly
like in the fall,

1100
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,180
when the leaves are falling,
if those get clogged up,

1101
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,740
the rain doesn't go down.

1102
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,360
It pulls back onto the street.

1103
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,000
And when it gets really bad,
it goes into people's houses.

1104
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,920
It can flood streets, homes.

1105
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,130
So if you're walking by, you can
just use the side of your foot,

1106
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:36,070
clear it off from the sidewalk
side, not the street side,

1107
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:36,910
be safe.

1108
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,550
But there are
studies about this,

1109
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,950
where there was a village
in England that had a really

1110
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,640
significant flood event.

1111
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,740
And they did an analysis
afterwards and said,

1112
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,000
if we clear off this
system of storm drains,

1113
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,860
we think that would
solve the problem.

1114
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,370
And the next time they had
a same size weather event,

1115
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:54,620
they didn't have any flooding
because they proactively

1116
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,140
had volunteers going out and
clearing out these grates.

1117
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,500
And you don't need special
equipment or anything.

1118
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,640
So there's a lot we
can do individually.

1119
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,610
And as we already
heard, we are all

1120
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:09,630
or will become consumers,
voters, officials.

1121
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,590
We are peers.

1122
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,090
We talk to our
friends and families.

1123
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:15,950
There's a lot of ways
to engage and influence.

1124
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:18,150
And I'll say first, people
who are still studying,

1125
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:20,820
no matter what classes you're
taking or career you go into,

1126
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:24,260
you are going to have some
interaction with climate change.

1127
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,760
Our prior speakers
were just talking

1128
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,920
about the really
interdisciplinary nature

1129
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,730
of studying climate change.

1130
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:33,060
It's true when you're
working as well, right?

1131
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,990
You may be working on
priorities like housing

1132
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:39,900
or economic development,
biodiversity, equity.

1133
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,360
They are all affected
by climate change,

1134
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,310
and climate change
can affect them.

1135
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:47,180
So we really need this
integrated approach,

1136
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:51,210
where we look for synergies and
how we maximize our cobenefits.

1137
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:52,980
If we're going to
take an action,

1138
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,460
how do we do it in a way
that's good for climate change

1139
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,950
and improves affordability,
and public health, and equity?

1140
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,620
Why not go for lots of
good things at once?

1141
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,720
But let's keep climate
change in the mix,

1142
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,530
because it's always going
to be there and have a role.

1143
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:09,020
And this is part of the
reason Governor Healey created

1144
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,450
the Office of Climate
Resilience and Innovation

1145
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,880
was to integrate a whole
of government approach

1146
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,610
to climate change, to make
sure we do not accidentally

1147
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:19,460
silo these issues and
really think about how

1148
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,250
our actions interweave.

1149
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,380
And you'll see in the
title, "innovation"

1150
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,950
is part of the title.

1151
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,890
That's because climate
change is a challenge.

1152
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:30,750
It also presents opportunities.

1153
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,930
And one of those is innovation.

1154
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:35,460
Massachusetts has been
a leader in innovation,

1155
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:38,040
and MIT is obviously
a large part of that.

1156
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,950
Innovation is at
the heart of MIT.

1157
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,790
So we want to look for
those opportunities.

1158
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,270
We don't just need
to take action.

1159
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:46,310
Let's make things
better at the same time.

1160
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:48,350
If we're going to have
to do a lot of work,

1161
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,580
what more can we get from it?

1162
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:52,660
Let's be really creative
in what we're doing.

1163
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:56,020
And again, an underlying
piece of all of this

1164
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,890
goes back to, I
think, why we're here.

1165
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,780
Having climate change in our DNA
of analysis and decision making

1166
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:05,860
requires a lot of education,
a lot of knowledge.

1167
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,790
And I'll just say,
on a personal level,

1168
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,608
when I grew up in
the area, so I took

1169
00:52:09,608 --> 00:52:11,650
some of the middle school
and high school classes

1170
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:14,090
that MIT offered before
I came to school here.

1171
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,620
So I will add my personal
thanks to all the volunteers,

1172
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,930
and staff, and faculty
who make these courses

1173
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,620
and these programs possible.

1174
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,580
It's really important.

1175
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,440
And I really appreciate
the work everyone's doing.

1176
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,815
And I hope, everyone
in this room

1177
00:52:25,815 --> 00:52:28,100
keeps moving forward
as climate activists.

1178
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,535
So thank you, all, so much.

1179
00:52:29,535 --> 00:52:32,900
[APPLAUSE]

1180
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,900

1181
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,300
ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome Yashasvi Raj, PhD

1182
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:42,040
candidate at the Center for
Climate Repair at the University

1183
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,340
of Cambridge.

1184
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:46,672
[APPLAUSE]

1185
00:52:46,672 --> 00:52:48,305

1186
00:52:48,305 --> 00:52:49,430
YASHASVI RAJ: Hi, everyone.

1187
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:50,860
Hope you can hear me all right.

1188
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,740
I want to start off
with my PhD research

1189
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,120
by showing you this
really iconic photograph.

1190
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,910
I'm sure, a lot of you have
already recognized this photo.

1191
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,280
This photo is called Earthrise.

1192
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,620
And it was taken in 1968 during
the Apollo 8 lunar mission,

1193
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:08,060
by Astronaut William Anders.

1194
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,630
And this was a really
impactful photo at the time,

1195
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:14,410
because it showed our
vast and powerful Earth

1196
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:18,890
as actually just a small, and
delicate, and finite planet.

1197
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:23,270
And this helped realize that
we really need to protect it.

1198
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:28,360
And it helped catalyze the
modern environmental movement.

1199
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,550
At the same time
in 1968, this is

1200
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:33,400
what the map of global
temperature anomalies

1201
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,550
looked like.

1202
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:38,180
And back then, our warming
was relatively moderate.

1203
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,130
But as we fast forward
to the present day,

1204
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,860
I'd like you to pay
attention to the redder

1205
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:47,070
areas, the areas of higher
temperature anomalies.

1206
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:50,290
And you can see, right at
the northern hemisphere,

1207
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:53,050
especially towards the
Arctic, it's much redder.

1208
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:56,670
And that's because the Arctic
is warming four times faster.

1209
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:01,170
And this warming has had a
significant effect on ice cover

1210
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,200
as well.

1211
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,010
This is two images,
showing simulated ice

1212
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:09,630
cover between 1984 and 2016.

1213
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:12,210
And within about
three decades, we've

1214
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:15,870
already lost about
60% of ice cover.

1215
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:19,440
And not only that, I want you to
take a look at these two images

1216
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,810
and see the shift in color.

1217
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:24,630
On the left side, it's much
wider, but on the right side,

1218
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:25,900
it's actually quite darker.

1219
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,665
And if you've been outside in
the summer on the black asphalt,

1220
00:54:28,665 --> 00:54:32,340
you know that dark
surfaces absorb heat.

1221
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,440
And so what's happening now
is, as the surfaces get darker,

1222
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,260
they're absorbing
more heat, which

1223
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,690
means that there's is more
ice melting, which means

1224
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,470
that there's darker surfaces.

1225
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:44,250
And this self-destructive
cycle is something

1226
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:47,160
called arctic amplification.

1227
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,860
And this accelerated
warming means

1228
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:55,210
that we might have an ice-free
summer as soon as 2035.

1229
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,420
And this could have
global consequences,

1230
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:02,580
like sea-level rise and
extreme weather conditions.

1231
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,380
So what can we do?

1232
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,660
Well, already by
attending this, you're

1233
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,940
being a more educated citizen,
a more educated voter,

1234
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,580
leading to better
sustainability policies.

1235
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,800
And that has curbed
our emissions.

1236
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,840
However, in terms of the
Arctic, emissions reductions

1237
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,260
might not be enough.

1238
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,020
And carbon capture
and storage, these

1239
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,312
are very important things
for the fight against climate

1240
00:55:24,312 --> 00:55:27,060
change, but unfortunately,
these technologies are still not

1241
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,720
scaling fast enough.

1242
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:32,700
So this is when we ask ourselves
an unconventional question--

1243
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:37,260
what if we could reflect
sunlight back into to space,

1244
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,330
as a temporary measure
to help cool the Arctic,

1245
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:43,140
while solutions like
decarbonization and carbon

1246
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,510
capture ramp up?

1247
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:50,550
And this idea is called
Solar Radiation Management.

1248
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:54,340
This umbrella term includes
several different techniques,

1249
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:57,390
from injecting aerosols
into the stratosphere

1250
00:55:57,390 --> 00:55:59,860
to mimic the cooling
effect of volcanoes,

1251
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:03,030
to even wackier ideas
like giant space mirrors.

1252
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,690
But for the purposes
of this talk,

1253
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:06,970
I'm going to concentrate
on this one right here,

1254
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:11,700
which is based off of my PhD,
called Marine Cloud Brightening.

1255
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,280
Now, marine cloud brightening,
the idea behind that

1256
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,720
is, what if we could increase
the albedo or the reflectivity

1257
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,930
of clouds?

1258
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:22,200
And this could potentially
reflect sunlight back

1259
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,398
into space as a
regional cooling.

1260
00:56:25,398 --> 00:56:26,440
Well, how does that work?

1261
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,180
Well, so here, we
have a white cloud.

1262
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,930
It reflects sunlight.

1263
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,720
In contrast, a darker cloud
reflects less sunlight.

1264
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,220
And the difference
between these two

1265
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,620
is just the droplet size
within those clouds.

1266
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:43,800
A white cloud is comprised
of smaller droplets,

1267
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,510
whereas a rainy
cloud, the dark cloud

1268
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:49,890
is comprised of large droplets.

1269
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:52,880
And each of these droplets,
they grow on a seed.

1270
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,213
And that seed is called a
cloud condensation nucleus.

1271
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,880
The idea behind marine
cloud brightening

1272
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,490
is-- what if we
could add more seeds

1273
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:06,270
into existing clouds in the
form of sea salt crystals?

1274
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,090
And we could do that
with a little ship

1275
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:11,010
that sprays droplets
into an existing cloud?

1276
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:14,180
And the idea is that
potentially, this

1277
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,650
could brighten or
whiten the cloud,

1278
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:21,150
increasing the solar
radiation reflection,

1279
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:23,990
thus calling a local cooling.

1280
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:26,660
And interestingly enough,
we've actually accidentally

1281
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,990
been doing this already.

1282
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,740
This is a photo of the
North Atlantic trade

1283
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,160
routes for cargo ships.

1284
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,070
And these white streaks
here that you see

1285
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:37,790
are clouds that were formed
on tiny sulfur particles

1286
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:40,730
in the exhaust of cargo ships.

1287
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:45,780
So it had a cooling effect while
also increasing air pollution,

1288
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,150
not great.

1289
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:51,140
But the idea is, what if we
could do this deliberately

1290
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:55,356
without the use of pollutants?

1291
00:57:55,356 --> 00:57:58,040

1292
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:01,680
And this is where
the science comes in.

1293
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,760
So our research has
seen that we need

1294
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,500
the following
technology requirements,

1295
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,920
specifically, the first two.

1296
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,590
We need tiny, tiny particles,
30 to 500 nanometers in size.

1297
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,730
And we need a lot of them,
10 to the 15 to 10 to the 17

1298
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:19,370
of these particles per second.

1299
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,140
Also, for scaling,
we need to make sure

1300
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,438
that it doesn't actually
take too much power.

1301
00:58:23,438 --> 00:58:25,730
It needs to be robust against
environmental conditions,

1302
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:28,620
because seawater is actually
quite corrosive to work with.

1303
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:32,060
And also, it needs to be
scalable for potential

1304
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:35,890
continental sized deployment.

1305
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:38,470
So on the right
here, there's a photo

1306
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:44,080
of these droplet cannons by
our collaborators in Australia

1307
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,160
at Southern Cross University.

1308
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,010
However, the size of droplets
that they're generating

1309
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:51,010
and the rate at which
they're generating them at

1310
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:52,250
is still too low.

1311
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:54,910
And that's why we
need innovation.

1312
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,950
And this is where I come in.

1313
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:00,490
When I started my PhD, I
remembered what my dad actually

1314
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:03,500
taught me, which was that, when
you come towards a problem,

1315
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,745
you want to see how
nature did it first.

1316
00:59:05,745 --> 00:59:10,390
And nature makes sea spray as
it's the most abundant aerosol

1317
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:13,360
produced in the world.

1318
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,420
And the way it works
is that, as waves

1319
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,470
crash over the
surface of the ocean,

1320
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:21,180
it traps air, forming bubbles.

1321
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:22,930
These bubbles then
burst, and they release

1322
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:25,520
a wide spray of tiny droplets.

1323
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,845
Now, these droplets
then, some large ones

1324
00:59:27,845 --> 00:59:30,220
will fall back to the surface,
but some of the other ones

1325
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:35,410
will waft up into the
cloud layer to form clouds.

1326
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:37,010
But how can we do
this deliberately?

1327
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,700
How can we control this process?

1328
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,850
So this is a video of
my experimental setup

1329
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:44,690
at the University of Cambridge.

1330
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:49,390
And what I'm able to do is use
a small rubber tubing that I

1331
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:50,600
poked a bunch of holes in.

1332
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,720
And I pass a low
compressed air through it.

1333
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,690
And you can see in
this bottom left corner

1334
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:57,200
that it's making
a lot of bubbles.

1335
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,742
And these bubbles
are being generated

1336
00:59:58,742 --> 01:00:00,760
and burst right at the surface.

1337
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:06,580
And this process creates a
really fine mist of droplets.

1338
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,860
And my preliminary
research has seen that,

1339
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:12,500
when testing with 3 and 1/2%
salinity or salty water,

1340
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:15,500
which is roughly, the
salinity of the ocean,

1341
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,620
I'm able to generate 10 to
the 10 particles per second,

1342
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:23,770
of which, 70% of them are within
the MCB range that I described

1343
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:24,530
previously.

1344
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:27,140
So it's really exciting.

1345
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,660
The one thing that
I need to work on

1346
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,830
is improving the energy
efficiency of this.

1347
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:34,570

1348
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:37,390
An exciting way to do that
is actually integrating it

1349
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:41,708
into an existing system called
a bubble drag reduction system.

1350
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:43,750
And that's actually being
researched here at MIT,

1351
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:46,150
where if you can inject
a layer of bubbles

1352
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:48,410
right underneath
the helm of a ship,

1353
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:51,460
you can actually reduce the
drag and reduce the fuel

1354
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,420
costs for a cargo ship.

1355
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,720
And this could
potentially then leave

1356
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:59,450
a raft of bubbles that could
burst to brighten clouds,

1357
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:02,770
or just leave it there as a
white reflective streak when

1358
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:04,125
there aren't clouds to brighten.

1359
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:06,640

1360
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,680
Now, to end my talk,
I'd like to first remind

1361
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,790
people that to be
absolutely clear,

1362
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:17,590
marine cloud brightening is
not a cure to climate change.

1363
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,360
It's not a replacement
for cutting

1364
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:24,980
emissions, or decarbonization,
or ramping up clean energy.

1365
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:28,190
But what it might be able
to do is buy us time,

1366
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:33,870
time to scale these solutions
and slow down arctic sea level

1367
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:34,370
loss.

1368
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:38,460

1369
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:42,060
And this is a very small part
of the larger climate action

1370
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,380
picture.

1371
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,220
It's controversial.

1372
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,640
It's not perfect, but
it's a conversation

1373
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,340
that we need to have
responsibly, ethically,

1374
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,550
and inclusively.

1375
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,520
And that's where
you all come in,

1376
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,670
not just as future scientists,
but as educators and activists,

1377
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:01,710
policymakers, engineers,
and informed citizens,

1378
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:04,690
because climate action
isn't just about technology,

1379
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:06,540
it's about collaboration
and community.

1380
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,790
So I also want to take this
moment to congratulate all

1381
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:13,440
of you for whether this is your
first step or your 100th step

1382
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,050
in the climate space,
for attending this event

1383
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:19,060
and choosing to care,
and to learn, and to act.

1384
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:24,480
So as we close, I ask you
today to just carry these ideas

1385
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,860
forward with a creativity,
and integrity, and hope.

1386
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,530
And maybe, we'll be able
to brighten some clouds.

1387
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:32,260
But more importantly,
I hope that we can

1388
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,270
brighten the future together.

1389
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:35,210
Thank you.

1390
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:38,626
[APPLAUSE]

1391
01:02:38,626 --> 01:02:51,820

1392
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,160
ANNOUNCER: Please
welcome Jaylen Brown

1393
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,220
of the Boston Celtics and
Media Lab Director's fellow.

1394
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:01,384
[APPLAUSE]

1395
01:03:01,384 --> 01:03:02,240

1396
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,240
JAYLEN BROWN: This work?

1397
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:07,900

1398
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:08,840
Does this work?

1399
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,420
Can you hear me?

1400
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:12,133
Good evening, everyone.

1401
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:14,050
Today, we're here to
talk about something that

1402
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:17,500
affects us all, climate change.

1403
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,410
Today marks a very
pivotal moment in time.

1404
01:03:20,410 --> 01:03:22,420
The decisions that we
make now have an impact

1405
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:25,280
on future generations.

1406
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,930
Climate change isn't just
an environmentalism issue,

1407
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:31,650
it's a social justice issue,
it's an economic issue,

1408
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:34,580
and it's also a
moral imperative.

1409
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:39,050
As someone who prides himself
on influence and responsibility,

1410
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:41,810
what an honor it is to be
here to talk about this topic.

1411
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:44,676
MIT, thank you for having me.

1412
01:03:44,676 --> 01:03:48,162
[APPLAUSE]

1413
01:03:48,162 --> 01:03:50,525

1414
01:03:50,525 --> 01:03:53,150
Today, we're going to talk about
the crossover and intersection

1415
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:56,780
between environmentalism,
social justice, and education,

1416
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:00,290
in combination with raising
awareness, leveraging

1417
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:03,020
your platform and influence,
and investing in the sustainable

1418
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:04,850
future.

1419
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:06,300
But let me be clear.

1420
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,943
I think we're in a
little bit of a crisis.

1421
01:04:08,943 --> 01:04:13,418

1422
01:04:13,418 --> 01:04:16,710
This isn't just fiction,
this is reality.

1423
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:18,260
This isn't TikTok.

1424
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:21,740
And some of these things
are happening on our watch.

1425
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:26,810
I was taught that the justice
of all human well-being

1426
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:28,610
is all encompassing.

1427
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:31,280
My grandmother taught me
the importance of education.

1428
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,360
She also taught me the
importance of recycling.

1429
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,430
She would get upset
if I threw my water

1430
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:38,700
bottles in the wrong trash.

1431
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:43,190
And she also made me pick up
trash on our walks to the park.

1432
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:46,280
As a seven-year-old,
I would question her,

1433
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,310
but this had an
impact on my journey.

1434
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:52,430
She also had a garden,
where metaphorically, I

1435
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,890
learned to plant seeds
and nourish the soil.

1436
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:58,400
This also had an impact
on my journey, which

1437
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,250
led me to communities and
organizations such as habitat

1438
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:03,920
for humanity, where I
was joined by a bunch

1439
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,420
of other young
people, just like you

1440
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:08,780
all, who had a passion
for climate change.

1441
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:13,460
And now, I'm here at the
Day of Climate event at MIT,

1442
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,900
speaking about the effects
of environmentalism.

1443
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,055
And I hope, I'm making
my grandmother proud.

1444
01:05:18,055 --> 01:05:20,810

1445
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:22,085
Thank you.

1446
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:22,710
I'm all for it.

1447
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:26,021
[APPLAUSE]

1448
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:27,440

1449
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,110
One of the more concerning
effects of climate change

1450
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:31,880
is the weather patterns--

1451
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,850
floods, droughts, heat waves are
all examples of these events.

1452
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:40,380
These events put pressure on the
infrastructure of our community,

1453
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:41,910
the infrastructure
of our society,

1454
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:45,870
the infrastructure of our
economic and health systems.

1455
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:49,070
And they make vulnerable
populations a little bit more

1456
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,680
vulnerable, who necessarily
don't have the chance

1457
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,110
to defend themselves.

1458
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:55,410
This is inequity.

1459
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,830
This is a call to action for
all of us and a major concern.

1460
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:02,060
I believe that
environmentalism and climate

1461
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:06,030
change isn't just something
that we should think about.

1462
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:09,590
It's also an evolution
of our thought process,

1463
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:14,370
from serving our ecosystems
to helping our ecosystems,

1464
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:19,280
from the understanding of
footprint to the embracing

1465
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:23,710
of your soul print, the
concerns, the consequences

1466
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:25,870
of greed and capitalism.

1467
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:29,350
From the products
we use to the rivers

1468
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:33,340
we poison, my
question is, globally,

1469
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:39,400
is it clean energy if we
leave dirty footprints?

1470
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,730
Education and awareness is key.

1471
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:46,720
A lot of people have a hard time
seeing that climate change is

1472
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,050
affecting our day to day lives.

1473
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:49,700
They see it as
something distant.

1474
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,340
But the reality is that climate
change is already here--

1475
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:56,360
our air, our oceans, our forests
are already being compromised.

1476
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,340
These aren't just
social media events.

1477
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:03,070
We've already seen the fires
in California to the Hurricanes

1478
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:05,830
in the Caribbean.

1479
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:09,880
Education and
preparation is key.

1480
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:13,930
The disruption of ecosystems
and environments are imminent.

1481
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:19,270
And as a society,
because of the awareness,

1482
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:22,240
I believe that we
are ill-prepared.

1483
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,910
But I'm optimistic,
because education

1484
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:28,970
has the power to transform
societies, it always has.

1485
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:31,120
It's no coincidence
that the solutions

1486
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,400
to environmental
problems and challenges

1487
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,450
come from places like this.

1488
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:40,420
And young people and young
minds like you all here today.

1489
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:43,810
This year, I had the pleasure of
meeting one of my heroes, Bill

1490
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:44,700
Nye, the Science Guy.

1491
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,370
[LAUGHTER]

1492
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:48,105
[APPLAUSE]

1493
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:48,855
Shout out to Bill.

1494
01:07:48,855 --> 01:07:51,490

1495
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:56,840
Bill made science accessible and
exciting through his platform.

1496
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,740
Through my platform,
I aim to do the same.

1497
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:02,230
He inspired a generation
to care about science,

1498
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:06,320
and environmentalism,
and physics,

1499
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,640
all while indulging
in dad jokes.

1500
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,020
[LAUGHTER]

1501
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:13,330
I think this generation
needs more of that-- more

1502
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:18,750
learning, more inspiration,
more action, more desire, more

1503
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:21,120
solution-based thinking.

1504
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,279
As an athlete, I've
been able to travel all

1505
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:26,050
over the world, meeting
people of all walks of life,

1506
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:28,560
experiencing the
beauty of our planet.

1507
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,765
And I've already seen,
through my travels,

1508
01:08:33,765 --> 01:08:37,229
the evidence that our
changing world is here.

1509
01:08:37,229 --> 01:08:39,670
The science is real--
human activity,

1510
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:43,779
the burning of fossil
fuels, deforestation,

1511
01:08:43,779 --> 01:08:47,590
the greenhouse gases that
affect our atmosphere,

1512
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:50,430
leading to a warmer planet.

1513
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:51,769
Has anybody ever had a fever?

1514
01:08:51,769 --> 01:08:54,330

1515
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:56,050
What happens when
you have a fever?

1516
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:59,370
The body heats up.

1517
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:00,790
What does that tell you?

1518
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:04,660
What does that mean
when the body heats up?

1519
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:05,970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1520
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:08,279
JAYLEN BROWN: It's
trying to heal.

1521
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:11,340
Now, Earth is heating up.

1522
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,710
It releases water.

1523
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:19,319
It receives storms, floods,
rising tides, unseasonal rains,

1524
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:21,040
all examples of the
Earth responding,

1525
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:23,920
trying to cool itself
down, attempting to heal,

1526
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,529
no different.

1527
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:27,910
I take responsibility
on the court.

1528
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:29,970
I believe, we all should
take responsibility

1529
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:33,399
of our environment, through
strategy, through teamwork,

1530
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:34,660
through sacrifice.

1531
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,279
I think this is essential.

1532
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:38,779
I want everybody
to close your eyes.

1533
01:09:38,779 --> 01:09:41,399

1534
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:46,770
Imagine that we're all on
the same team, same arena,

1535
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:52,500
same jerseys, and the
game is on the line.

1536
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,770
Now, think about this.

1537
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,860
We're not just
playing for ourselves,

1538
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:59,490
we're playing for
the next generation.

1539
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:01,620
Open your eyes.

1540
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:04,385
Who is willing to do
what it takes to win?

1541
01:10:04,385 --> 01:10:09,000

1542
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,430
To invest is not just monetary.

1543
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:16,830
Investing is time, effort,
energy, and resources.

1544
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:19,000
We need to invest in
sustainable communities.

1545
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,980
We need to invest
in clean technology.

1546
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:24,270
We also need to invest
in education that fosters

1547
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:27,730
environmental stewardship.

1548
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:29,670
To invest in our
environment is an investment

1549
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:34,920
in us, to young people, to young
minds who may be listening.

1550
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,170
When you dream about
your future, dream

1551
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:41,730
about a future that brings
harmony and balance with Earth,

1552
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:47,040
to the jobs you choose, to the
foods you eat, to the energy

1553
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,570
you invest.

1554
01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:51,690
Think about how you can
bring harmony to our planet

1555
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:54,750
rather than taking or
extracting from it.

1556
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,200
Our Earth is at risk.

1557
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,560
She is slowly being
taken advantage of.

1558
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,580
And the people
responsible have names,

1559
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:03,900
have companies, have
incentives, have egos.

1560
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,645
This is the city of champions.

1561
01:11:06,645 --> 01:11:07,145
Right?

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

[APPLAUSE]

1564
01:11:12,327 --> 01:11:13,910
JAYLEN BROWN: So I
think we should all

1565
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:16,430
take responsibility and
carry a championship

1566
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:19,100
mindset in our environment.

1567
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,510
It starts with us.

1568
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:24,260
And we can start a global
movement in the future.

1569
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:28,970
Nicholas Negroponte, a
name that some of you guys

1570
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:32,960
will be familiar with here at
MIT, his vision with the MIT

1571
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,370
Media Lab was to create
an environment, where

1572
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:41,780
a bunch of collective minds
and subjects can work together.

1573
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:44,010
Change doesn't
come from one plan,

1574
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:45,900
one person, one initiative.

1575
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:50,720
It comes from a host of people,
all working together in unison.

1576
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:54,260
So when I look into the crowd,
that's what I see here today.

1577
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:57,200
If you haven't gotten
involved in your community

1578
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:02,330
and your environment,
this speech is your cue.

1579
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:06,060
I want to see a movement
for climate action.

1580
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:08,270
It's not about just
us, it's about securing

1581
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:12,920
a safe and livable future
for the next generation.

1582
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,023
We have the power.

1583
01:12:14,023 --> 01:12:14,940
We have the resources.

1584
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:16,310
We have the intelligence.

1585
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:18,330
Do we have the willpower?

1586
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:19,680
Do we have the desire?

1587
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,120
Do we have the
foresight in order

1588
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:29,600
to secure a livable future
for the next generation?

1589
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,980
In closing, the fight
for climate change

1590
01:12:33,980 --> 01:12:36,530
is a response for justice.

1591
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:40,110
It is a urgency for
the next generation.

1592
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:41,780
It is a preparation
for communities

1593
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:43,170
who are ill-prepared.

1594
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:46,430
And it is an insistence
for us and our values

1595
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:49,190
that we hold as human beings.

1596
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:52,920
Let's stand together,
united in our purpose,

1597
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,100
with unwavering commitment.

1598
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,670
The time to act is now.

1599
01:12:56,670 --> 01:12:57,220

01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:33,610
What an amazing event.

I am Cynthia Breazeal.

1610
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:39,350
I am the final speaker in
this part of the program.

1611
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:43,270
And it is my privilege and my
honor to help bring us together

1612
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:46,870
as a community to really
express our gratitude

1613
01:13:46,870 --> 01:13:50,620
and appreciation for everyone
who was involved in making

through your participation,

1615

and all the people who do
the work behind the scenes

1616

climate program possible.

1617
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:59,770
So whereas everybody,
you've been

1618
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:02,770
such an awesome, quiet,
attentive audience,

1619
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:06,506
in my remarks, I want you
to make a lot of noise.

All right.

1623
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:18,400
So, I mean, first,
we really have

1624
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:23,500
to give Claudia Urrea, the
pK-12 team, and Open Learning

1625

a huge round of applause for
the tremendous amount of work

1626
01:14:31,030 --> 01:14:32,500
that they've done.

1627
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,160
And our faculty advisors--

1628
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,490
Eric Klopfer, Peter
Senge, and Pawan Sinha

1629
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:39,700
for their advice and
guidance through the creation

1630
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:42,760
and the execution
of this program.

1631
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:47,240
I want to thank the Climate
Action Through Education,

1632
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,810
the CATE team, and
the Boston Earth Day

1633

deep, warm appreciation

1645

for the generous support from
Dirk and Charlene Kabcenell

1646

01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:25,980
All right.

1649
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:29,200
So some of you may know,
some of you may not know,

1650
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:35,050
but MIT is actually quite
passionate about K-12 education.

1651
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:38,920
So when we have this concept
of the Day of Climate Program,

1652
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:41,430
we wanted to get
curriculum, as we've

1653
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:43,870
said from Chris
Knittel, world class,

1654
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:45,880
innovative, free curriculum.

1655
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:50,800
We ran what's called an RFP or
Request For Proposal process.

1656
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,250
We basically sent out to the
whole MIT community, saying,

1657
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:57,870
hey, we want to start to
create terrific curriculum

1658
01:15:57,870 --> 01:16:00,120
that teachers can teach
in K-12 classrooms,

1659
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,580
to students from elementary to
middle school or high school.

1660
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:06,340
Would you like to
contribute materials?

1661
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:10,680
And MIT answered the
call across all of MIT.

1662
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:15,390
And so I just want to give you
a sense of just the breadth

1663
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:19,770
and the range of curriculum
that MIT did just this year

1664
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:20,570
for this program.

1665
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:21,070
OK.

1666
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:24,720
So just to put this
into perspective.

1667
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,940
CATE contributed
curriculum on topics

1668
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:29,100
such as industrial
revolution and climate

1669
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:32,370
change for middle school,
climate and renewable

1670
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:35,500
energy, and the impact of
population growth on climate,

1671
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,160
the MIT App Inventor team
contributed curriculum

1672
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:42,960
for elementary school students,
and upwards on water ecosystems

1673
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,440
and climate change.

1674
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:46,183
The MIT Edgerton
Center contributed

1675
01:16:46,183 --> 01:16:47,850
to curriculum for
middle school students

1676
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:49,750
on coastal climate science.

1677
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:52,140
The School of Architecture
contributed curriculum

1678
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,750
on the impact of construction
on carbon emissions

1679
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:57,340
and climate-resilient
future buildings.

1680
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:59,670
The MIT Environmental
Solutions Initiative

1681
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:03,040
developed a curriculum on urban
heat islands, climate justice,

1682
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,650
geothermal energy networks,
and curriculum for high school.

1683
01:17:06,650 --> 01:17:08,590
The day of AI
contributed curriculum

1684
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:10,610
on data science AI and climate.

1685
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:13,840
And our Cambridge Public School
collaborators and the PLIX team

1686
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,000
contributed curriculum
on cube satellites

1687
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,978
for exploring outer space
environment and urban ecology

1688
01:17:18,978 --> 01:17:20,270
for elementary students and up.

1689
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:22,970
So just an amazing
range of curriculum.

1690
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,595
So again, let's put
our hands together.

1692
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:29,810
In one year, and we're
just getting started,

1693
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:33,790
world class, free,
innovative curriculum.

1694
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:37,250
So we had an amazing
lineup of speakers.

So thank you for all the
students and teachers

1715
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,470
who are here,
presenting their work,

1716
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:30,270
their ideas, their passion.

1717
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:31,950
Really phenomenal.

1718
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:34,250
Really, really phenomenal.

1719
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:38,240
You're really showing us how you
can make such a big difference

1720
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,580
from these high-quality
educational content,

1721
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:44,990
combined with the passion of
K-12 educators and our students.

1722
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:47,570
And it's just been truly
inspiring to witness

1723
01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:51,980
how our whole community came
together today and demonstrated

1724
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:54,680
the power of
collaboration and advocacy

1725
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,600
in driving meaningful change.

1726
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:01,280
So as we conclude, let's just
remember the significance

1727
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,620
of empowering K-12
learners and educators,

1728
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:06,420
with the tools and knowledge
to tackle climate change,

1729
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:09,020
the connections and insights
gained here today are really

1730
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:10,310
just the beginning.

1731
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:12,675
We encourage everyone to
continue their efforts

1732
01:19:12,675 --> 01:19:15,050
in their communities, leveraging
what we've learned today

1733
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,590
to make a positive impact.

1734
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:20,450
So please stay engaged
with Day of Climate at MIT.

1735
01:19:20,450 --> 01:19:22,370
And explore further
opportunities

1736
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:24,120
for collaboration and learning.

1737
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,810
And together, we really
have the collective power

1738
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:29,520
to create a sustainable
and resilient future.

1739
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,730
So thank you so much.

1740
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:34,080
[APPLAUSE]

1741
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,530

1742
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:41,210
So the Day of Climate at MIT
was put forth by the larger MIT

1743
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,270
pK-12 initiative.

1744
01:19:42,270 --> 01:19:43,830
It's a brand new
initiative at MIT.

1745
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:45,247
I think you're
going to be hearing

1746
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:48,620
a lot of exciting work
being done by this group.

1747
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:52,873
And we're going to have some
really exciting workshops next.

1748
01:19:52,873 --> 01:19:55,040
So I'll invite Claudia to
tell you a little bit more

1749
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,070
about them.

1750
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:57,175
Again, Thank you all.

1751
01:19:57,175 --> 01:20:00,290
[APPLAUSE]

1752
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:01,248
CLAUDIA URREA: Awesome.

1753
01:20:01,248 --> 01:20:02,660
Thank you so much, Cynthia.

1754
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:05,660
I want to invite the
speakers also to the front.

1755
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:07,190
We have a little gift for you.

1756
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:10,750
But we have three workshops that
are going to happen from 6:30

1757
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:11,630
to 7:00.

1758
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:15,700
We also have appetizers,
and drinks, and social.

1759
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,750
So I welcome you to that.

1760
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:20,270
We have inroads in this space.

1761
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:26,360
We have map works IN one of
the workshops in the beginning.

1762
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:30,610
And then we do have a
climate change in solar,

1763
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:32,660
no, IN wind turbines, right?

1764
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:33,555
So wind turbines.

1765
01:20:33,555 --> 01:20:34,930
So one of the
educators from CATE

1766
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:37,310
is going to run, also,
a workshop for us.

1767
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:39,160
So don't miss the
opportunity to work

1768
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,980
with those educators
in this 30 minutes,

1769
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:45,270
and continue this
excitement work.

1770
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:47,620
[APPLAUSE]

1771
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:49,170
Speakers.

1772
01:20:49,170 --> 01:21:00,000
