1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,400
Welcome to everyone. I'm uh super

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,919
excited to get this started and look

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,000
forward to two really uh great days of

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,080
amazing science and stimulating

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,240
discussions. I still can't imagine a

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,119
better time to be in science. The drive

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,039
particularly in AI and biio medicine is

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,480
going to be too strong. It's going to

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,760
move at an amazing pace, you know,

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:30,039
faster I believe than advances in in in

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,039
the genome um took place.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,079
Being here is just a dream come true for

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,960
me cuz I come from a pure computational

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,559
background. So I saw a lot of legendary

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,879
names that I only read on the

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,160
manuscripts as the principal

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,680
investigator in real life. So the

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,920
tremendous surprise and honor to be here

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,960
and it is really really inspiring

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,400
conference symposium overall a ton of

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,240
discussion that's just really

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,479
stimulating and inspiring.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,880
>> I thought it was very interesting seeing

24
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,479
the scope of problems that people are

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,400
thinking about how to learn from like

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,640
hundreds of thousands of images or like

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,119
thousands of like spatial transcrytoics

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,960
or single cell data sets. It was very

29
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,040
inspiring to hear how big people are

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,720
thinking about big problems and like the

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,799
solutions to those problems. And one

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,400
more good thing about this conference

33
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,400
was usually you go to academic

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,840
conferences you may find some academic

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,680
top people but this here I also saw many

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,560
people from industry who are working on

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,159
academic but kind of uh somehow making

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,960
sure that industry and academia are on

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,880
the same page and

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,560
>> I think the poster sessions and like the

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,399
short talks for younger junior

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,560
researchers are really helpful for kind

43
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,240
of like showing our work to like this

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,040
broad field including like people from

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,159
industry and academia. I believe like AI

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,600
is is addressed in many contextes

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:03,040
today's but we still have a gap when it

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,119
comes to applying AI in the biology and

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,040
we we could see that many talks address

50
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,319
this topic and into different

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,959
applications the way AI we reshape how

52
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,040
we believe and how we conceive science

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,480
is going to be massive in the next years

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,720
>> it's on the intersection of machine

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,120
learning and bio which is like right

56
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,560
where I'm at home and I'm enjoying that

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,040
So many people with different

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,480
perspectives come together and have

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,959
different ways of thinking about

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,520
problems. So usually it kind of inspires

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,400
me.

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,560
>> I think the best part was also be having

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,720
the hallway conversations being the at

64
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,640
the poster sessions talking to people

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,040
about science that you're doing yourself

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,519
and getting inspired by many new ideas

67
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,760
seeing how people are really engaged in

68
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,599
that field and just being very excited

69
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,760
about what the future for this field

70
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,920
holds. It's really cool seeing the just

71
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,440
different diversity of topics that all

72
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,040
these different researchers are talking

73
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,680
about and it's really giving this sense

74
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,040
that biology is reaching this like stage

75
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,120
where we can start to think about how

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,720
these different scales start to interact

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,640
with each other when different data

78
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,159
modalities like in the morning we saw

79
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,280
people talking about images and then

80
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,640
later we saw people talking about

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,319
tissues but there's a lot of shared

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,800
themes that I think are really

83
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,720
interesting.

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,040
>> Dr. Emma Lombberg's talk is like already

85
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,360
like very illuminating and also like all

86
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,720
the talks like from like Ellen Institute

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,400
like with all these like amazing

88
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,640
institutions like doing all the cutting

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,800
edge research even though I'm reading

90
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,640
literature like this occasion really

91
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,720
brings me a lot of different perspective

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,159
to really illuminate my research

93
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,640
general. I think this is really great

94
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,720
and I have a lot of fun like just

95
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,400
attending it especially in person and

96
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,760
like communicating with all these

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,360
different experts.

98
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,319
>> It's great to follow up on past

99
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,560
collaborations. um but also think about

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,799
um what I could start in the future get

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,879
some inspiration on the interface here

102
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,159
from sology to machine learning and how

103
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,000
other people think about it.

104
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,799
>> There are many similar project uh to

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,840
what I'm currently working on on spatial

106
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:03,040
armies data and I talked to several

107
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,760
speakers get more understanding of the

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,760
area.

109
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,159
>> I'm really looking forward to this event

110
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,840
just going on and on so we can keep

111
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,640
coming back to it. Yeah, I hope to come

112
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,640
back next year. Thanks,
