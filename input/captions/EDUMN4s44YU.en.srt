1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,080
Okay. So

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,080
last time we talked about so we had a

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,000
function

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,400
or sequence of function. We had a

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,800
interval say I and we had a sequence of

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,960
function fn and a function f all defined

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,880
on this interval.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,880
And then we uh talked about uh pointwise

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,880
convergence.

10
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:50,760
So pointwise convergence means that for

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,760
each. So this is for each

12
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,199
uh x

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,879
when you're looking at this. So this is

14
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,000
a for each x fixed this is a sequence

15
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,199
this is supposed to converge to f ofx.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,200
So this was pointwise convergence and

17
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,200
then we also talked about uniform

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,200
convergence.

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,159
And this meant that

20
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,880
this meant that for all for all epsilon

21
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,920
greater than zero there exist a capital

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,680
n such that

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,720
if

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,040
um if little n is bigger equal to this

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:40,240
capital n then the difference between fn

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,560
of x and f ofx

27
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,240
this here is smaller than epsilon and

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,000
this here have to hold for fall in 4x

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,479
sorry

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,200
right so uniform again refer to that is

31
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,600
uniform in x the convergence is uniform

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,200
in x

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,240
then so we talked about that and then

34
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,159
one of the theorems we proved was that

35
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:11,879
if you take a sequence

36
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,879
uh fn and these here was integraable

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,319
uh And uh these converge

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,959
to some function f

39
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:29,160
uh then uh then then f is integral. So

40
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,160
this here is uniform convergence.

41
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,519
Then f here is integraable

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,519
and the integral is the limit of the

43
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:47,040
integrals. So the integral from a to b

44
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:51,120
of fn x dx

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:56,319
is equal is the limit here of this. So

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:03:00,760
the limit exist and it is equal to

47
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,760
the integral of f.

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,720
Okay.

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,280
Now so this is how uniform uh

50
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,959
convergence and

51
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,640
uh um and integrals interact.

52
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:24,200
Uh if we take the suppose you take a

53
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,200
sequence here. So this is a theorem

54
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,360
that suppose you take a sequence

55
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:35,640
uh fn

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,640
of functions on some interval into r.

57
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:45,280
you have uh x0

58
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,280
is uh is in this interval.

59
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,920
And then you have the following if you

60
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:56,080
have the following properties

61
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:59,599
uh that one is that this sequence here

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,959
converge to some number C.

63
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:08,000
Um sorry this sequence here converts to

64
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:12,159
some number C. two is that that these

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,680
functions here fn are differentiable.

66
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,680
So, so these are maybe I should say here

67
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,680
differentiable

68
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,960
and these are converge to some function

69
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,479
g and then three is that these functions

70
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,320
here sorry the derivative converge and

71
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,759
the I'm also requiring that the

72
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,759
derivative are continuous

73
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,680
suppose we have these three

74
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,120
So we have the sequence of

75
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,800
differentiable functions. If you just

76
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,360
fix this one particular point x0 then

77
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,000
the values of these function converge

78
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,000
and then the functions their derivatives

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,560
are continuous and the derivative

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,240
converge to some function

81
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,240
and this convergence here is uniform.

82
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:14,759
Then the claim is that then

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,759
uh um then there exist

84
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:27,280
uh f on the interval

85
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,039
so that uh f is uh

86
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,080
f

87
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,080
uh is differentiable.

88
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,080
The derivative here is continuous

89
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,560
and uh and you have the following two

90
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,160
properties

91
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:58,199
that the function here these functions

92
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,199
converge to f uh uniformly.

93
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm going to restrict my interval.

94
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,600
I'm going to take it just to be some

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,280
interval from A to B. So,

96
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,520
and this here is a interval. I want it

97
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,520
to be bounded

98
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,039
like that.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,440
And uh so these here converge uniformly

100
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,360
and true is

101
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,759
that uh their derivative

102
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,759
converts to the derivative of f

103
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,759
uniformly.

104
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Okay.

105
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,759
So we want to prove that

106
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,840
and then so

107
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:53,520
so we're going to define a function f.

108
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:57,199
So G here is a proof of this.

109
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,840
Since this sequence here since these

110
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,840
here are continuous

111
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,720
uh and um

112
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,720
and these functions here converts to G

113
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,720
uniformly.

114
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,919
Then this means that uh

115
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,680
uh then

116
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,199
uh uh therefore

117
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,960
therefore

118
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,960
g here is also continuous

119
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,639
right. So we proved this already that if

120
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,120
you have a sequence of continuous

121
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:47,360
function that converges uniformly then

122
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:50,240
the limit is also continuous.

123
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,800
And so then we can look at so we can

124
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,599
define

125
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,599
we can therefore define

126
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:07,800
define

127
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,800
uh f as a function on this interval here

128
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:18,560
by

129
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:23,120
that's the uh that's um f of X is equal

130
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:26,800
to the integral from X0

131
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,560
uh so I'm defining it sorry to be um

132
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:38,080
this C constant C plus the integral from

133
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:40,800
X0 to X of G of X G of uh S

134
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,640
DS

135
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,519
right so I define this function like

136
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,839
this G is continuous

137
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,920
so this is a nice continuous function

138
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,160
and in fact by the fundamental theorem

139
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,160
of calculus

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,800
uh theorem of calculus

141
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,080
uh f here is differentiable

142
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,800
uh with

143
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,640
with the derivative

144
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:27,279
equal to G. Right?

145
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:31,399
We also have that um

146
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,399
that we also have

147
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,880
that uh if we're looking at f of x0 fn

148
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,480
of x0

149
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,040
right

150
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,640
then we know already that these convert

151
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:57,760
to c. This is the assumption one up

152
00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:02,440
there. But this here is the value of f

153
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,440
at x0. So we have that.

154
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,760
I want to now prove that that not just

155
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:14,320
at this point but that this sequence

156
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:19,279
converts to f uniformly. Right? B here B

157
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:22,279
we get for free. Right? So b

158
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,279
follows

159
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,279
from

160
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:33,760
that this fn prime converts to g. Right?

161
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,360
And this here is this here is the

162
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,360
derivative of f and we have this

163
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,360
uniformly

164
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,680
by by assumption two. Right?

165
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,000
So all we need to show is So we just

166
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,000
need to show

167
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,519
that this fn converts to f uniform.

168
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,079
Right? We just need to show the a the

169
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:14,160
property a. Right?

170
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:17,519
And so we're looking at uh fn

171
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,600
of x we have to look at this difference

172
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:25,279
right and for a given epsilon we have to

173
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,440
find a little n. So we have to find a

174
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,920
capital n. So that if little n is bigger

175
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,120
than this capital n then this difference

176
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,680
here is smaller than epsilon for all x.

177
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,000
Right? But let's try to estimate this

178
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,079
here first. Right?

179
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,160
So this difference here is um

180
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,800
this difference is f

181
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,760
uh by so we can write so so we want to

182
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,760
estimate this difference and I can and

183
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,240
we can use the fundamental theorem of

184
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,519
calculus. I use

185
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,519
the fundamentality of calc

186
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,600
of calc

187
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,399
to write

188
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:24,079
uh fn

189
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:29,360
of x. We can write this as the value at

190
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:33,000
x0 plus the integral of the derivative

191
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,000
from this point

192
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,440
and then this should be s like this.

193
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,360
Right? We can use the fundamental the

194
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:47,360
calculus to just rewrite

195
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,880
fn like that. And so now I want to look

196
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:55,040
at this difference here.

197
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:59,880
And so to look at this difference fn of

198
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,880
x minus f ofx

199
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:09,279
now I can fill in this form of it. So I

200
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:16,959
have that this is fn of x0 plus the

201
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:19,760
integral from x0 to x fn prime sds

202
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:25,519
and then I have to subtract

203
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:31,680
uh f ofx but fx was given by by this uh

204
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:34,560
formula here and so so minus c plus this

205
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,880
integral here

206
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:42,120
uh g of s gs

207
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,120
like that

208
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,240
and so now I'm just rearranging terms so

209
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:54,000
I just think about this thing here as fn

210
00:13:48,240 --> 00:14:00,320
n of x0 minus c. I take these two first

211
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:08,199
and then plus the integral of x0 to x f

212
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:08,199
prime n s ds minus this integral here

213
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,160
like that. Right? And then I use the

214
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:21,920
triangle inequality that this thing here

215
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:25,199
is less than fn of x minus c sorry fn of

216
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,160
x0 minus c

217
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,440
absolute value like this. And then I

218
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,959
have the second integral here. So the

219
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,639
absolute value or the difference here if

220
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,560
you do it slowly like this. So you have

221
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,720
this minus

222
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:48,079
this in here

223
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:51,360
of g of s ds like that.

224
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,600
Now I can think about this thing here as

225
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,720
I can find the integral. So I can write

226
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,440
this thing here as so this I'm just

227
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,519
keeping this first term here. I'm just

228
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,720
keeping and then the second here I can

229
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,880
think about this as a integral of the

230
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,639
difference of these function and this

231
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,639
here was an was an in here

232
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:26,279
like that. Right.

233
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,279
And now

234
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,760
now I can uh

235
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,760
now I can

236
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:44,160
so now I can uh here I can just take the

237
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,040
absolute value sign.

238
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,920
If I take the value I in under it then I

239
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:55,360
get something potentially larger. Right?

240
00:15:49,920 --> 00:16:00,959
So this thing here is lesser equal to

241
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:03,680
fn of x0 minus c. That's the first term.

242
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:07,040
And now I'm replacing it by something

243
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:12,800
that is bigger equal to this. So where

244
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:18,560
I'm just integrating from x0 to x and

245
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:24,199
then of this difference here fn prime s

246
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,199
minus g of s gs

247
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:34,680
and now I'm using that uh that's the fn

248
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,680
so now using so since

249
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,480
fn

250
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,720
of y.

251
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,440
So

252
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,720
right so let me actually

253
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,800
let me just uh write this thing here. So

254
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,360
I can write this thing here. This one

255
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,279
here I'm keeping

256
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,920
this one here I'm keeping. So I'm

257
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:59,320
writing this as lesser equal to keeping

258
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,320
the first term

259
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,880
and the second term you see this thing

260
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:12,720
here is this difference between these

261
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:16,880
two. Well, the difference is at some S

262
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:19,839
is smaller than the maximum for all S,

263
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:26,559
right? But the maximum for all S, that's

264
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:29,039
what we call D F N prime G, right? That

265
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,520
was the maximum over all S. And so now

266
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,400
we just have so this this function in

267
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,400
here is less than this. And now we are

268
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,200
using this is where I want to use that

269
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,760
the interval is bounded. So I just get

270
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,440
plus b minus a. This is the length of

271
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:50,039
the interval like that. Right?

272
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,039
And so now you see that as

273
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,720
um and now there's no reference to x on

274
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,840
this side. Right? And so you see that as

275
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,799
n goes to infinity well this thing here

276
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,640
goes to zero and this thing here goes to

277
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:09,640
zero right. So as this go this upper

278
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,640
bound

279
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,320
goes to zero

280
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:24,640
and and and again note that there's no

281
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,480
reference to x. That's a reference to x0

282
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,919
but that's just some fixed points right?

283
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,919
So this is uniform in x right

284
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,320
so

285
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,320
this implies

286
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,160
uniform

287
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,679
in x convergence.

288
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,440
Okay. So I want to

289
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,760
I want to draw some uh consequences of

290
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,600
this.

291
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:04,480
First let me look at what will be

292
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:07,440
shortly a a particular case of more

293
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,840
general phenomena.

294
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,960
So this is

295
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,440
this is this example we looked at

296
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,600
several times

297
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,480
last time.

298
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,480
So but it's now applied in this case

299
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,480
here.

300
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,679
So suppose you're looking at the

301
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,720
function

302
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:40,080
uh functions e n of x. The en is where

303
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:44,480
you're summing from k = 0 to n

304
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:47,039
of x ^ k / k factorial. I looked at

305
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,240
those last time, these functions and I

306
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,080
called we called them en.

307
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,720
And then we also looked at the

308
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,720
exponential function

309
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:02,160
and the exponential function

310
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,720
in terms of power series that was just

311
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,679
this power series,

312
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:12,720
right?

313
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:18,320
And we have that uh we have that uh that

314
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:23,360
en here. So that for for all this was we

315
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:26,360
used bias stress M test to to buy bias

316
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,360
stress

317
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,320
M test

318
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,080
for all

319
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,280
L L sub positive

320
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:47,200
real number

321
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:52,600
we had that uh that we had that these

322
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,600
functions converge to e uniformly

323
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,840
on

324
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,559
an interval like this. They don't

325
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:04,159
necessarily in fact they don't but they

326
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,799
you know um they the the claim here

327
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,520
about uniform convergence is just on

328
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,760
every bounded interval right so you fix

329
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,520
a bounded interval like that interval

330
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,520
and then you have uniform convergence

331
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,039
it's not like uniform convergence of all

332
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:22,720
of R at the same time

333
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:26,640
okay you have that

334
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:30,000
and now if we are looking at

335
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:34,159
so Now um

336
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,159
if we're looking at the function

337
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,159
um

338
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,240
if we take now the derivative of the

339
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,240
ends. So what is the derivative of the

340
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,240
ens?

341
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,799
So the derivative of the en

342
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:00,799
is just a polomial. So you can just

343
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:09,840
differentiate each term on its own.

344
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:11,760
So this here is the sum here of uh of um

345
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,280
of k

346
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,960
x to the power k -1

347
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,120
/

348
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,720
k factorial.

349
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:29,679
And here you would be summing from k= to

350
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:34,240
zero to n right this is just the right

351
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:38,400
and now I can write this also

352
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,080
you see the first term because k when k

353
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,760
is equal to zero the first term doesn't

354
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,000
really count right so this thing here I

355
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,240
can write as I mean by it doesn't count

356
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,640
because it's zero right so you don't

357
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,240
really need to write that term. So you

358
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:58,480
can just write it from k = to 1 to n and

359
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:04,480
then you could write it again as k * uh

360
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:06,799
x ^ k -1 / k factorial.

361
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,200
But k factorial

362
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,360
k factorial

363
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,520
is just

364
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:20,320
is the same as k times

365
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:23,520
k minus one factorial. Right? So this

366
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,360
means that k factorial

367
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,559
over k

368
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,120
is just the same as k minus one

369
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,640
factorial.

370
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,799
Right? Or if you will, if I take the

371
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:42,320
inverse of this

372
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:46,559
k over k factorial, it's the same as 1 /

373
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,559
k minus one factorial. It's just

374
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,400
flipping the denominator and

375
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:56,400
denominator.

376
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:59,440
So this finite sum I can write as k = 1

377
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:05,320
to n because you see this thing here is

378
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,320
exactly this. So we can just replace it.

379
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,559
Can write it like that.

380
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:22,159
But now this thing here

381
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,960
I'm summing from one to n. The first

382
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,159
term I get

383
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,799
that is just this here by definition

384
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,360
when k is equal to one that's zero

385
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,960
factorial zero factorial by definition

386
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,919
is one right. So this thing here and

387
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,640
this thing here by definition is is also

388
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:46,159
one. So this here is just one. So

389
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,679
starting off at one when k is equal to

390
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:52,960
two then this become x this become one

391
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,600
factorial one factorial is just one so

392
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,440
this here is x right so the this here is

393
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:04,159
like this x the next one when k is equal

394
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,559
to three then you get x squ

395
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,039
sorry you get x squ and down here you

396
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,919
get two factorial

397
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:17,520
right and so you continue like this and

398
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:22,559
The last one you get is x ^ n -1 over n

399
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:25,760
minus one factorial right and so yeah

400
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:30,400
let let me just say uh so so you see

401
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:33,520
that this thing here is nothing but e n

402
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,919
minus one of x

403
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:41,760
right

404
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:46,799
so the derivative of of the e n is the

405
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:49,799
previous element en minus one. Yep.

406
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,799
>> Okay.

407
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:58,360
Okay. So now we have

408
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,760
we have that uh

409
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,279
we have that uh

410
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,679
like we have that dish in

411
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:17,600
If I'm

412
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:21,679
looking at the en is zero

413
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:24,240
those the value here of these guys

414
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,200
the only term that matters is the first

415
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:31,320
term and that's one.

416
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,320
So this here for each end.

417
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,919
So now what you have is so now we have

418
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,440
that you have that if you're looking at

419
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:51,600
this sequence you have we have this we

420
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:55,760
have that the e n prime

421
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,080
is equal to e n minus one and we already

422
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,520
proved that these here it doesn't matter

423
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,919
whether you're looking at the previous

424
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:08,080
one that they converge to e uniformly

425
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,080
right this is a uniform convergence

426
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,320
convergence

427
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,320
on this interval here

428
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:27,559
and then obviously three obviously the

429
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,559
en prime here they're polinomial

430
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,559
so so continuous

431
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Right.

432
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,600
So now we have that um so we have so so

433
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,600
therefore

434
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,600
therefore

435
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,520
by the the

436
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,240
uh the there exists some function f. So

437
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,840
that these are converge to this

438
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,559
uniformly.

439
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,559
That's no great surprise.

440
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:20,880
And we also have that this thing here

441
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:26,279
the derivative converts to the

442
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,279
derivative of this here uniformly.

443
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,720
And again this is on intervals of this

444
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,720
form.

445
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:41,600
Right? Well, we already know that this

446
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:43,360
that it converts uniformly, right?

447
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,440
This is just by I mean it can only

448
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,200
convert to one function, right? Because

449
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,320
uniform convergence means that it's

450
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,200
converging pointwise at each x and

451
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,320
pointwise convergence then the limit is

452
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:00,000
is is just one thing. So we already know

453
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,159
that this here is e of x.

454
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,480
So you see that this the conclusion here

455
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:09,360
we get is now

456
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:14,000
that um that these

457
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:17,360
the and this here sorry is as we said e

458
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,039
n minus one. So the conclusion that we

459
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:24,399
get is that the e so this is the

460
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:28,000
conclusion from the theorem up there

461
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:31,120
that this e n minus one

462
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,279
converge uniformly

463
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,760
to the derivative

464
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,760
of this function.

465
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:43,120
Right?

466
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:46,720
Like the theorem said that if you have

467
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:51,120
these three condition

468
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,919
then there exist a function f so that is

469
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,720
differentiable and the derivative of it

470
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,360
is continuous and you have these two

471
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,640
properties but we already know that

472
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,600
these converts to this so we've already

473
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,720
identified what this function is so the

474
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,880
theorem just give us that function must

475
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,320
be derivative differentiable and the

476
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,240
derivative continuous.

477
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,360
But and now we try to figure out what

478
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,480
that derivative is. But the derivative

479
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,559
of these functions are the same

480
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,000
functions we started with but just

481
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,600
shifted one backwards. Right? So these

482
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,679
here

483
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,000
these here

484
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:38,080
also they converge to this. That's what

485
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,039
the theorem say. But but the

486
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:46,000
but the en minus one

487
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:49,120
they also converge to e right. So this

488
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,799
means that that these two functions here

489
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,559
this here

490
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:57,600
and this here must be the same

491
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,360
right. So this means that e is

492
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,559
differentiable

493
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,600
and the derivative is itself.

494
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,919
Yeah. Um so we define this for like all

495
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,880
n

496
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,360
>> this here was for all this here was this

497
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,799
here was defined for

498
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,799
any non- negative integer

499
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,120
right and so

500
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,279
I mean when I'm talking about down here

501
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,960
then I'm saying about n bigger equal to

502
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,159
one because I didn't strictly speak

503
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,159
define e minus one.

504
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,240
Okay.

505
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,159
So now I want to sort of do this more

506
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,039
generally.

507
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:55,720
So

508
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,720
I take a power series.

509
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,120
Also by the way the plan uh so after

510
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:12,399
this lectures there's two more lectures

511
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Thursday and Tuesday next week and um

512
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:19,840
and uh right and and and the my plan is

513
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,960
uh it's I already updated the you know

514
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,360
the course plan to reflect this. So my

515
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,960
plan is like next time I will prove

516
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,960
existence of uniqueness of some OD

517
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,440
uh using things we have learned here you

518
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,000
know about metric spaces and then

519
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,760
Tuesday next week we'll do a review of

520
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,120
the class so there won't be any new

521
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,120
material on Tuesday. Okay.

522
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,229
[Applause]

523
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:07,440
also for whatever it was. I decided in

524
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,720
the end with a friend to turn in the

525
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,600
lecture notes to to turn it into a book

526
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,279
just because the TBB I that was like the

527
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,640
main reference I didn't find that great

528
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:21,279
anyway. It was also you know at thousand

529
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,240
pages you know who know when I reach

530
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,720
thousand pages right so and so the

531
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,960
course not here is like shorter as you

532
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,440
probably have seen and trying to focus

533
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:36,480
on on the uh you know the key points.

534
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,039
Okay. So, so eventually

535
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,039
there will be a book.

536
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,039
Um,

537
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,519
okay. So now,

538
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:04,399
so now, um, right. So now I want to to

539
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,480
do this sort of more generally. So I

540
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:09,760
take we take a power series. So we have

541
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,639
a as a sequence and we're looking at a

542
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,960
power series like this. So this is a

543
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,960
power series

544
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,100
and uh so just rem to remind you the

545
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,000
radius of convergence

546
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:33,399
[Applause]

547
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,399
of convergence

548
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:44,879
is given as as follows. So we take um we

549
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,480
take m and m is defined to be the lean

550
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,200
soup

551
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,800
as n go to infinity

552
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,480
of the n root

553
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,240
of

554
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:02,640
absolute value of a n right and then the

555
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:07,359
radius of convergence so r here is then

556
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:10,560
1 / m with this usual uh convention that

557
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:14,160
if m is infinity, this here is zero. If

558
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,839
m is zero, this here is infinity, right?

559
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:22,640
And so then we have again that we have

560
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:27,280
that. So we have that the the series

561
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:33,680
here. So if you're looking at this k = z

562
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:35,599
up to n of a n xn this here converge

563
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,000
to this

564
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,000
limit here

565
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,560
uh uniformly

566
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:56,400
on

567
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:59,520
each interval of this form. here where

568
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,520
where L here is strictly this and that.

569
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,720
Okay.

570
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,720
And this is again this here is is

571
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,720
biocest.

572
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,240
Now what I'm interested in is I'm

573
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:30,160
interested in uh so I want to be able to

574
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,720
calculate the derivative of this. So, so

575
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,440
we so we define

576
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,599
so we define a function

577
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,320
f by

578
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:43,520
that uh f ofx

579
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:49,640
is equal to the sum here from k = z to

580
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,640
infinity. So this is the power series x

581
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:57,040
to k like that.

582
00:36:52,880 --> 00:37:00,359
And we want to uh want

583
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,359
a formula

584
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:10,960
for uh for the derivative and in fact I

585
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:17,000
want a formula for any derivative of uh

586
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,000
so say the m derivative of this function

587
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:28,880
and so uh right So now I uh look at so

588
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:32,240
we have take this power series and I'm

589
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,480
looking at the power series that is

590
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,800
given by

591
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,760
um

592
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,720
right so if I take so uh it's supposed

593
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:46,560
to looking at the power series where for

594
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:52,079
each term so you have in the original

595
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:59,040
power it's a n time x to the n then I'm

596
00:37:52,079 --> 00:38:01,760
looking at n a n * x

597
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:06,800
uh -1

598
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:10,160
like this right so and here I'm summing

599
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:14,920
from um

600
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,920
from uh from one

601
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,240
uh I mean it doesn't matter sum from

602
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:23,040
zero

603
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:25,599
so zero to infinity like Yeah.

604
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:30,800
Now the radius of convergence for this.

605
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:34,119
So what is the radius of convergence? So

606
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,119
of convergence.

607
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,400
Uh the radius of convergence for this is

608
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,920
um

609
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:50,079
is the nth root

610
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:53,400
of n * a to the n

611
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,400
like this.

612
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:03,920
And this in here is the same as n to the

613
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:06,640
power 1 / n * the nth root of a n like

614
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,240
this. Right?

615
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:14,800
Now this thing here if you're looking at

616
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:19,839
n like this this here is you can write

617
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:25,040
this thing here as e and then it's log n

618
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:27,520
/ n. This here as n goes to infinity

619
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:32,640
converts to zero. So this thing here

620
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:35,920
converts to to one by e to the one.

621
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:39,480
And so you have that lean soup here. So

622
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,480
the lim soup

623
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:49,440
of the nth root of n * a n like this

624
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,960
this thing here is because this here

625
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,400
right you can write this it's the same

626
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:58,240
as li soup

627
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:01,200
n go to infinity n go to infinity it's

628
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:05,200
the same as the n root of of this in

629
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,839
here times the n root of like this this

630
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:12,320
here converts to one. So it really just

631
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:17,200
converts. So it's equal to the limb soup

632
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:22,320
as n go to infinity of the nth root of

633
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:24,720
a. Right? So and that was what we call m

634
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,480
originally.

635
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,520
So

636
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,800
this this limb soup is the same as this

637
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,280
limb soup. So this means that m from for

638
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,760
this new sequence is the same as m for

639
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:42,240
the old sequence. So this means that the

640
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,480
radius convergence for the new sequence

641
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,680
is equal to the radius of convergence

642
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,599
from the old sequence.

643
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,599
Right?

644
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:56,880
So if you take the derivative term by

645
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:58,960
term and you form this new power series

646
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,720
then it has the same radius of

647
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,720
convergence. That's the original passes.

648
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,160
Okay. And so now you can iterate this.

649
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,200
So you can iterate this.

650
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:27,680
So you can take the So this is just

651
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,280
taking the derivative term by term one

652
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,880
time.

653
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,400
If you now take the uh derivative

654
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,400
suppose you're starting with this

655
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,400
sequence here.

656
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,760
So you're starting with with sorry with

657
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:46,720
this power series and you're taking the

658
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,960
derivative term by term then you get as

659
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:52,000
we did up there you're getting this

660
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,119
power sh

661
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,119
now you take a derivative again term by

662
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,119
term.

663
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,720
So you're getting this right and the

664
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,839
thing is that each time the radius of

665
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,839
convergence for this same radius of

666
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,839
convergence

667
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,319
these two here same radius of

668
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,880
convergence

669
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:32,200
right it's because of the same principle

670
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,200
same radius

671
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,680
and and and so on. And so you can

672
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,680
continue.

673
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,880
And if you do this

674
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:50,480
um if you do this uh m time

675
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:54,800
then you're getting n

676
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,640
uh then so right. So if you right so if

677
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:01,520
you do this

678
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:05,200
um m times then you get that this thing

679
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:10,880
here is x

680
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:14,400
uh - m and you're getting a n and here

681
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,640
you're getting uh n

682
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,880
minus one

683
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:23,200
n minus 2 up to

684
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,960
uh n

685
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:29,280
min - m + 1

686
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,160
right this would give you so you're

687
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,800
getting that right

688
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,280
so that is after this is when you do it

689
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,960
m times and so again these here will

690
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,960
have the same radius convergence right

691
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
now

692
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,440
yeah now this thing here right so what

693
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,760
is So n if I want to write this a little

694
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,599
bit more compactly

695
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:04,800
if I'm thinking about this thing here n

696
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:10,480
minus 2 up to n minus m + one I can

697
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:14,319
write this thing here as n factorial

698
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:18,400
and then uh but then I getting all these

699
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:20,560
so if I wrote it as n factorial then I

700
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,800
would also have

701
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:29,680
Right? It would keep going like this and

702
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:31,599
the next one here would be n minus m.

703
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,720
Right? So if I writing so I can write

704
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:39,880
this thing here times this factorial is

705
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,880
equal to that. Right? Yeah. Sorry.

706
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,560
>> Right.

707
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,560
So,

708
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:56,400
>> so I think you were complaining about

709
00:44:52,400 --> 00:45:01,040
one thing that I sort of uh pushed under

710
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:06,440
the rock and that is the following

711
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,440
that if you if you take

712
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,000
the way we define so if you take a power

713
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,720
series

714
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,440
again like this and you define the

715
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,440
radius of convergence

716
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,280
then you define it from this n element

717
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,599
right I think that's what you're

718
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,720
complaining about and so you take the

719
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,359
the coefficient to the n power that's

720
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,800
not exactly what I did is that what

721
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,520
you're complaining about yeah

722
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,920
>> and and that doesn't matter right and

723
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:43,119
and the thing is that so when you define

724
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,160
the rate of convergence

725
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:49,359
you took this n power like this right

726
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:52,640
but this was to to this it was coicient

727
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:55,440
to where this here was to the end when

728
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,760
I'm doing it over here I there's two

729
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,240
ways of dealing with it one is the one

730
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,480
you suggest I mean and the other one and

731
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,599
that was why I put it under you know I

732
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,280
swept it under the rock is that that the

733
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,319
way

734
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,119
the the radius this with the radius

735
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:15,680
convergence it comes from comparing it

736
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,920
with a geometric series and then it

737
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,839
really doesn't matter for this term in

738
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,160
terms of x whether you have shifted it

739
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:26,560
or not. Okay. But if you do it um if you

740
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:29,119
do it as you suggesting which would be

741
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:32,640
totally fine

742
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:35,520
then let's see. So then listening here

743
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:39,599
what you really should have done is that

744
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:42,400
we should have thought about this n a n

745
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,640
and then we should take the this here

746
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,480
and we should take instead of the n root

747
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,520
we should take the n minus one root

748
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,359
right but that doesn't matter either

749
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,200
right that's going to be the same also

750
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:56,079
yeah so either way you can check either

751
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,319
of these two things and I was thinking

752
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:01,040
about the first and that where it's

753
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,040
coming from

754
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:13,760
Okay. So,

755
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:17,599
so now um right so sorry now I lost my

756
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:20,400
thread here. So I was just observing

757
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:26,000
that if you write if you can write the n

758
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:28,720
factorial as first taking all of these

759
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,560
factors and then taking n minus one

760
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:37,280
right so this means that

761
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:40,319
that n factorial divided by n minus one

762
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,240
sorry n minus m

763
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:46,319
factorial

764
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:48,400
this is equal to n -1

765
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:56,680
n -2

766
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:56,680
down to n - m + one like that right

767
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:03,200
but you see that's exactly what we have

768
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:07,720
down here right so this thing here so so

769
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,720
what I conclude from this is

770
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,960
that if I take a power series

771
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,240
If I take a power s

772
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,920
if I take a power series like this

773
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,680
uh and I take the derivative term by

774
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:42,559
term

775
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:46,319
then and I do this k uh m times Then

776
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:50,400
this is what I get is n factorial

777
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:56,880
n - m factorial

778
00:48:50,400 --> 00:49:01,319
and then a n x m n minus

779
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,319
m right.

780
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:09,119
Okay. So the and we also so this is when

781
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:12,720
we do it term by term taking the

782
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,960
derivative and we already have that

783
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,960
these here have the same radius of

784
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,960
conversion.

785
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,359
Okay.

786
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:31,559
And so now

787
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,559
so now we have a funny theorem

788
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:39,960
that if you take a power series so you

789
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,960
take a power series like this

790
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:44,839
uh r is the radius of converting

791
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,200
convergence.

792
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,920
uh and if L here is strictly less some

793
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,720
positive number but strictly less than

794
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:07,720
the radius of convergence

795
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,720
then uh then these guys here

796
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:14,800
these guys here converge to uh right so

797
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:20,280
these when you're summing when you take

798
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:20,280
a finite sum sorry these here converge

799
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:29,800
to to is uh uniformly. But not only

800
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,800
these

801
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,200
uniformly.

802
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:45,520
But not only that, but you also have

803
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:50,240
that more interestingly, you have that

804
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:53,520
um that this sequence here

805
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:56,319
uh um

806
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:58,559
k

807
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:03,359
minus

808
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:06,720
k minus k minus uh m

809
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:12,880
sorry uh k factorial

810
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:14,800
divided by k minus m factorial

811
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,880
a

812
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:20,960
uh k

813
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:24,240
uh x k - m

814
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,760
that this sequence here converge

815
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:29,119
uniformly

816
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:36,160
to the derivative

817
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:36,160
this is f ofx to the to the m derivative

818
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,920
of x of f.

819
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,920
So we have that these functions but that

820
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,280
we already prove that these functions

821
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:50,280
here converge and their derivative here

822
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,280
converge

823
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,880
uniformly like this

824
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,680
on the same.

825
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,960
Okay.

826
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:13,440
Now why is this the case?

827
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:17,880
So this here is again it's following so

828
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,880
this follows to prove

829
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,559
follows from the same theorem

830
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,319
follows

831
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:30,440
from

832
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,440
the theorem we proved earlier.

833
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,760
we showed earlier

834
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,960
and let's just go through that.

835
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:46,440
So let me go through it. So let's assume

836
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,440
assume first

837
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:56,720
that that m is equal to one.

838
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:59,040
Right? So I just take one derivative.

839
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,760
Well, then I'm looking at I'm getting

840
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:04,960
I'm looking at this sequence here.

841
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,040
Sorry. K X K

842
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,119
K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K

843
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,760
K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K

844
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:10,079
K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K

845
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:13,839
= Z to N. I'm looking at these that

846
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:16,800
converge to this

847
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:20,440
infinite this this two to two to it they

848
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,440
converge to f

849
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,839
right f again is this infinite power s

850
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:29,599
and I'm looking at the derivative of

851
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:32,559
these guys so these are this

852
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:36,400
and I know now

853
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,920
that these here converge

854
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,160
uniformly

855
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,640
and these This here converts uniformly

856
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:45,200
to the power series that is this

857
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:48,640
infinite series. Right? This here was

858
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,400
the finite part of it and this here it's

859
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,400
like the infinite you know the whole

860
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,400
thing

861
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,240
right. So we have that

862
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:11,599
this means in particular that so this

863
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:14,720
thing here implies of course that um

864
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:18,400
that when you're looking at the at at

865
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:21,760
zero when you're looking at zero by if

866
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:25,119
you evaluate this thing here at zero

867
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:28,319
then in this one here you get in this

868
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:32,640
this is the sequence of functions

869
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:37,319
fn of x from before. These are the fn

870
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,319
prime of x,

871
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:44,640
right? And so now I claim that so so the

872
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:48,720
theorem that we proved earlier is that

873
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:50,559
if you take a sequence of functions

874
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,960
that are

875
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:54,720
differentiable and their derivative is

876
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,960
continuous, these are all polinomial. So

877
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,000
this is definitely the case.

878
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,520
And we know that this that these values

879
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,680
here

880
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:09,280
fn in fact at zero they're equal to f of

881
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:13,920
zero. Right? So this is like so we had

882
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:16,240
three conditions. We had that the fn in

883
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:20,079
some particular point that we call x0

884
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:22,960
this is now zero that this converge. We

885
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:25,599
have that the fp prime was converging

886
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,240
uniformly. Well, we know that these here

887
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:30,240
converge uniformly. And then we had that

888
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,920
the fprime should be continuous, but

889
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,680
they were obviously continuous. They

890
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:40,000
were polinomials, right? Then then we

891
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:43,000
had that the derivative converge

892
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
uniformly.

893
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:51,920
Um and that the and that the function

894
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:54,960
that they converge to the the derivative

895
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,960
converge and also the original functions

896
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:01,920
converge,

897
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:05,680
right? And um and that the derivative

898
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:10,079
converts uniformly to the derivative of

899
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:12,160
the function that it converts to. Right?

900
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,799
So you see that this is just checking

901
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,040
that we have the tree property from the

902
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:19,760
theorem before and then we get the two

903
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:23,440
conclusion and the one conclusion that

904
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:26,480
we're interested in is that this here is

905
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:31,160
then the power series for the derivative

906
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,160
of f. Okay.

907
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:37,280
Now

908
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:40,079
Okay. So now the so and then you can do

909
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,799
the same thing with so let me just say

910
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:48,720
that you can do the same thing if you

911
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:52,079
take um if you take um

912
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:56,480
if you if you are integrating

913
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:59,520
so so here we proved so suppose you take

914
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,920
a sequence theorem that is converging to

915
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:04,240
f well suppose you take a power series

916
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,240
here

917
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:08,599
Suppose you take this power series

918
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:16,480
uh k x k=

919
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:19,760
to zero. So this is the finite this is

920
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:22,240
the power series

921
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:27,440
and suppose I'm interested in what is

922
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:29,599
the integral from a to b of

923
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,000
this power series

924
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:36,400
f ofx

925
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:43,040
dx right and here I'm assuming that a

926
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:46,079
and b are in the uh are um in the

927
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:49,119
interval where the power shares is

928
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:52,079
converging. So you have this right? So

929
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:54,799
this means of course that if you think

930
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:58,640
about it that you have here zero, you

931
00:57:54,799 --> 00:58:00,799
have r you have here minus r and then a

932
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,920
and b is lying and so this means that

933
00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:08,559
this whole interval is lying comfortably

934
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:11,280
inside some interval like this.

935
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:13,920
Right?

936
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,640
Okay. And I'm asking

937
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,640
what is a nice formula for this this

938
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:21,119
integral here.

939
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:24,240
And so then

940
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:26,480
well uh I can use not the theorem we

941
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:30,559
proved earlier but the theorem we proved

942
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:34,960
last time. And so what is that? So if I

943
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:42,480
define f(n) of x to be equal to the sum

944
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:45,839
here from k = to zero to n of a k x k

945
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:49,359
sorry x to power k.

946
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:53,359
These thing here, these here converge

947
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:54,960
uniformly to f ofx

948
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:58,240
on

949
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:00,640
any interval like this when l here is

950
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,799
strictly less than the radius of

951
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:06,440
convergence. Right? So they converge

952
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:06,440
here uniformly.

953
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:13,440
But the theorem we proved earlier was

954
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:16,319
that if you take a uniform convergence

955
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:19,119
like this and you take a and b in this

956
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:22,119
integral then the integral of these guys

957
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,119
here

958
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,280
converge to the integral

959
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:35,599
like this. Right? We have this

960
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:39,200
convergence here. But these here are

961
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:42,000
easy to integrate right

962
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:45,720
these these guys

963
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,720
but because they're polinomial

964
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:53,680
so the polomium so this means that the

965
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:57,680
fn

966
00:59:53,680 --> 01:00:02,319
s the fns of s when you integrate this

967
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:05,599
from a to b ds these guys are the sum

968
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:08,079
here of A

969
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:11,839
uh K sorry

970
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,920
uh S K

971
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:12,000
K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K

972
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,480
K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K

973
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,599
K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K K

974
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:21,440
= Z to N and then the integral here

975
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:24,079
D S from A to B, right fine? Because

976
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,799
it's just that polomial. And so for

977
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:34,880
polomium well we can just use that it's

978
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:39,520
a sum of the of these guys a k sk

979
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:43,680
k = to zero to n right and this thing

980
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:46,720
here when we integrate this that's just

981
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:49,200
that's just um

982
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:52,160
that's just the I mean now it doesn't

983
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:56,079
get much nicer unless you make one of

984
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:59,599
them equal to zero.

985
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:04,480
So, so you have this. So, let me say

986
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:08,319
that if a here was equal to zero

987
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:12,000
and and and

988
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:14,000
b was equal to x. So if that's the case

989
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,520
and you're looking at this integral from

990
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:21,839
0 to x of fn

991
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:24,079
s ds, we know that this here converts to

992
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:28,920
the integral

993
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:28,920
right of the power series.

994
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:36,040
On the other hand, this integral here,

995
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,040
right? You know if

996
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,680
on the other hand

997
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:51,160
um on the other hand this integral here

998
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,160
if you're looking at the sum here

999
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:06,319
and then sum and now the a is zero b is

1000
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:09,760
x so then is this here a k x k

1001
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:11,599
now when we integrate this term here

1002
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:16,000
we're getting right so we're getting the

1003
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:17,520
sum here k = z to n and then this here

1004
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,280
becomes

1005
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,920
a

1006
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:25,200
um k

1007
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:29,040
+ 1

1008
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:32,920
um x to the power k

1009
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,920
+ one Right.

1010
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:40,720
And so you see that if you're looking at

1011
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:45,760
so you see that these guys here now

1012
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:50,160
converge to the to the integral from

1013
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:52,400
zero to x of f of s

1014
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:56,000
gs right that's what we get from the

1015
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:59,280
theorem. So the conclusion here is that

1016
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,440
if you take a power series

1017
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,480
um and you're looking inside the radius

1018
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:07,280
of convergence then the power series is

1019
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:10,480
differentiable as many times as you want

1020
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:13,119
and the derivative is given by power

1021
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:16,480
series and it's just the derivative of

1022
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:19,200
the ter individual term by term right

1023
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:21,359
and likewise if you want to integrate a

1024
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:24,240
power series

1025
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:25,920
then the integral So at least when

1026
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,680
you're integrating because otherwise the

1027
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,079
formula is not quite as nice but you get

1028
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:33,760
a but you do get a formula but it does

1029
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:36,799
doesn't look so nice but the integral of

1030
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:40,480
a power series you can just integrate it

1031
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:42,799
term by term right

1032
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:45,760
okay so now the next thing we want to

1033
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:48,640
talk about um and that's I'm just trying

1034
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:51,839
to set up for next uh for for the next

1035
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:54,480
lecture and so this is we want to talk

1036
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:58,480
about uh differential equations and how

1037
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:00,720
we using some of the stuff that we

1038
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,359
proven in this class to solve

1039
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:05,920
differential equation and in and it's

1040
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:07,920
like an example where it may not be very

1041
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:09,520
obvious

1042
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:13,520
um

1043
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:17,440
that you could use metric spaces to

1044
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:20,000
solve a differential equation

1045
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:23,520
but but this is nevertheless the case.

1046
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:26,520
So, so we're looking at a differential

1047
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,520
equation.

1048
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:37,079
So, a differential equation is an

1049
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,079
equation

1050
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,400
is an equation

1051
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:47,640
in an unknown.

1052
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,000
in an unknown function

1053
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:59,160
uh and its derivative.

1054
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:11,200
So let me give you some examples of this

1055
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:15,599
um that you take uh you're looking at uh

1056
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:17,680
at a function f you're trying to find a

1057
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:20,000
function f

1058
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:23,359
so that so this is like the first

1059
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:27,359
example you have you're looking for a

1060
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:29,839
function f so that the derivative is x

1061
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:34,359
right well we already know that this

1062
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:34,359
here the solutions to This

1063
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:41,520
um um f ofx

1064
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:44,960
= to 1/2

1065
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:46,559
x^2 plus some constant right constant

1066
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,520
whatever the constant when you take

1067
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:51,760
derivative you get zero and and the

1068
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:56,160
derivative of this in here gives you x

1069
01:05:51,760 --> 01:06:00,400
right and those are the only solutions.

1070
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:03,599
Um, another example here

1071
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:08,960
is uh where you're taking something that

1072
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:13,000
looks like uh f prime minus f 2. So f

1073
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,000
ofx like this.

1074
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,640
And if you're looking at the function

1075
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:24,319
here

1076
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:27,119
um f ofx = 1 - 1 /x. If you take this

1077
01:06:24,319 --> 01:06:29,119
function here and now you take the

1078
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:31,200
derivative.

1079
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:35,280
So now I'm using the chain rule. So I

1080
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:38,160
get 1 - one like this squared and then I

1081
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:40,319
take the derivative of this. So that's -

1082
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:43,839
x

1083
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:46,880
- one sorry - one.

1084
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:54,160
So that's -1 * -1.

1085
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:56,559
So this here is - 1 - x².

1086
01:06:54,160 --> 01:07:01,480
And so you see that when you take this

1087
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:01,480
function here with a minus sign.

1088
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:13,119
Uh

1089
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,960
right. So,

1090
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,200
so when you take I think it should be a

1091
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,680
plus, right?

1092
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,440
So, when you take

1093
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:23,599
>> No, no, no. It should be minus. No,

1094
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:26,160
that's right. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

1095
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:30,000
I did this one wrong. This here should

1096
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:32,720
have been a minus like that, right?

1097
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:36,670
And so, this here is now is indeed plus

1098
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:40,240
and then it's this equation.

1099
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:43,240
[Applause]

1100
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,240
Okay,

1101
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:51,039
the next example

1102
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:54,559
um another so again if the equation is

1103
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:59,200
something that involved a fun unknown

1104
01:07:54,559 --> 01:08:01,520
function and its derivative

1105
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:04,240
uh so suppose you take something that

1106
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:08,000
looks like f fprime

1107
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:10,240
fprime equal to zero

1108
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,839
if you're taking the function

1109
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:16,159
f= to some constant,

1110
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:21,440
this is a solution.

1111
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:24,080
And if you're taking f= to say um x or

1112
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:28,759
some constant times x, this is is also a

1113
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:28,759
solution. They're both solutions.

1114
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:35,279
And this is just because the second in

1115
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:38,080
this case, the second derivative is

1116
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:40,640
zero.

1117
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:44,799
Okay. So now what we will be interested

1118
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:46,480
in is uh we're going to be interested in

1119
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:50,799
uh what's called an ordinary

1120
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:52,640
differential equation. It's it's it's

1121
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:57,480
and we only looked at this we only

1122
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,480
looked as function of just one variable

1123
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:05,400
if it's

1124
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:05,400
so this is what the ordinary refer to.

1125
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:09,640
So we want to look at ordinary

1126
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:15,799
differential equation

1127
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,719
and an ordinary

1128
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:24,400
differential equation is abbreviated by

1129
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:27,120
OD

1130
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:30,960
and this is uh and if it's not an

1131
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:34,080
ordinary then it's usually a partial uh

1132
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:37,359
differential equation which involve a

1133
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:40,400
function that is uh that is of more than

1134
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:42,159
one variable. So it will involve the

1135
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:44,960
what's called the partial derivative of

1136
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:49,359
the functions.

1137
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:52,839
Okay. And the the so the unknown so the

1138
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,839
unknown function

1139
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,640
function

1140
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:01,719
uh will be denoted

1141
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:11,199
by y.

1142
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:16,320
And the equation that we're looking at

1143
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:19,199
is that we want some particular value at

1144
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:21,840
say zero.

1145
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:24,400
And then we want

1146
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:27,360
uh that the derivative satisfying an

1147
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:31,120
equation. And the der equation that

1148
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:32,320
we're looking for is that we have so we

1149
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:38,640
have

1150
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:42,320
um we have um so f here and g are given.

1151
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:46,080
So think about those as functions that

1152
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:48,800
are given. Those are two given functions

1153
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:50,880
but you know they may not be super nice

1154
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,280
and but you know that f is

1155
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:58,400
differentiable

1156
01:10:53,280 --> 01:11:02,840
and the derivative is continuous

1157
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,840
and g here is continuous

1158
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:10,239
but in principle you know they're given

1159
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:12,239
and now you're looking for a but it

1160
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:16,320
might be very very complicated maybe f

1161
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:20,400
is sign or you know something like that.

1162
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:23,760
Uh and so you're looking for a a unknown

1163
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:27,840
function y so that the derivative so y

1164
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:31,600
we think about y as a function of x

1165
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:35,040
and the derivative of y is supposed to

1166
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:37,040
be equal to f but is now applied to this

1167
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:40,560
unknown function

1168
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:42,960
and then plus g of x. Right? So this

1169
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:45,120
here is much more tame but this is a bit

1170
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:48,159
complicated because it involved the

1171
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:52,560
unknown function. Okay. And so we want

1172
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:54,320
to we want to so we want to see so we

1173
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:57,640
are asking

1174
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,640
so question

1175
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:04,239
does this equation

1176
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:07,239
does this

1177
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:07,239
OD

1178
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,920
have a solution

1179
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,760
and if

1180
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:22,440
Um is the solution

1181
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,000
uh unique?

1182
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,239
Right? So by this we mean right? So

1183
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:38,120
we're looking for a function. So so

1184
01:12:34,239 --> 01:12:38,120
here's what we're looking for.

1185
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:47,440
We're looking for a function y defined

1186
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:50,080
on some interval into r. This function

1187
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:52,800
has to be differentiable. So this has to

1188
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:56,320
exist.

1189
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:59,840
A zero has to be in that interval,

1190
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:02,159
right? Because we want this is a is just

1191
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:08,080
a constant, right?

1192
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:12,679
And so so and then we want then we want

1193
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:12,679
obviously y to satisfy

1194
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:22,480
uh this this equation here

1195
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,040
right

1196
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:28,159
that's what we're looking for. So this

1197
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:32,080
is existence. They're saying that what

1198
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:34,640
we will prove is that there exists some

1199
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:37,880
interal. So, so we want so we will prove

1200
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,880
the following.

1201
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:45,199
So, we prove the following theorem of

1202
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:48,159
which is has many different names and is

1203
01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:50,320
attributed to various people.

1204
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:53,920
Um

1205
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:57,199
but it's I guess

1206
01:13:53,920 --> 01:14:00,080
uh um in

1207
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:03,040
it's

1208
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:04,640
often most often

1209
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:08,080
uh

1210
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:12,960
named the pic lindelof theorem

1211
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:15,360
and so this is that um that's um that

1212
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:20,320
given

1213
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:22,000
f and and g as a bound so f has to be

1214
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:24,239
differentiable

1215
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,400
and the derivative continuous g just has

1216
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:30,320
to be continuous

1217
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:33,520
Then there exist then

1218
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:37,400
for any

1219
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,400
a there exist

1220
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:47,520
a delta greater than zero

1221
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:51,719
um such that and a solution

1222
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,719
and a solution

1223
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:59,280
to this differential equation this OD

1224
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:02,880
um um

1225
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:05,440
on the integral from minus delta to

1226
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:08,880
delta.

1227
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:12,560
So we just prove we prove that there

1228
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:16,080
exist a solution near the origin. The

1229
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:18,719
thing is that a solution may blow up. So

1230
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:21,040
it may not exist on a very long

1231
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:25,120
interval. It may just exist on a smaller

1232
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:27,360
interval. is all depending on f and g

1233
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:33,880
but in particular will depend on f.

1234
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:33,880
Okay. So it's uh and and that moreover

1235
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:39,480
uh it is unique

1236
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:45,679
meaning that if you take another

1237
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:48,880
solution

1238
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:53,640
defined on the same interval then it

1239
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:53,640
must be that solution. Okay.

1240
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:59,440
And so,

1241
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:02,000
so now I just have a minute or two, but

1242
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:05,840
but we'll prove this next time anyway,

1243
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:08,480
but I just want to

1244
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:11,760
um as a teaser, if you will, I will just

1245
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:15,080
say that. So, the proof of this,

1246
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,080
so the proof

1247
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:22,000
the proof

1248
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,000
uh uses

1249
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:27,719
Uh the contracting mapping zoom

1250
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:32,840
mapping the

1251
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:41,719
I'll remind you what that is. Maybe I'll

1252
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:41,719
remind you what it is. So the so recall

1253
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,159
that the contracting mapping system

1254
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:56,600
is the following

1255
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:03,520
that suppose you take a metric space X

1256
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:07,760
and D.

1257
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:10,480
So D is a metric, X is a space.

1258
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:13,920
And suppose you take a map

1259
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:17,360
from X to itself.

1260
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:23,960
Then X is so then T. So T here is a map

1261
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:23,960
from X to itself. T is set to be

1262
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,280
a contracting map.

1263
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:39,840
If if there exists some constant that

1264
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:43,120
constant and that's key it has to be

1265
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:45,440
strictly less than one so that if you

1266
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:47,679
measure distances

1267
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:52,560
between the images

1268
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:57,440
so for any X and Y in capital X

1269
01:17:52,560 --> 01:18:00,480
this is for all X and Y in capital X if

1270
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:02,640
you look at the distance between the

1271
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:06,159
images of these two points

1272
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:09,760
then it's less or equal to this constant

1273
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:13,760
that is strictly less than one

1274
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:15,760
like this. Okay. So that's a contracting

1275
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:18,080
map

1276
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,840
and the contracting mapping theorem that

1277
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:23,520
we prove I I'll remind you about it

1278
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,440
again next time but just

1279
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,920
the contracting mapping theorem that we

1280
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:29,840
prove this that so we prove the

1281
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:33,520
following theorem which is a contracting

1282
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:37,520
mapping theorem that if

1283
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,520
X here is cushy complete

1284
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:48,880
Then and

1285
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:53,159
and t from x to x

1286
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:53,159
is a contracting map

1287
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,400
matching map.

1288
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,640
Then

1289
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:08,320
t

1290
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:11,640
has a unique

1291
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,640
fix point.

1292
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:19,120
So a there's a unique so there exist a

1293
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:22,960
unique one often write like this there

1294
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:26,960
exist one and only one x

1295
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:31,920
so that f so that or x0

1296
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:33,760
so that this map takes x0 to itself so

1297
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:38,000
that's a contracting mapping theorem

1298
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:41,920
okay and so now so it seems like that

1299
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:45,040
what does od has to do with this

1300
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:48,480
abstract concept of a metric space. So

1301
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:52,800
it's it's tied together using this

1302
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:56,719
and then the space X it's not. You may

1303
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:58,320
think that it's it's you may think

1304
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:00,719
that's close, but it's not quite the

1305
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:02,960
case. You may think that it's like a

1306
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:07,600
continuous function on an interval like

1307
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:09,360
this. That's close. That's this here is

1308
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,600
you may think that because that's a

1309
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:13,920
space we've talked about a lot. this

1310
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:16,400
here with this metric D we talked about

1311
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,320
with this maximum distance. It's not

1312
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:21,120
actually quite the case. It's a little

1313
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:24,239
bit more complicated than this.

1314
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:28,400
The x is but x is related to this

1315
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:32,880
because x here would be a ball

1316
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:37,040
around the function that is constant

1317
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:39,280
um the function that is constant a

1318
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:42,320
in this space

1319
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:45,760
and and we have to choose this r

1320
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:48,640
carefully. Okay. And so that's a space

1321
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:51,280
X. And now I haven't defined the the fun

1322
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:54,080
the map G, but we'll do that next time.

1323
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:57,400
And I will remind you about this also.

1324
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:57,400
Any questions?
