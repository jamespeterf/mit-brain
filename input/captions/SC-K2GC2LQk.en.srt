1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,400
My name is Kik. I'm visiting scholar

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,960
here at MIT. I'm actually assistant

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,920
professor at poly techchnical university

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,039
of Madrid. And my background is actually

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,480
on engineering. I am aerospace engineer.

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,800
Uh I did my PhD on numerical methods.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,760
But uh after my post dog I decided to

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,840
start doing things that really

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,760
passionates me and that's how I end up

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,399
doing something related with music. No.

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,160
So I'm relatively new in this field and

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,120
today I'm going to show you an algorithm

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,600
that I came up for pattern detection in

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,440
music which is what I've been working on

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,840
for the last year and a half more or

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,000
less. So as running example uh I'm going

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:57,840
to use the most listened song of the

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,320
history which is uh Baby Sark.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,920
>> So I don't know if I can play it. Yeah.

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,559
At least it's the most listened song of

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,559
the history of YouTube.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,880
>> Baby Shark doo doo doo doo doo doo. Baby

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,040
Shark doo doo doo doo doo doo. Baby

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,240
Shark doo doo doo doo doo doo. Baby

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,799
Shark,

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,880
>> Mommy Shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,880
Mommy shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,159
Mommy shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo.

29
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Mommy shark,

30
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,920
>> pretty much like that all the song. This

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,479
is the melody. So what's the problem of

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,759
pattern detection in music? Okay, we

33
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,320
would like to have a tool, an automatic

34
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,119
to tool that help us to identify over

35
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,240
the score or over a corpus like the

36
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,040
important musical ideas there. No. So

37
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm highlighting here some fragments.

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,280
Have a look first at the blue fragment

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,759
over there. There are three fragments,

40
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,399
three occurrences of them. All of them

41
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,920
are exactly the same. They have the same

42
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,320
notes with the same pitches and same

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,320
durations. The only difference is that

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,880
they occur at different moment of the

45
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,119
score. But it seems logical. It seems

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,879
reasonable to group them as the same

47
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,599
musical idea and say that they represent

48
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,959
the same the same pattern. No, we can

49
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,520
call them uh we can put them a label

50
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,080
blue pattern. Okay, for the green one is

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,560
a little trickier because the occurrence

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,480
number two and the occurrence number

53
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,840
three are exactly the same. Okay,

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,400
probably makes sense to group them

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,519
together. Occurrence number one has a

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,360
different durations for the notes and

57
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,080
the occurrence number four is even

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,040
trickier because

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,640
they just serve with the rest that it's

60
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,280
three notes also and the lyrics. No, but

61
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,680
it's pretty different. No. So that's one

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,080
of the main difficulties of the problem

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,959
of pattern mining in music that even

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,440
though uh objects that we want to group

65
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,560
together because in our mind represent

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,959
the same musical idea over the table

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,680
they might look pretty different and

68
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,200
there are two mechanisms involved here.

69
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,599
The first one is something that we have

70
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,959
already studied the transformations. So

71
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,040
if we have a a music fragment, if we

72
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,480
apply the mathematical transformation

73
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,040
over the notes there, we obtain other

74
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,800
fragments that under some circumstances

75
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,400
our mind will process them as

76
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,360
equivalent.

77
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,360
And how to deal with this

78
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,760
computationally from the point of view

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,080
of a pattern mining algorithm? My

80
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,519
approach was to use the concept of

81
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,640
viewpoint. I'm going to show you an

82
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,920
example of what is this about but for

83
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,159
the moment it's enough to know that it

84
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,120
it's it have a double task know on the

85
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,799
first hand um it directly takes into

86
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,720
account this transformations you will

87
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,200
see it in a minute and probably more

88
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,560
important it simplifies the

89
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,439
representation because one of the

90
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,319
constants in this course in this classes

91
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:04,000
is that music is something complex no it

92
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,480
has like complex logical structures

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,760
among among the elements of the score

94
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,159
and if we find a way to simplify that

95
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,360
representation would be helpful for from

96
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,359
the computational point of view. So the

97
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,120
viewpoint representation is pretty

98
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,280
simple. It's just I'm going to

99
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,280
substitute a complex tune like this one

100
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,720
by a single sequence of symbols. So

101
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,720
actually here I'm showing three

102
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,280
viewpoints representation. The pitch

103
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,680
viewpoint it's the sequence of these

104
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,840
symbols 83 83 83 85 it's the MIDI note

105
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,280
then we have the duration and the onset

106
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,520
time I'm going to highlight there a a

107
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,120
fragment so you can see the different

108
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,000
viewpoints representation for that

109
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,720
fragment and it's nice that idea of

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,520
constructing the score by overlapping

111
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,040
layers of information no that's the idea

112
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:02,240
formally a viewpoint is a mapping

113
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,840
between the current event, the current

114
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,639
time slice and all the former ones into

115
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,280
a symbol. Usually an integral or float,

116
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,080
but could be others. Those there are

117
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,039
derived viewpoints

118
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,720
and perhaps for your own particular

119
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,520
music application, you need to develop

120
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,240
your own viewpoint representation.

121
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,240
Uh and here is clearly highlighted how

122
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,840
the transformations could be directly

123
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,280
taken into account by using this

124
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,960
technique. You know for instance if you

125
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:36,000
apply uh the octave transformation to

126
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,560
that pattern there that fragment you

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,560
obtain that one over there which one

128
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,160
which by the interval uh viewpoint

129
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,160
representation

130
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,560
uh will have the same symbol. So for

131
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,400
sure any pattern mining algorithm that

132
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,039
is trying to uh find this sequence uh

133
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,120
will see that that one is the same. No.

134
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,199
Is that enough to deal with the concept

135
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,600
of dissimilarity in music?

136
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,759
Unfortunately, not. So have a look at

137
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,280
these two occurrences of the green

138
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,120
pattern of baby sark. There is no

139
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,160
viewpoint representation that can take

140
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,759
us from one to the other. So someone

141
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,720
said at some point okay it would be nice

142
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,319
to have a kind of measure uh a

143
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,319
mathematical tool that help us to

144
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,840
evaluate how different two fragments

145
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,160
are.

146
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,280
like uh the aim here is that okay if I

147
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,319
use that matrix with this guy and this

148
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,479
guy I would expect a lower value than

149
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,400
the one that I would obtain when taking

150
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:41,199
this guy and this guy no because they

151
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:44,000
are uh more far no they represent uh

152
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,080
farther ideas. So in computer science

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,840
they use what is called the distance

154
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,560
functions. is in a general scenario is

155
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,960
that you can give to a function two

156
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,520
objects two random objects for instance

157
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,120
me myself and this computer and it

158
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,280
returns a non- negative real number

159
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,080
evaluating the degree of dissimilarity

160
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,319
between the two objects in the context

161
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,240
of sequences because we are using

162
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,639
viewpoint representation so now this

163
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,280
fragment will be a sequence for instance

164
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,319
let's see let's think that I'm using the

165
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,800
duration viewpoint point. So in the

166
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,680
literature we have like plenty of

167
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,759
distance functions. This was very a very

168
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,400
trending topic in music information

169
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,160
retrieval like 15 years ago more or

170
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,599
less. There were many studies and papers

171
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,759
trying to figure out which was the best

172
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,360
distance function depending on the

173
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,240
style.

174
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,319
The lestain distance function perhaps is

175
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,919
not the most advanced one but is one of

176
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,479
the simplest one and probably the most

177
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,639
used one and it accounts for the number

178
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,919
of substitutions

179
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:58,560
or insertions to go from one sequence to

180
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,160
the other. So uh to go from the sequence

181
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,879
0.5

182
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,520
to the sequence 0.52

183
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,400
we just need a single substitution. So

184
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,639
the leven distance function between the

185
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,560
fragment two and fragment four is one.

186
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,319
Okay. Probably the leven distance

187
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,560
function between this guy and this guy

188
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,800
it's I don't know two or three at least.

189
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:24,000
No. So cool. Now we have like all the

190
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,639
ingredients needed to understand the

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,919
inputs and outputs of my algorithm. We

192
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,599
have a corpus or a piece of music. We

193
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,080
have also the viewpoint representation

194
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,719
that the user want to choose and some

195
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,479
parameters at the input. The minimum

196
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,000
support is the minimum number of

197
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,839
repetitions that we uh require to a

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,320
pattern to be considered frequent and to

199
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,080
be included in the result list. These

200
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,080
two guys the minimum length and maximum

201
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,680
length are the parameters to control the

202
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,399
lengths of the patterns that we want to

203
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,399
mine and some parameters to control the

204
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,600
degree of dissimilarity

205
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,399
from the former slide. And the result is

206
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,720
yes like the list of frequent patterns

207
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,680
together with the position. This is an

208
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,800
example with the piece of the former

209
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,399
slide. Now I'm selecting the interval

210
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,320
viewpoint

211
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,120
uh and those parameters over there. And

212
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,720
this is an example of the output that we

213
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,000
might obtain. So we have a yellow

214
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,200
pattern that has four occurrences. and

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,760
have a look that each of these fragments

216
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,959
are at most distance one from any of the

217
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,839
rest. No, taking the Levenstein distance

218
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:41,120
function and we might have for instance

219
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,320
also this guy the purple pattern and

220
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,440
this green one which is of length four.

221
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,279
So yeah in a real case the pattern

222
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,040
structure might be complex as you see

223
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,200
because you have nested patterns you

224
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,800
have many overlapping I won't go into

225
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,160
the details on how I implemented the

226
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,800
algorithm just a brief overview uh I

227
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,920
divided in four steps the one is the

228
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,080
creation of a an initial database a a

229
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,560
vertical database it's called sometimes

230
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,279
where I just take a sliding window of

231
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,079
length minimum length the minimum length

232
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,720
selected by the user and I just create a

233
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,959
database of do all the patterns together

234
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,399
with their positions within the score.

235
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:25,839
Then in the next step I compare every

236
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,480
pattern against all the rest trying to

237
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,200
uh see if they satisfies the distance

238
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,800
constraint. No. And in that case I group

239
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,120
them together into uh what I call metric

240
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,279
patterns which are like groups of

241
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,600
fragments of music. you know at this

242
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,760
stage it's safe to deate the entries

243
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,760
that doesn't reach the minimum support

244
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,480
constraint like they don't have enough

245
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,560
occurrences to be considered frequent

246
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,720
and finally as here I still have

247
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,320
patterns of length equal to the minimum

248
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,120
length and we actually want longer

249
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,800
patterns so the last stage is

250
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,120
overlapping different patterns to form

251
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,519
longer ones

252
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,120
okay and to finish this I'm going to

253
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,000
show you some results this is the last

254
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,959
slide

255
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,720
Uh I'm actually already using this I

256
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,000
started using collaborating with these

257
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,640
research groups like seven months ago.

258
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,680
This has a a research group from

259
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,760
another university of Madrid. They got a

260
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,959
good amount of money of the European

261
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:32,320
Union to study the Italian operas. They

262
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,279
have a huge database with many features

263
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,320
for each piece and in particular they

264
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,839
are interested in the emotion that the

265
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,640
piece evoke. So here we are trying to

266
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,959
find some correlations between the

267
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,760
emotions and the pattern structure of

268
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,959
the different pieces. These two other

269
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:57,200
projects are pretty similar. The number

270
00:11:52,959 --> 00:12:00,399
two it's on a corpus of folk music from

271
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,279
a very concrete region of Europe in

272
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,600
around the Pyrenees. And the second one

273
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,720
is the

274
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,720
a database of just solos. So here we are

275
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,680
building classifiers like similar to

276
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,000
what we did in the last uh class. Here

277
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,480
I'm showing like uh the number of

278
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,240
patterns per style for the different

279
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,120
styles in this uh corpus. uh but perhaps

280
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,200
here uh we can see a cool thing of the

281
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,279
algorithm that it returns also the

282
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,440
position of the patterns not only the

283
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,920
fact that a piece contain the pattern no

284
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,480
so here I'm plotting it's called

285
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,560
coverage this variable but it's actually

286
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,040
like the

287
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,760
probability function of encountering a

288
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,360
pattern within a solo no so I normalize

289
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,000
the length of the all the solos by style

290
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,040
and the thin line is the average for the

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,519
solos we You can see for instance that

292
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,360
the concentrations of of patterns tends

293
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,800
to be at the beginning and not in the

294
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,600
end. This is intuitive because like the

295
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,519
impro improvisors usually start their

296
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,600
solos like in a more organized way

297
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,600
taking thematic material from the

298
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,800
original melody and then they start to

299
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,360
do more crazy stuff. No. Then I'm also

300
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,120
trying to build up a pattern dictionary

301
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,000
of uh in an Iris corpus. These are the

302
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,320
five most frequent patterns in the

303
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,639
subset of minor rs in the corpus that

304
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,560
I'm working on. So I don't know for a

305
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,880
performance that is interested in

306
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,920
playing this music perhaps the takeaway

307
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,519
of this is okay you might want to start

308
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,279
studying these patterns no because they

309
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:42,800
appear quite often in the in the corpus.

310
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:46,480
So better to first master them and for

311
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,279
the future with Michael

312
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,440
we want to study uh how the algorithm

313
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:54,399
performs in a nice corpus of early music

314
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,480
that he has and also we want to analyze

315
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,519
some solos of Charlie Parker who was one

316
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,000
of the most mathematical improvisers of

317
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,320
the history and also for the close

318
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,720
future I would like to see if this tool

319
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:11,279
can be helpful for plagiaris detection.

320
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,360
No, I suspect that two pieces that uh

321
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,320
are very similar share also some

322
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,320
similarities in their pattern structure.

323
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,090
And that's all. Thank you very much,

324
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,519
guys. Any questions?

325
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:27,120
[Applause]

326
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,040
>> By the way, just so you get a sense for

327
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,079
your final things, that was 12 minutes.

328
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,480
So, a tiny bit longer than what you have

329
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,480
as a maximum.

330
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,959
Cool.

331
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,639
>> If any of you are interested in a

332
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,320
particular thing of the algorithm, just

333
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,399
drop me an email and we can talk about

334
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,839
it. Okay.

335
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,360
Thank you.

336
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,199
>> So, what I want to do is I want to

337
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,639
immediately start by putting some of uh

338
00:14:53,199 --> 00:15:00,560
thoughts to work. So, uh get with a

339
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,079
partner next to you. You can um you can

340
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,680
do that if over here we need a group of

341
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,920
three or unless you want to participate

342
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,399
with a friend or or jump over there.

343
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,240
Well, jump over with uh with yeah with

344
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:16,399
uh with Jordan if you do. Um and here

345
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,880
are um six melodies. I'm going to play

346
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,800
um each one of them. I'm going to play a

347
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,720
a bunch of times also. So I'll tell you

348
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,760
which one I'm playing and you're going

349
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,000
to So and you can talk during this or

350
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:33,600
wait till just after playing. You're

351
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,930
going to tell me which melody is the um

352
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:43,680
is most or least similar to A.

353
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:47,600
[Music]

354
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,279
Okay. And this is and and

355
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,760
this is B. And I want you to know say

356
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:59,440
why

357
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:59,440
[Music]

358
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:09,680
This is C.

359
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:11,440
[Music]

360
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,460
And I'm going to play A one more time to

361
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:19,839
get it back into our heads.

362
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:23,199
[Music]

363
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,720
And now D.

364
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,759
Oh, and by the way, this isn't a right

365
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,759
there isn't a right answer one.

366
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,519
Great.

367
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,519
Now E.

368
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,570
And now A one more time before doing F.

369
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:56,639
So this is A again.

370

[Music]

371
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,519
And now F.

372
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,880
Oops, that's F and E simultaneously,

373
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,880
which is very different. Now F.

374
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,600
[Music]

375
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,520
Great. Talk amongst yourself. I want a

376
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,839
ranking from your group. So, somebody

377
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,839
write it down.

378
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,600
>> And I want to know why.

379
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,480
>> Okay, let's bring it all back together.

380
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,880
Let's bring it all all back together.

381
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:46,400
So, look at look at your look at your

382
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,640
list and we'll we'll count like normal

383
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,960
human beings. whichever one is the top

384
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,400
in your list is one, whichever one's

385
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,200
second to stuff. And we'll we'll vote by

386
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,080
fingers first off for the general

387
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,120
ranking. So when if you hold up the

388
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,760
number of fingers that um you know, if

389
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,480
it's closest, it's pulled up one finger.

390
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,440
If not to, you know, whatever. And pull

391
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,039
palm means I have no idea what that is.

392
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,039
Okay.

393
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,039
B.

394
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:25,640
Oh, B's doing pretty pretty well. Okay.

395
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,640
Not a lot of twos. A couple ones. C.

396
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,799
Okay. A little bit more variety. Hold

397
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,000
them up so other people can see also.

398
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,840
Yeah. Look around the room. It's not

399
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,840
just for me. Great. Great. Uh D.

400
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:42,120
Oh, okay. We got a variety. No. No.

401
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,120
Whatever. Great. Uh E.

402
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:48,720
Oh, that's still see some palms or

403
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,240
things. Great. And F.

404
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,640
Okay.

405
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,799
Oh, we have one one four. Good. Good.

406
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,400
Uh, what did you what you what you you

407
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,200
put it down? What do you guys Those who

408
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,840
put uh F as four, what' you put as five?

409
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,559
>> D.

410
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,039
>> B.

411
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,520
>> D.

412
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:11,120
>> D. Okay. D. Good. Good. Great. Um,

413
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:14,000
somebody who had who had uh C above B,

414
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,480
justify your answer. Who who had C above

415
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,960
B? There were a couple people. Yeah. Uh,

416
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,559
go ahead, Jake. First.

417
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,480
Yeah. Groups. Yeah.

418
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,880
>> C was basically just a transposition

419
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,840
whereas B like B changed a lot of the

420
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,120
rhythms a bit. Like B H B I think fits

421
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,840
the exact pitches a little better, but

422
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,000
or aside from a couple places where it

423
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,640
has some accidentals, but it changes the

424
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,400
rhythm quite a bit. Whereas C is just a

425
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,120
transposition. So for relative pitch

426
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,240
especially,

427
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,760
>> yeah, we waited transposition on. Okay,

428
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,440
good. Good. I'm already hearing words

429
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,880
that I that I'm liking and stuff. Great.

430
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,480
Um, somebody who had it the other way

431
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,440
around to justify your answer. Who who

432
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,559
had it the other way around?

433
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,480
Who had a bunch of people had B above C?

434
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:02,160
Yeah, John.

435
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:06,559
>> For like the kind like styling feel that

436
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:08,960
A had. Um, because are similar between A

437
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,799
and B is why we put a bit higher

438
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,200
relative C. And when you take

439
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,200
transposition into account, only part of

440
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,880
C's coming transposed. So it doesn't

441
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,240
even feel like it's like a full

442
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,000
transposition.

443
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,200
>> Great. Only part of it transpose. Yeah.

444
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah. It kind of gets back on for a bit

445
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,799
and then comes back off. Great. Uh okay.

446
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,280
Who had who had D um who had D1 or two?

447
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,679
Anybody? I can't remember.

448
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,880
Yeah. Why' you have a one or two?

449
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,120
>> Um because it basically has this. Sorry.

450
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,880
It has all of the same notes in the

451
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,039
right position or or basically. Yeah.

452
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,840
Yeah. All you have to do is remove notes

453
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,440
and then you get the same thing and I

454
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,720
think with a few exceptions but that

455
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,120
never happened in

456
00:20:52,720 --> 00:21:00,480
>> Okay, great. Who had uh D very low?

457
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,520
>> Yeah. Go ahead.

458
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,520
>> Sorry. Sorry. Can you speak a lot?

459
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,960
>> Okay.

460
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:18,080
>> Great. Um, and who had um did anybody

461
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,679
have E above um above four?

462
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,000
>> Okay,

463
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,120
we have EX3

464
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,520
and we put it there because the pattern

465
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,520
was very similar. I even though the

466
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,200
melody wasn't all that close, we figured

467
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,840
that count.

468
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,280
>> So, so when you say pattern, what the

469
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,600
rhythm the rhythmic pattern is about the

470
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,360
same? Good.

471
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,679
That's an inversion, right?

472
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,640
>> Is it an inversion? No. No. That would I

473
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,000
would I do that?

474
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,640
>> I can't, by the way, I can't remember

475
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,559
where melody I I think melody a comes

476
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:57,280
from uh here on uh book and then gives

477
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,720
there's uh some some search book and I

478
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,400
should I should have my notes better and

479
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,799
I'll try to make sure it gets annotated

480
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,720
later. Um that had three other melodies.

481
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,400
I tried this in the past and it was so

482
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,480
obvious everybody had the exact same

483
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,080
ranking. I had to agree with them, but I

484
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,120
think this is better for making some

485
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,600
arguments. Good. Who um who had F

486
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,080
anything but F? Actually, somebody who

487
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,440
gave F5. Jonathan, why would you did you

488
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,520
give F5?

489
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,600
>> Yeah. Why'd you give it five?

490
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:28,080
>> I mean, it didn't have any noticeable

491
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,720
similarity. Like at first it seemed

492
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,919
closer to like E in like it might have

493
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,320
been inversion, but then not really.

494
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,840
is also completely different or not

495
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,559
completely but like it's fairly

496
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,960
different.

497
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:48,640
>> Great. So, um I'm just going to point

498
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:50,559
and we'll get some um some uh just what

499
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,880
your ranking is. So, so say them from

500
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,320
thing. Matthew, what was your your

501
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,159
>> alphabetical order?

502
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,159
>> BCDE F. Okay, good.

503
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,760
BCDEF

504
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:10,240
>> BCE DF. Great. Great. Um, what's it?

505
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:14,000
>> Yeah, CBDF.

506
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,080
>> CBD EF. Good. Any anything that feels

507
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,559
like you're not being represented on the

508
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,280
Hannah, what's your group?

509
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:25,600
>> Um, I think I put CBD.

510
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,799
>> CBDF. CBDF. Great. Super. Now, what I

511
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,120
want you to do, we're not going to get

512
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,799
through all of the exercises today, uh,

513
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,280
but I think this is the most important

514
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:37,200
part. What I want you to do is think

515
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,960
about what ways,

516
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,480
um, start thinking. I'll give you a

517
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,880
little bit of things. What are some ways

518
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,120
you can make sure that your computer

519
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,480
system that is going to classify things

520
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:52,000
by similarity follows your intuition of

521
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,400
what is similar and not somebody else's

522
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,720
intuition for what is similar. So that's

523
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,440
going to be the main theme for the rest

524
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,919
of this that we are intelligent people.

525
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,760
We are intelligent musicians. We are uh

526
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:09,120
make these choices and yet we are making

527
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,720
differences on how far and how similar

528
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,400
they are. So in fact I'm going to blake

529
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,880
the screen and say the one the one uh

530
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,960
takeaway from today's lecture I hope and

531
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:23,200
from Kiki from all these things is that

532
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,760
there is no right answer for the

533
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,640
similarity between two melodies between

534
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:31,039
the si similarity between two pieces.

535
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,840
There may be wrong answers. I will not

536
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,559
deny that that if if somebody said that

537
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,240
uh that f was uh closer to I don't know

538
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,240
than the same thing with one note

539
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,400
changed or something I would you know

540
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,240
think that that might be wrong then your

541
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,400
problem program might be malfunctioning

542
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,679
but there isn't a right answer and a lot

543
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,440
of it the what different between good

544
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,679
answers are what we think of u as

545
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,760
important when thinking similarity there

546
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,000
is a yearly competition I think it's

547
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,120
been suspended since since co so I don't

548
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
if it's restarted but um for the

549
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,640
algorithm that can that can classify

550
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,559
songs as the most similar and here is a

551
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,679
place where I would say what are your

552
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:16,080
ground truths how do we trust that you

553
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:20,080
have gotten it right and are we just

554
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,159
trying having to recreate the views I

555
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,799
won't say biases but the views of the

556
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,720
people who organize the um the

557
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,919
conference and you know what's that

558
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:34,400
going to do for us okay so I want you

559
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:37,200
start thinking that um and I will tell

560
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,000
you what f is beforehand.

561
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,200
F is one that a lot of computers

562
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,559
programs in fact what I like went aha

563
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,440
during one of uh Kiki's uh al algorithms

564
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,360
that could F is one that a number of

565
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,880
algorithms especially older ones will

566
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,799
classify as the most similar

567
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:04,400
because what is F unlike any of the

568
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:06,400
other lines F has every single note and

569
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,000
every single rhythm if I did it right I

570
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,039
was doing it in my head. Every single

571
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,840
note and every single rhythm from A just

572
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:17,760
order didn't matter.

573
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:20,640
A is the counter set function, the

574
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,880
unordered version, the the P. Well,

575
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,520
yeah, the permutation does not matter

576
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,840
version of F

577
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,360
or F is the permutation does not matter

578
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,640
version of A. Did I get it right?

579
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,279
>> Right.

580
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,000
>> That looks right.

581
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,000
>> Looks right. Okay.

582
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,679
So, I'm going to go quickly through some

583
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,840
things I think you've probably seen

584
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,480
before. Some some ways of measuring

585
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:48,000
distance. You all learned this in some

586
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,640
point. The um uklidian distance between

587
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,279
two points. Take the square root of the

588
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,559
x terms. Take square root of the y term

589
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,200
add what difference squared plus

590
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,159
difference squared square root. Right.

591
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:06,520
Yeah. Square root of x^2 plus difference

592
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,520
between x and difference between y.

593
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,080
So anyone seen this u thing where the

594
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:17,039
distance between these two points 3

595
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:20,320
comma 2 and 7 comma 8 is 10 who's soon

596
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,480
taxi cab distance Manhattan distance uh

597
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,159
we'll go with we'll go with taxi cab

598
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,640
since not all of us have been to a

599
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:30,000
Manhattan and had the joys of taking a

600
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:34,000
taxi there and stuff what why this here

601
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,120
the distance was 10 here it's approx

602
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,279
that's not a negative sign this

603
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:42,559
approximate sign approximately 7.2.

604
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,159
Why is the distance greater here?

605
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,799
Somebody who's

606
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,559
>> triangle inequality. What's talk talk

607
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,279
English to me for a second? Talk talk

608
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,360
like you're talking to the uh your cab

609
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,640
driver and who's who you're explaining

610
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,480
to this. No, cab drivers are really

611
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,360
smart. Talk but who may not have heard

612
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,440
the time inequality. What what is

613
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,320
represented by the term Manhattan

614
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,000
distance or triang or um taxi cab

615
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,000
distance? What's the notion

616
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
intuition?

617
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,279
>> Go along the axis.

618
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,520
>> Go along the axis or that go along let's

619
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,960
let's get get more literal. Let's one of

620
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,880
the things that we science don't do so

621
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,360
well is step back into the real world.

622
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,840
What is the distance traveled? What

623
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:34,720
constrains the taxi cab from not hitting

624
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:37,679
distance of 7.2 but instead 10? Yeah,

625
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,880
>> you go straight up and down to the side.

626
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,640
>> You can only go straight up and down the

627
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,320
side. You can only go on Let's go even

628
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,440
further back. What can What in

629
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,159
Manhattan? If you don't want to get

630
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,640
arrested, you can only drive on

631
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,480
>> streets. And the streets in Manhattan

632
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,000
goal

633
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,679
>> Yeah. They're orthogonal. There are

634
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,880
these little lines. So, you are

635
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:59,120
constrained in where you can go. So if

636
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,480
there are constraints on your distance

637
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:05,679
and the most common one is you can go up

638
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,399
down left or right um can't always do

639
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,320
that in Manhattan but um because of one

640
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,080
ways but you know let's assume that we

641
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,520
have certain constraints you can be

642
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,720
brought down good I wanted to make sure

643
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:21,039
that we all have that and so that we can

644
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:23,039
start thinking about um

645
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,000
that first off that what operations are

646
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,480
allowed determines the distance metric

647
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,640
What operations are around determines

648
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,919
how far the distance are? What are some

649
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,919
operations we do in music?

650
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,159
That's the question. What what

651
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,720
operations do we allow and not allow?

652
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,559
Adam,

653
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,840
>> we can look at MIDI.

654
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,919
>> We can look at MIDI difference between

655
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,240
notes. So therefore, we can take notes

656
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:51,120
and bring them

657
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,520
higher and lower, right? We can we can

658
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,559
raise and lower notes. What are other

659
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,559
things we can do?

660
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,919
What are some some things you've ever

661
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,799
done with a piece to make it a little

662
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,919
bit different or interesting?

663
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,240
>> Yeah,

664
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,120
>> you can subdivide or combine.

665
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,399
>> You can subdivide or combine notes.

666
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,399
Maybe you can, maybe you can't, but

667
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,880
yeah, quite often you can. This context

668
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:21,279
where you can um other Yeah, other

669
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,960
>> you can change durations. Great. Super.

670
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:28,559
Super super. Um, how about this? What is

671
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,679
which of these two chords are closer to

672
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,000
the first one? The first one's going to

673
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,000
be C major

674
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:43,309
versus

675
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:43,309
[Music]

676
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,000
another little similarity problem.

677
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,240
Second one was G

678
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,159
major. The sorry the the first chord the

679
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,799
first one it was G major second one I

680
00:30:54,159 --> 00:31:01,279
went from C major to

681
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:03,360
>> C augmented great C augmented triad so

682
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,600
those are two things which one who votes

683
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,320
that from going from C major to G major

684
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,720
is closer

685
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,480
who votes that C major and C augmented

686
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,320
are closer

687
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,320
people. Okay, great. So, a lot of it has

688
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,159
to do with your thought um about, you

689
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,919
know, well, one one you're the

690
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,760
augmented, you're only changing one note

691
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,880
and you're only changing by a half step.

692
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,320
The minimum distance in our

693
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,080
Manhattanized musical world of MIDI and

694
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,640
piano keyboards, right? That is their

695
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,039
minimum distance is one half step there.

696
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,360
Not for all music in the world. Great. C

697
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,360
major to G major, you're also just

698
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,960
moving one. If you think of something

699
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,600
this way, you were moving one distance

700
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,600
in what space?

701
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,960
>> Oh, what's that word?

702
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,320
>> Circle.

703
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,240
>> In circle of fifth space, C and G are

704
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,799
about as close as you can get without

705
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,080
being the identity. C and F probably the

706
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,600
other way. Although, I don't know, maybe

707
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,519
it's a one-way circle of fifths. You

708
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,640
only go around uh one direction or

709
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,640
another. Great.

710
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,960
based on the time. I don't not going to

711
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,640
go through all these other measurements

712
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,200
of distance that people can do. Who has

713
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,240
heard of Earth Mus distance? That is the

714
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:20,399
amount of work that it takes to move one

715
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,799
mound of things over to another place

716
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,919
and um sometimes you optimizing

717
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:28,080
depending on how um how much it costs to

718
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,720
move distance and how much it costs to

719
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,760
move material. Um you can end up with

720
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,240
different results.

721
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,240
Um, I always, this was one of the charts

722
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,320
I think I showed early in the semester,

723
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,480
uh, is here's one place where Earth

724
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:48,080
mover distance might be a good use of

725
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,240
things, uh, of distances. And then, uh,

726
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,640
Levvenstein or edit distance is one that

727
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,600
was mentioned in, um, do you use it in

728
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,279
your work?

729
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,080
>> Yep. So, that's that's what you're

730
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:02,640
talking about. Um so the idea of how to

731
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:06,240
change the word Hondaai into Honda um

732
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:09,200
and uh no no international East Asian uh

733
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,399
politics uh please for a second and um

734
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,480
we'll you can think of every time okay H

735
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:18,080
and H are the same so it has a cost of

736
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,679
zero or we can delete the H and start on

737
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,720
O and we have a cost of one but we can

738
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,600
kind of find the pattern of as we change

739
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,559
we're going to insert a Y after the H

740
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,640
we're going to substitute a U for an O.

741
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,039
This should be symmetrical the other way

742
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,440
around different operations. N is the

743
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,120
same. So that's good. D is the same. So

744
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,640
it doesn't cost anything. So our cost

745
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,760
function goes here. And so we're trying

746
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,559
to find the minimum cost from going from

747
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,960
one end to another. Uh we don't have

748
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,120
time to go through all of the algorithms

749
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,640
for this but uh Levvenstein distance

750
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,799
edit distance has a lot of good um

751
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,720
qualities that makes it useful for a lot

752
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,960
of musical similarity tasks uh just so

753
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,519
that you know you can say your professor

754
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,240
at least uh put the algorithm up on the

755
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,720
head for a second. But more importantly,

756
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,119
I think a lot of times is thinking about

757
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,760
um the particular costs of things in a

758
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,839
musical spa in a musical world. So for

759
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,440
instance,

760
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:23,359
is deleting what we're trying to think

761
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,720
about two pieces, two uh melodies. Um

762
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:29,119
one of them deletes the first note.

763
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,800
What would you call the cost on that?

764
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:36,159
Maybe maybe one. But then if it doesn't

765
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,079
make up the rhythm, the total rhythm

766
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,639
later and everything from here on is

767
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,800
going to be off and it's one line within

768
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,200
a orchestral piece, that might be a

769
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:50,000
higher um cost. Maybe um some and the

770
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,800
classic debate is whether changing a

771
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,520
note is that the same or changing a

772
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,720
letter uh um in something like this. Is

773
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,960
this the same? Does this cost one or

774
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,720
does this cost? Well, one way you can

775
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,200
change a letter is you delete it and

776
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,280
then you add a new letter back with a

777
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,280
cost of two. And these are these are

778
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,560
things that come up quite a bit in

779
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,560
similarity search. Um, and just really

780
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,079
want to say that it comes up a lot in

781
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,079
music. Don't borrow your distance metric

782
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,079
from somebody else. Different ones might

783
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,520
be used for different situations. So,

784
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:29,280
the distance between dog and gate. Um,

785
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,040
well, we can substitute d for g. Um, I

786
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,960
don't know, maybe or maybe we add other

787
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,440
things, but I'm going to assert that in

788
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,880
different some situations the distance

789
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,359
might be two between dog and gut. What

790
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,400
we do is we use the substitute uh

791
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,880
closely related pet function for cost of

792
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,520
one. So dog becomes cat and then

793
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,400
translate English to Spanish might cost

794
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,200
one. And if you think about large

795
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,760
language learning models and things, you

796
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,200
might want to have functions like this.

797
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,280
And in fact, um this is not a digital

798
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,880
humanities text class, but if it were

799
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,800
and we were doing computation, we'd

800
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,520
definitely be talking about an algorithm

801
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,480
called wordtovect, which uh was one of

802
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,200
the uh earlier successful algorithms for

803
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,359
trying to predict what words are similar

804
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,760
to other words, what words are synonyms.

805
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,880
So you can create a kind of cost

806
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,200
function for uh that is for this word is

807
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:29,839
a synonym for this one that has been

808
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,520
substituted that is lower than this then

809
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,760
this sentence is different from this one

810
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,400
because um it's using a completely

811
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:40,079
different concept.

812
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:44,079
Um I'll skip that.

813
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:47,040
So when we're thinking about um these

814
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:50,240
distances and these weird things like

815
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,520
substitute dog for cat on low cost,

816
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:57,040
substitute cat for gateto at low cost.

817
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,119
What's the term that we spent a lot of

818
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,880
time, maybe even too much time if it

819
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,200
felt like at the time talking about

820
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,400
earlier in the semester that helps to

821
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,400
think about things that are not the same

822
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,400
but might be closely related to each

823
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,400
other

824
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,960
>> equivalence.

825
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,720
>> Equivalence or equivalence classes. Yes.

826
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,440
So, one of the things you might want to

827
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,839
do is define what equivalence classes it

828
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,000
could be. I mean I I think last other

829
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,480
times I've given the exact same melody

830
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,480
up an octave and everybody immediately

831
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,880
said oh that is basically the same

832
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,520
thing. So everybody was very quickly

833
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,640
putting in an O equivalence class

834
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:42,560
things. So I wanted to make sure that we

835
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:45,760
had that and um yeah and so once you

836
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,520
have these um these distances we tend to

837
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,119
go through and this is if you're in a

838
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,040
biology class you'll spend a lot of

839
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,760
computational biology a lot of time on

840
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,599
this sequence alignment uh a kind of

841
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,240
distance metric where you're trying to

842
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,280
find the minimum distance between two

843
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,640
things that you believe might represent

844
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,960
the same type of thing or you might say

845
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,280
it's innocent until proven guilty. we'll

846
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,720
first try to see if they can be changed

847
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,520
into another thing at a low cost and

848
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,720
then discard once we realize the cost

849
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,720
cannot be u minimized. Um I will say

850
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,880
that algorithms that can be

851
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,599
shortcircuited that you can prove at a

852
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,640
certain point you can't do better than

853
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:32,320
this cost will save speed up a lot of

854
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,920
your um run times because once you know

855
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:40,160
you might say um you know that there's

856
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:44,000
no way that this could be more could be

857
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,680
better than um 20% or could be yeah

858
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,160
there's no way that this could possibly

859
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,240
be better than 90%. % similar to this.

860
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,160
So, I'm going to stop looking at the

861
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,800
rest of the piece or whatever your cut

862
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:59,680
off. Um, one of the classic uh things

863
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,000
for sequence alignment is trying to find

864
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,400
uh this is Google's uh data set they

865
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,680
released at the height of Britney Spears

866
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,720
um popularity of all the number of

867
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:13,200
searches that they believed were uh

868
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,839
trying to find the top left one, Britney

869
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,599
Spears. Um, actually really really

870
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,800
impressed that that the number of

871
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,720
correct spellings um of a hard name to

872
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,200
spell uh outweighs the rest. Anyhow,

873
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,040
that's not what I'm talking and um the

874
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,520
people who are who are really really

875
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,079
good at this and like anytime I'm trying

876
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,880
to figure out a similarity sequence

877
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,200
alignment or similarity task that I

878
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,280
don't know is to look at the people who

879
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:45,839
are trying to align um base pairs in

880
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:49,760
biology or trying to align genes um so

881
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:52,000
that um because they have many many uh

882
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,160
many many options

883
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,040
Okay. So, I'm just going to keep

884
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,040
pounding this term in and as many

885
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,800
different ways I can do uh all the

886
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:05,040
things that we're just working like

887
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:08,400
Honda Britney Spears uh jeans those are

888
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,000
all strings but we work on notes and and

889
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,760
clefts and things like notes and stuff

890
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,280
but things like that. So, how do we get

891
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,800
them in? Uh so, this is great to get

892
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,079
this from two different people. Same

893
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,880
thing. We use things called hashes which

894
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,760
are very similar to uh the concept of

895
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,760
viewpoints um to the rescue. So that try

896
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,680
to convert things note hash and note we

897
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,839
might say that here our equivalence

898
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,520
class is all notes that are names with

899
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:40,000
octave and so we might hash a stream by

900
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:44,400
just joining all the hash notes for all

901
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,000
the notes in there. Um, you will find in

902
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,920
music 21 if you're working on it,

903
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,440
there's a bunch of tools for this

904
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,280
already there in music21.sarch, a module

905
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,880
that we have not talked about now and we

906
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,880
will not talk about again, but if you're

907
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,560
doing a lot of searching, it's probably

908
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,400
worth reading the um reading the uh

909
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,640
module reference for it. I think that

910
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,160
there might be a user's guide, but I

911
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,800
can't remember if I finished it or if it

912
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,720
just trails off after a few words. So we

913
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,200
might take a a string a string convert

914
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,400
it to a stream that's hard to say very

915
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,280
fast and um translate it and we might

916
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,640
have some sort of hash function that

917
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,520
tries to make everything into um into an

918
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,599
asky character.

919
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,200
Um though there's no reason that

920
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,599
everything needs to be turned into a

921
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:39,680
string like name with octave. um in a

922
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:43,720
lot of ways uh and um strings are just

923
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,720
arrays of ints

924
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,920
if you know we're talking about that the

925
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,920
um

926
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:58,240
that the you know that a is it lower no

927
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,480
lowercase a is generally represented

928
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,480
internally as anyone remember number

929
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:00,480
remember number remember number remember

930
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:00,480
number remember number remember number

931
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,680
remember number remember number remember

932
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,119
number remember number remember number

933
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,640
>> what's that

934
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:09,359
>> 96 97 or 96. I can't remember. 96. Yep.

935
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,599
In capital A. Is that one 60?

936
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,359
>> 65. Okay. So, some people some people

937
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,880
know these. I used to have them all top

938
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,680
of the head. So, all the letters you're

939
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:21,520
doing have a particular representation.

940
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,359
And mo back in the bad bad days of the

941
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,720
60s and 70s, different computers would

942
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,480
have different representations for this.

943
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,119
And then we all agreed on the same

944
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,760
representation for uh letters. And then

945
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:35,520
we remembered that there are other

946
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,680
things in the uh um other characters in

947
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,560
the world. That looks too much like an a

948
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,760
how do I do a jin or something or an

949
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,520
alpha beta things like that. And and

950
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,119
then for a while we had a big problem

951
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,240
that they weren't all converting the

952
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,520
same thing. Anyhow, degression aside,

953
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,240
maybe we'll get to the point where we

954
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,359
can start converting things besides MIDI

955
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,680
numbers and notes into something um more

956
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,680
standardized because right now the MIDI

957
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,280
numbers is basically the only

958
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,760
standardized notes, which is probably

959
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:10,560
why MIDI keeps um uh being used for a

960
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:14,640
lot of computational projects.

961
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:17,520
So the hard part is always finding out

962
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,680
what numbers we should use to represent

963
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,680
a note.

964
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,839
So if we're going to convert name with

965
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,680
octave and we want to make a string and

966
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,119
then we want to make it a number and

967
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,040
then we want to have a whole bunch of

968
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:38,160
numbers. What have we just recently seen

969
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:40,720
that looks like a tool to take a score

970
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,960
or a part or something and works like a

971
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:47,160
hash or a viewpoint that tries to

972
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,160
convert it to a bunch of numbers.

973
00:43:53,599 --> 00:44:01,359
Not asking you to think too far back

974
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:01,359
but farther back than today.

975
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,800
Yeah, I'm

976
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,560
>> getting a feature representation.

977
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,720
>> Get extracting features. Getting a

978
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:12,079
feature representation. Yeah. So feature

979
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:15,040
extraction and this kind of viewpoint

980
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:17,520
searching are very go hand inand with

981
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,680
each other. So if you're it's partially

982
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,800
why on you know once you finish up a

983
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,520
search function you're just going to

984
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,760
want to probably try to see if um AI or

985
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,520
machine learning can do it better

986
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,400
because you have everything ready to go

987
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,920
for it. But sometimes what we extract is

988
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:38,319
different from others. Um I want to give

989
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:40,880
a little bit of a caution that um uh

990
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:42,480
great uh back then course six you had to

991
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,720
do a little final a final project called

992
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,200
the UAP and we thought that making these

993
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,480
viewpoints making a hashing system for

994
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,880
music 21 for comparisons would be a nice

995
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,560
um would would be a nice senior project

996
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,240
and then we both realized that no it's

997
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,760
uh it's a lot bigger than we thought and

998
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,800
a lot more complex than we thought and

999
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,960
so it needed to be an MN And Emily Zang

1000
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,640
was great at creating this and great we

1001
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,640
did a really great Menge project and

1002
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,040
then we realized no this this really

1003
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,839
needs to be a PhD project. We did not

1004
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,640
continue on. You can work there are so

1005
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,640
many difficult parts of um hash

1006
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:25,839
algorithms because you want to think

1007
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:28,400
about things like um yeah we'll not get

1008
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:32,839
to it. um going all the way back to the

1009
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,839
beginning. Um

1010
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:40,079
how can we create a viewpoint or

1011
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:42,079
something that allows D not to be

1012
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:45,040
totally totally different for anybody

1013
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:48,560
who didn't put D as the last of all

1014
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:52,480
possible results?

1015
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:55,280
What kinds of hash what kinds of numbers

1016
00:45:52,480 --> 00:46:00,400
would we need to represent a piece on to

1017
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:03,839
make D not the worst

1018
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,720
and to really make sure that F isn't the

1019
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:08,800
best. So that's going to be our last

1020
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,040
five six minutes of class. I want you to

1021
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,800
talk five minutes of y'all talking with

1022
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:17,280
each other and five minutes of y'all

1023
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,800
talk and talking to me. So what kinds of

1024
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,920
what kinds of feature extractions? What

1025
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,599
kind of hash function? What kind of

1026
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,800
viewpoints? These are all slightly

1027
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,560
different concepts, but they're all in

1028
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:29,280
the same area. What kinds of equivalence

1029
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:31,280
classes will you need in order to make

1030
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,160
this happen?

1031
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,280
Go ahead.

1032
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,520
Okay. I hear I hear words um continuing

1033
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,920
but but less frequently. Let's talk

1034
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,640
about what are some of the ways that um

1035
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:48,480
that people thought to create a strategy

1036
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:51,480
that doesn't make D and F about the

1037
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,480
same.

1038
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,359
>> Yeah. Go ahead.

1039
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,119
>> Look at the sequence of like local

1040
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,440
maxima and minima.

1041
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,640
>> Local maxima and minima. Okay. I think I

1042
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,880
know what you talk about, but let's give

1043
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,800
me a little example. What um let's talk

1044
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,280
about A. What do you what do you

1045
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,200
>> So you could maybe argue that the C is

1046
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,560
the local minimum and then the F is

1047
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,560
higher than both of its neighbors. So

1048
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,720
it's a maximum and then the D is a

1049
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:17,200
minimum. The E is a maximum and then the

1050
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:21,040
D and C after that are not really

1051
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,319
anything until you hit the A on the 16th

1052
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,079
note.

1053
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:26,319
>> Cool. So yeah, we're just looking at

1054
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,800
every time the direction changes of the

1055
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:34,720
pitches. Great. And compare that. So

1056
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:38,480
beginning A has D F D E here we have D F

1057
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:40,960
D tiny bit different D F but then going

1058
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,079
down to a little bit different but it's

1059
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:47,760
at least giving some numbers we have um

1060
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:50,160
yeah does always the question is does

1061
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,800
your current streak end when you hit a

1062
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,359
rest or not and maybe it depends on how

1063
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,720
long the rest is. So good. Other other

1064
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,200
strategies?

1065
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,640
>> Adam,

1066
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,000
>> I would look at where offsets are the

1067
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,960
same and then check if their notes are

1068
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,520
the same or not.

1069
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,520
>> Great. So, we're gonna look at offsets

1070
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,319
that are the same and see if notes are

1071
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:11,200
the same or not. That works really well.

1072
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:13,760
And what I'd love to do if if this were

1073
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,079
um what do you call the the generalized

1074
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,079
adversarial problem set, the GAN problem

1075
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,280
set, where one one team has to solve the

1076
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:22,160
problem, the other team has to keep

1077
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,319
giving them things that break that. Uh,

1078
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,760
and I think it was a great idea and I

1079
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:30,880
think it would work in general, but I

1080
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:34,160
could generate something like um where

1081
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,800
all I insert is let's insert a 64th rest

1082
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,680
at the beginning and then put all random

1083
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,920
notes and you're going to end up with

1084
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,599
and then maybe we'll put one note that's

1085
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,079
the same at the end and you could end up

1086
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:50,400
with 100% of the notes on the same

1087
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,800
offset are the same. Uh I think you I

1088
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,680
think we we would really work in the

1089
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,440
real world but but we might want to

1090
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,240
always think about something like that

1091
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,119
too. Great great idea John then

1092
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,200
>> ours kind of builds up on Adam. So

1093
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,640
>> you kind of start kind of builds up on

1094
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,119
what Adam was saying.

1095
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:11,280
>> Um but first you like take a look at the

1096
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,599
notes and kind like kind of do like a

1097
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,839
set kind of like crossover between like

1098
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,000
a set of D's and A notes and then like A

1099
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:19,920
and S notes. So both those would still

1100
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,319
like show up like relatively high and

1101
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,319
then like compare the offsets which we

1102
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:26,240
want to like take half of it but still

1103
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:26,960
keep D relatively high.

1104
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,960
>> Okay.

1105
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,559
>> Super. When we're talking about offsets,

1106
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,160
are we talking about um what kind of

1107
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,680
offsets

1108
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,440
>> like um where in the guess like within

1109
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,880
the two measures?

1110
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,359
>> Great. Yeah. Where in the two measures

1111
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,440
where in the measure um we sometimes

1112
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:45,440
want to do global offset from the

1113
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,880
beginning of the measure, but then you

1114
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:51,839
can't identify similar phrases or all it

1115
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,440
takes is put a repeat, put the first

1116
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,960
four measures, repeat it once and

1117
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,720
suddenly the whole rest of the piece is

1118
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,720
different. So yeah, that's great.

1119
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,480
also similar but a little duration based

1120
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,079
I guess like if you just start at time=

1121
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,760
0 and go all the way through the piece

1122
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,119
like anytime the two pieces have the

1123
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,280
same pitch if you score so like the F

1124
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,599
that they both have on beat two would be

1125
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,920
like a quarter point because

1126
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,240
>> the F the F that they both have on beat

1127
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,000
two would be a quarter point because

1128
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,400
>> shared duration is only for that 16th

1129
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,200
note.

1130
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,480
>> Gotcha. So we look at shared.

1131
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,119
Great. I like that a lot. Did anybody

1132
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,359
try to come up with equivalence? Yeah.

1133
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,880
Yeah. The contour ends up being a kind

1134
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,640
of a new equivalence class that we

1135
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,520
hadn't talked about which kind of works

1136
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:39,440
out in thinking that everything that

1137
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,400
doesn't change directions is a kind of

1138
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:45,440
passing tone even though not in the

1139
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:48,400
proper music theory term and so can kind

1140
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,800
of be ignored.

1141
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,640
By the way, I the one I use quite often

1142
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,880
is I'm just going to look on down beats

1143
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,800
or strong or on beats and ignore

1144
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,520
everything else. Um, and that would

1145
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,520
works pretty well for a lot of a lot of

1146
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,520
things.
