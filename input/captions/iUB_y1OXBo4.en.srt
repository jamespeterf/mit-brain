1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,759
So the first thing I I promised to do

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,240
today was to do the last problem on the

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,080
first problem set with you all. And so

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,519
for context, this was like pretty

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,560
difficult problem. Um and a lot of

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,240
people didn't get it fully right or or

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,679
made a mistake. And actually even the

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,079
people who did get it right tended to

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,520
write something that was pretty long and

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,040
complicated. Um so so I spent a while

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,559
thinking about it. I think I could have

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,719
set up the problem with a little more

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,239
direction. Um but anyway, but I will

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,239
explain uh explain it to everybody and

15
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,239
um and try to say sort of what were the

16
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,120
issues and what like what's what's what

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,520
do you need to know to do it cleanly.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,800
Okay. So the set the the the the

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,960
background of this problem is that we

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,399
had done a bunch of stuff in class about

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,600
lines in the plane say in FQ2 and the

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,159
problem was to try to do something

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,080
similar for lines in FQ3 but it is a

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,600
little more complicated. So let me first

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,600
remind everybody what we did for lines

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,940
in FQ2 and then we'll go up to three

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,299
dimensions.

28
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,299
[Applause]

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay. So

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,000
general setup.

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,200
Okay. So first of all if we have a

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,720
function on fqd

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:37,920
then fnot will be the constant part.

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:42,159
So fnot of x is 1 / q to the d some y

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,439
and fq to the d of f of y. And then f

36
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,840
subh f high will be the rest of it. So f

37
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,840
is f not.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,640
Okay. Um so first we studied lines in

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,280
fq2 and this is just going to be a recap

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,280
of what we did in class.

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:07,360
So we noticed um so let's say that l1

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,319
and l2 are are lines or characteristic

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:16,400
function of lines. Um okay so there are

44
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:18,400
two cases. If L1 and L2 are parallel

45
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,640
um then you can easily see that their

46
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,040
inner product is zero. Parallel means

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,040
they don't intersect.

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,239
So you get this.

49
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,920
Okay. And you could also look at the

50
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,080
high part and if you look at the high

51
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,879
part it will be negative. The inner

52
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:40,760
product will be negative. L1H L2 H will

53
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,760
be negative.

54
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,160
It's easy to compute but let me there's

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:50,400
something I could say out loud. Um uh so

56
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:56,560
one one would one always has that fg

57
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,000
is f gn plus fi g high.

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,640
You can see that from the fora

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,440
representation of these things. So in

60
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,159
this case l1 l the inner product of l1

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,599
and l2 is zero.

62
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,920
Ln l1 kn and l2 kn are both positive. So

63
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,519
their inner product is positive. So for

64
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,560
this all to fit together this inner

65
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,319
product should be negative.

66
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,800
Okay. So that's what happens if they're

67
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,239
parallel. Now at the time that felt

68
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,760
parallel felt like sort of a special

69
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,040
case. Two lines are usually not

70
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,800
parallel. Once in a while they're

71
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,920
parallel. So maybe the more important

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:34,879
case is if they're not parallel.

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,319
L1 and L2 are not parallel.

74
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,680
Okay. So if they're not parallel then

75
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:43,440
they intersect and therefore the sum L1

76
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:47,799
of X L2 of X is one.

77
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,799
But if you take the high part

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,400
L1H L2H you get zero. So the high parts

79
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,560
are orthogonal.

80
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,280
Okay. And we discussed a couple ways of

81
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,600
seeing this. Um so one way to see it

82
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,879
is based on the fora transform.

83
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:11,280
[Applause]

84
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:16,720
So if you take L hat of C its norm is Q

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:19,359
times characteristic function of L perp

86
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,600
and so in particular

87
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,199
the support

88
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:30,400
of L1 hat intersected with the support

89
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:34,960
of L2 hat is L1 perp intersected with L2

90
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:38,240
perp which is just the origin. if the

91
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,960
lines are in different directions.

92
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,080
So this is all under L1 and L2 are not

93
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,240
parallel. L1 and L2 are not parallel. L1

94
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,040
hat and L2 hat also are not parallel and

95
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,880
they intersect only at the origin.

96
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,600
Okay. And then by looking at the high

97
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,120
part we leave out the origin. So there's

98
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,080
nothing left where they intersect and

99
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,400
that gives us the orthogonal out.

100
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay. So once we had this we used it to

101
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:08,880
prove a proposition

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,479
that said if f is the sum over some set

103
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,400
of lines of l

104
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:20,240
then

105
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:25,680
f high l2 squared is bounded by the sum

106
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:28,479
over the lines of l high or not high

107
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,039
l2 squared which then you could work out

108
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:36,120
easily as bounded by the number of lines

109
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,120
times Q. This is almost an equality.

110
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,360
Okay.

111
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,280
Um so this was really the key thing and

112
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,600
this came from orthogonality. You can

113
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,320
think of it as taking this sum and

114
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:56,479
expanding it out. So this is the sum L1

115
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:00,160
and L2 in our set of lines of the sum

116
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,240
L1H L2 H.

117
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,240
And for each of these we plugged in

118
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,240
that.

119
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,800
Okay. So now let's go to three

120
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,199
dimensions. See what's the same and

121
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,039
what's different and and most

122
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,600
importantly what should be the analog of

123
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,939
this proposition.

124
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,939
[Applause]

125
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,280
Okay, so lines in FQ3.

126
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,440
Okay, so they could still be parallel or

127
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,000
not parallel. So if L1 and L2 are

128
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,919
parallel,

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,400
um then everything is still true.

130
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,800
They're parallel, then

131
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,840
this is zero. And if we wanted to take

132
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,000
the high part,

133
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,800
it would be negative.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,280
Just the same as before. Okay. What if

135
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,280
they're not parallel?

136
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,319
Okay. If they're not parallel, there are

137
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,800
still two possibilities. They could

138
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,680
intersect each other or they could not

139
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,639
intersect each other.

140
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,599
So I guess there are sort of sub cases.

141
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,680
If they intersect

142
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:25,039
um then the sum on x l1 l2 would be one

143
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,360
intersect at one point.

144
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,319
Okay, that looks like before and we

145
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,319
could take the high part

146
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,840
um but the high part isn't zero.

147
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,840
So this is an important thing that's

148
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,840
different.

149
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,599
So one one common mistake was not to do

150
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,280
this computation carefully and just

151
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,199
assume it should be zero like it was in

152
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,599
two dimensions.

153
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,599
But it's not

154
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,520
um there's not that much difference

155
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,440
between one and 1 - 1 over Q. So it's

156
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,960
not clear that we're accomplishing a

157
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,960
whole lot by focusing on the high part.

158
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,560
Yeah.

159
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,960
Um okay. Now we so to see this we could

160
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,360
do this computation. It's elementary but

161
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,599
it's a little bit tedious.

162
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,280
Um but let me see if I could say

163
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,280
something conceptual. Um

164
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,080
so the the reason that this happened

165
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,879
here is that the two high parts are

166
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,399
independent of each other as functions.

167
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,440
That's like a high a highbrow way of

168
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,919
saying what's going on. um and um that's

169
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,959
not true anymore. If you have two lines

170
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,880
that intersect in three space, um

171
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,120
they're not is not independent of each

172
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,279
other. So if you know that you're in the

173
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,880
first line, then you're much more likely

174
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,600
to be in the second line than if you

175
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,600
were just a random point.

176
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Okay, so you can I don't know if that's

177
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,480
helpful, but you you could also just

178
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,440
check that

179
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,440
that's how it goes.

180
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,519
Um, okay. They could also not intersect.

181
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,200
If they don't intersect, then everything

182
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,880
is the same as the parallel case

183
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,440
actually. So the that's going to be zero

184
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,040
and the sum of the high parts in a

185
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,800
product the high parts will be negative.

186
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,240
If you do it carefully, it's negative 1

187
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,240
over Q. Same thing would be true here.

188
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,279
Okay. So, uh, another direction that

189
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,440
this suggested to some people is that we

190
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,920
ought to try to think how many pairs of

191
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,480
lines intersect as opposed to the pairs

192
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,880
of lines that don't intersect.

193
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,560
And that is a totally reasonable way of

194
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,800
thinking about this from the beginning.

195
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,680
But it's not ob not obvious how to

196
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,000
figure that out. Um it is possible for

197
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,000
every pair of lines to intersect and

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,080
there are there are two significant ways

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,440
that that could happen. One way is you

200
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,040
could take all the lines through the

201
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,720
origin. You just pick a point and take

202
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,480
all the lines through that point. Then

203
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,120
every pair of lines will intersect at

204
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,440
that point. Have like a porcupine shape.

205
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,760
A second way that almost all the lines

206
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,680
could intersect is to choose them all in

207
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,360
a plane. So if you fix a plane and then

208
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,200
you choose lines in the plane, a few of

209
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,480
them might be parallel, but almost every

210
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,480
pair of lines in the plane will

211
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,480
intersect.

212
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,760
Um

213
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,920
anyway, so so people try to explore this

214
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,920
a little bit, but it's not so clear how

215
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:47,880
to uh put a bound how about how many how

216
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,880
many pairs will intersect.

217
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:55,279
Okay. So then another thought is that

218
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,160
instead of instead of try focusing

219
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,680
on this we should focus we should look

220
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,160
at the for transform and just sort of

221
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,680
see what the for transform tells us. So

222
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,279
the for transform does have a nice

223
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,519
description in any dimension like you

224
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,959
did on the first part of the problem set

225
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,720
and it it tells us something.

226
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,800
Okay. So let's think about the forier

227
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,760
transform

228
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,760
for point of view.

229
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,680
Okay. So if we take the 4A transform of

230
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,160
our line and look at its absolute value,

231
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,880
it will be Q times the characteristic

232
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,959
function of L perp.

233
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:37,440
But notice, so the L is still a line,

234
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:42,040
but since we're in in three dimensions,

235
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,040
L perp is two dimension.

236
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:51,279
Okay. So then if we were to take look at

237
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:54,560
the so if L1 and L2 are not parallel

238
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:58,560
not parallel I if I look at the support

239
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,880
of L1 hat intersected with the support

240
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,640
of L2 hat

241
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,279
well that's L1 perp intersected with L2

242
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,200
perp

243
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,120
so I have a two plane and I'm

244
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,600
intersecting it with a different two

245
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,600
plane and that will make a line

246
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,959
a line.

247
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,519
Okay, so a third common mistake was to

248
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,399
not do this so carefully and think that

249
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,760
this intersection was just zero. And if

250
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,040
the intersection was just zero, when you

251
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,279
take the high part, you would get rid of

252
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,920
the zero and that would show that L1 and

253
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,760
L2 were orthogonal, which is not

254
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,959
actually the L1 hat and L2 hat were

255
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,959
orthogonal, which is not actually the

256
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,959
case.

257
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,839
Okay.

258
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,560
Okay. Cool.

259
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,160
All right. So, to prove some kind of a

260
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,360
estimate about how these lines

261
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,360
intersect, we're going to try to combine

262
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,519
um this information and this

263
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,279
information. So, if they're parallel,

264
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,320
they actually are orthogonal, which is

265
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,519
very good. If they're not parallel, um

266
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,079
they're not fully orthogonal. But the

267
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,839
forier transform of the intersection of

268
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,200
for transforms is kind of small and

269
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,120
special. We'll try to use that.

270
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,240
Okay.

271
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,680
Um so here's the analogous proposition

272
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,560
and I think it would have been helpful

273
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,279
if I had stated this in the problem set.

274
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,920
Um okay. So here's how how it goes. So

275
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,920
if L is a set of lines in three

276
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,920
dimensions

277
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,920
and F Q3

278
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,880
um um and F

279
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,760
is the sum

280
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,839
lines

281
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,680
then

282
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,839
um

283
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,040
F L2 squared is bounded by so what we

284
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,959
had before was something like

285
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,639
orthogonality

286
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:04,160
um

287
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:09,040
some L and L of F L or this is with the

288
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,440
high part the high part L2 and that's

289
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,720
not true anymore but it is true if we

290
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,720
put an extra factor of Q.

291
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:24,079
Okay. Um and so then that is around um

292
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,680
the number of lines times each one of

293
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,040
these is around Q and there's another

294
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,040
factor of Q which is around there.

295
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,399
Okay.

296
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,959
So if you compare these this is like an

297
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,720
orthogonality proposition. This is

298
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,519
clearly much weaker than orthogonality

299
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,160
because we have a big factor here.

300
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,000
uh nevertheless it's stronger than

301
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,000
nothing. Even though there's a big

302
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,120
factor here, this proposition has some

303
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,120
meaningful information in it.

304
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,760
Okay. So, let me explain how to prove

305
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,560
this proposition. Um and then we'll

306
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,399
digest it and and say argue that that it

307
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,480
does tell us something interesting even

308
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,600
though it's a lot weaker in some sense

309
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,600
than the two dimensional proposition.

310
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,110
Okay. How do we prove this?

311
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,110
[Applause]

312
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,760
All right.

313
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,760
Um,

314
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,959
so

315
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,839
for parallel lines, we have a really

316
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,600
good information. So let's first think

317
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,120
about all the lines in a given direction

318
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,480
and add those up. And then after that,

319
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:44,320
we'll add up the different directions.

320
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:48,560
So we'll label the directions by W. So W

321
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:53,360
will be a one-dimensional subspace

322
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:56,959
direction and then LW will be the lines

323
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,959
in our set of lines that are parallel to

324
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,959
W.

325
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:08,480
Okay. And we can also make an FW. That's

326
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:10,320
the sum over the lines in LW of L. So F

327
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,279
itself is the sum over the different

328
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,279
directions of FW.

329
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:23,680
Okay, so the first thing that we will do

330
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,519
is um prove some estimates about FW.

331
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,279
Um and this part really is not that

332
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,519
difficult and we're adding up functions

333
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:34,160
with disjoint supports. So it's not that

334
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,800
complicated what happens. Um, okay.

335
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,320
So, FW

336
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:44,480
L2

337
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:47,839
is the size of W sorry the size of uh LW

338
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:52,120
* Q.

339
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,120
Why is that? We're we're

340
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:04,880
because the Okay. So proof

341
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:07,199
uh so the sum f w^2 is the sum lw

342
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,120
sum on x

343
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,360
l of x

344
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,959
squared.

345
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,120
But these lines are parallel. They're

346
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,640
disjoint from each other. So there's

347
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,280
only at any given x only one of them is

348
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,600
making an appearance.

349
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:30,520
So this is some l

350
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,520
sub x l of x squ.

351
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,760
Okay. And then that's the right hand.

352
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,320
[Applause]

353
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,280
Okay. And if you, it's not clear yet why

354
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,960
we would want to look at the high

355
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,679
frequency part, but if we did, it

356
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:51,919
wouldn't change much. So FW high L2 is

357
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:54,160
less than FWL2.

358
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,799
And so the proof is that this is this is

359
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,799
true for any function.

360
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:06,559
We have have it over over there. Um

361
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:13,360
for any function g2

362
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:18,200
is always g l2 2 plus g high l2 squ. So

363
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,200
it's at least as big as g high2.

364
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,840
Okay. So you can do it with the with

365
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,000
furry transform. You you could also do

366
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,559
it by hand.

367
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,679
That's a it's

368
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:34,000
call it an exercise.

369
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,039
Okay.

370
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,799
Now um the more tricky and interesting

371
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,679
point is what happens when we add

372
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,799
together the different W

373
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:50,120
and when we do that the way their fora

374
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,120
transforms behave will come into play.

375
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,919
All right.

376
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,240
So I guess that this is lema three but

377
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,160
I'm going to put a star because this is

378
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,559
the important lema. This is where the

379
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,880
interesting stuff is happening.

380
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:16,240
Okay. Important lema says that f L2

381
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:19,559
is bounded by Q + 1 times the sum on W

382
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,559
of FWL2.

383
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:28,120
Okay, here's the proof. Oh, and sorry.

384
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,120
And now I need to put high everywhere.

385
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:41,360
All right. So,

386
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:48,520
f high l 2 is by planer. It's the sum on

387
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:48,520
the nonzero c fhat of c squ.

388
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,000
So remember that f knot is the zero

389
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,679
frequency part of f. f high as all the

390
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,679
other frequencies in F. And so this is

391
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,679
planer.

392
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,679
Oh, okay. And I guess because of the

393
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,960
finite field normalization that I always

394
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,120
have trouble remembering, there should

395
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,120
be this.

396
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:21,120
Okay. Now f is the sum of fw.

397
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:28,400
This is 1 / q cubed times the sum in the

398
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:31,400
nonzero c sum on w of fw hat of c^

399
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,400
squ.

400
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,240
Okay.

401
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,360
Now in two dimensions we could have done

402
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,120
this and gotten to this point and then

403
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,400
we would have been very happy because

404
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,159
the different FW hats have different

405
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,039
supports. They're supported on on

406
00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:00,080
different lines through the origin. So

407
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,200
we would have orthogonality.

408
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,559
So the way it would the way it would

409
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,320
have worked in two dimensions is that

410
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:09,520
for any particular C there is only one w

411
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:14,280
which is non zero in this sum and so we

412
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,280
could take this square in inside.

413
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:22,960
Okay but that's not true anymore. So fw

414
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:26,240
hat is supported on wp

415
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,799
and in any in any uh in any given

416
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,039
direction any given any given c there

417
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,000
are many different two planes that

418
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,559
contain that c.

419
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,520
So let's write that down.

420
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:46,159
So we're going to note

421
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:53,440
that the support of FW hat is WRP

422
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:57,919
and um so for any C um

423
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:03,919
uh the um FW

424
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:08,000
the the set of W so that f W of C is not

425
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:12,919
zero is contained in the set of W. So

426
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,919
the W is in C per

427
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,000
yeah

428
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,880
>> did the we we still need the high part

429
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,880
right on the

430
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,400
on the F hat.

431
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,559
>> Yeah. So the question is I think the

432
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,480
question is so on the left hand side I

433
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,200
put the high part of F and the question

434
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,320
is do we need the high part here? Is

435
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,360
that the question?

436
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,880
>> Zero. No. Um so we so we don't need that

437
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,280
but but I should have said it uh

438
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,159
clearer. So let's all remember that if

439
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:47,360
you take the high part of f hat c what

440
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:50,559
you get is fhat of c is non zero and

441
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:55,000
zero if c is zero.

442
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,000
So this is this is f fihat.

443
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:09,000
Okay. So for any given frequency C, I

444
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:09,000
only need to include the W's in CP.

445
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,799
So actually I can write

446
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,280
this

447
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,919
and there aren't as many there. There's

448
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,159
more than one of them, but there is a

449
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:27,360
non-trivial bound on how many are terms

450
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:31,120
are in this sum. So the number of W

451
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,960
in C perp so this is a two plane we're

452
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,720
talking about how many lines through the

453
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,919
origin there are in this two plane

454
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,919
that's Q + one

455
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,320
so for so there are something like Q ^2

456
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,159
different W in total but for any given C

457
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,720
we're only including Q of them in the

458
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,960
sum here that's not as good as

459
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,960
orthogonal ity, but it actually is

460
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,720
helpful information.

461
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,280
And the way we can exploit that

462
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,960
information is by Koshy Schwarzing this.

463
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,240
So I'm going to think of this as the sum

464
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,000
of this thing times 1. Of course, I

465
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,720
didn't change anything. And now I can

466
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,720
apply Koshy Schwarz

467
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:19,440
one over Q cubed sum over the nonzero C.

468
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,799
Okay, the first term will be

469
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:28,480
some W in C per

470
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:32,559
FAT of W of C norm squared

471
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:36,919
and the second half will be some W and C

472
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,919
per of 1 2

473
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:47,200
okay and this is Q + one

474
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:50,240
so we bring that out to the front. And

475
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,559
after that, what we have left is a sum

476
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:58,480
that just involves each FW one at a

477
00:24:52,559 --> 00:25:03,360
time. So it's Q + 1 1 over Q cubed sum

478
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:05,039
on the nonzero C. Um

479
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:10,080
actually I could put well I'll put the

480
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:14,120
sum on W here. F WW hat C^ squ but I can

481
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,120
switch the order of these sums.

482
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:24,559
And now if I plan your back I have Q +

483
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:28,279
one times the sum on W FW high L2.

484
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,279
And that's the statement.

485
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,919
Okay. Any questions or comments?

486
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,520
In that case maybe I have a question for

487
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,520
you.

488
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,840
In this proof, what was the purpose of

489
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:55,799
taking out the zero frequency? What did

490
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,799
we gain by doing that?

491
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,679
>> Yeah,

492
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,159
>> the zero frequency

493
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:09,440
equals 0 every

494
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:11,919
W contains equals Z. So the bound would

495
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,880
be Q.

496
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:18,320
>> Good. Good. So the comment is that C

497
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,760
equals 0 is special because and when C

498
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:26,799
is zero every W per goes through zero.

499
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:30,480
So um every every there so there are Q2

500
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:32,960
different W's and every one of them has

501
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,440
a contribution at zero. So if we wanted

502
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,200
to do Koshy Schwarz we would have Q ^

503
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,919
squ terms here. Um but at every other C

504
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,559
we have only Q W per going through it

505
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,159
and so we have to pay only Q over here.

506
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,720
That's what's different about zero and

507
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:52,320
not zero.

508
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,039
Yeah. Good.

509
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,400
Okay. Um so now the proof of the

510
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,440
proposition over there is just

511
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,400
assembling these lemas. So the

512
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,520
proposition says that I I want to bound

513
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,799
the L2 norm of f high.

514
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,279
How do I do it? Uh, lamma 3 says the L2

515
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,080
norm of fi is bounded by q + one times

516
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,240
the sum on w of those. And llamas one

517
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,320
and lamas 2 tells me how big each one of

518
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,840
these is.

519
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,880
If you put that all together, you get

520
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,880
you get proposition two.

521
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Okay.

522
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,120
Okay. Um,

523
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,880
great. Okay. So, now let me erase this a

524
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,279
little bit and let's think about what

525
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:47,080
what proposition two tells us about

526
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,080
lines in free space.

527
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,799
Okay.

528
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,600
Um, so actually let's let's uh first

529
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:14,640
review what proposition one tells us

530
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:18,640
about lines in the plane.

531
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:22,240
So f is a sum of lines.

532
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:27,840
fnot is always the number of lines

533
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:29,600
divided by q. And so f L2 squared is

534
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,559
works out to be the number of lines

535
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,679
squared. It's not hard to check.

536
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:41,360
And proposition one,

537
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:43,919
it tells us that fi L2 is bounded by the

538
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,880
number of lines times Q. So if you put

539
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,919
these together, you see that if the

540
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:54,919
number of lines is much bigger than Q,

541
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,919
then F is mostly constant.

542
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,760
So then uh the L2 norm of f_subi is much

543
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,320
smaller than the L2 norm of the constant

544
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,240
part. The sum of lines looks almost

545
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,399
constant with some small perturbations.

546
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,640
Okay. What's the analog of that in three

547
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:16,520
dimensions?

548
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,520
Lines in FQ3.

549
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,480
Okay. So in three dimensions fnot is the

550
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:29,679
number of lines over q ^2 because each

551
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,279
line occupies a 1 over q ^2 fraction of

552
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,440
space.

553
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:37,279
And so then you can compute the l2 norm

554
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:40,240
of f^ 2. It's not difficult. It's number

555
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:44,880
of lines squared over q.

556
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:48,159
And on the other hand we know that fi l2

557
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,919
is at most the number of lines times q

558
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,559
^2.

559
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,159
You can put these together. If the

560
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,880
number of lines is large enough, then

561
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,480
this is way bigger than this.

562
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,919
If you do a little bit of algebra, you

563
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,720
see that if the number of lines is much

564
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,640
larger than Q cubed,

565
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,520
then the high frequency part is much

566
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,720
smaller than the constant part. So if

567
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,320
you add up more than q cubed lines in

568
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,000
three-dimensional space, you'll get

569
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,200
something that's mostly constant with

570
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,200
some small perturbations.

571
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:29,200
Okay. Now these are both the correct

572
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,279
thresholds for this behavior. Why? So in

573
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,799
two dimensions suppose I add up less

574
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:37,840
than Q lines. Say Q over2 lines. Well

575
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,279
they only fill half of space. So there's

576
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,360
no way that that thing is going to look

577
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,960
constant. So this will certainly not be

578
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,960
true with Q over two lines.

579
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,480
All right. Now in three dimensions

580
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,440
suppose I add up less than Q cubed lines

581
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,960
maybe half of Q cubed lines.

582
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,080
All right. Now this is a trickier

583
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,080
wicket. It depends which lines I pick.

584
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,720
If you were to pick half of Q cubed

585
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,600
lines randomly and add them up it would

586
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,000
be quite close to constant.

587
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,080
But if you pick them cleverly you can

588
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,240
make it not look like a constant. And

589
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,320
here's how to do it.

590
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,799
Um

591
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,799
so example

592
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:25,440
of 12 q cubed lines

593
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,679
in fq cubed.

594
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:34,760
Okay, here's what I'm going to do. I'm

595
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:34,760
gonna pick one half Q aine two planes

596
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:46,880
uh capital PJ

597
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:48,799
and then um in each capital PJ

598
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,200
I pick

599
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,200
all the lines

600
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,880
which is basically Q^2 lines.

601
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,159
So two dimensional plane has about Q ^2

602
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,679
lines in it. Q2 + Q.

603
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,320
Okay. So you put this all together.

604
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:15,039
That's about half of Q cubed lines. Um

605
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,760
now f which is the sum l and l is

606
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:20,480
supported

607
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,600
on the union of the pj

608
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:28,880
and the size of the union of the pj is

609
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:32,080
uh is clearly at most half of the space.

610
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:36,080
So the size of the union of PJ is at

611
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:39,279
most 12 Q the number of J times Q ^2

612
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,039
number of points per plane 12 Q cubed.

613
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,519
So this thing is only supported on about

614
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:47,240
half of space. There's no way that it's

615
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,240
approximately constant.

616
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,640
Cool.

617
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,039
Okay. So in a certain sense this is the

618
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,960
right threshold. Uh although you could

619
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,960
also imagine asking some more refined

620
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,960
questions.

621
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,000
Okay, I guess looking back at the

622
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,159
homework, I mentioned a few a few things

623
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,880
that people tried that didn't work. And

624
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,440
um I think the most common thing that

625
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,559
people had a tricky time finding was

626
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,240
that they should first group the lines

627
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:33,120
in by their direction and have these FWS

628
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,880
and then group the FWS together to make

629
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,559
F.

630
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,640
Yeah. Um so I think I could have done a

631
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,919
better job giving direction to look in

632
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,399
that look that way. Look in that

633
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,640
direction. Uh but in hindsight, why was

634
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,559
that a good idea?

635
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,799
Um

636
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,399
there's a saying that I like about

637
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,320
trying to learn stuff or trying to

638
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:56,799
figure stuff out that I learned from a

639
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,440
Taichi teacher. Uh they said do do

640
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:02,240
what's easy first.

641
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,919
So if you are you're trying to for in

642
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,360
math for example add up a whole lot of

643
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,360
things and understand what the sum is

644
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,119
like. If there are some pieces that you

645
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,280
can add up and you know what those are

646
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,879
like it's usually a good idea to do that

647
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,359
first.

648
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,119
Um and uh you know adding up parallel

649
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,720
lines is fairly easy to understand and

650
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,399
so

651
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,760
it won't always help but sometimes it's

652
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,760
helpful to do what's easy first

653
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,480
actually same thing happens in Fubini

654
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,399
when I teach analysis at various levels

655
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,679
when is it a good idea to do Fubini to

656
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,520
switch the order of integration or

657
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,599
switch the order of summation you want

658
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,599
to put the sum that you do first to be

659
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,480
the easy one that's almost always the

660
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,480
right way to organize

661
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,280
Okay. So that was the recap of the

662
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,280
homework.

663
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:59,760
Okay. Um cool. So now the now we come to

664
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,720
the the main the main topic of the day

665
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,560
uh which is uh doing some some

666
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,280
projection theory in uklidian space and

667
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,119
thinking about how projections ma makes

668
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,280
functions smoother. So if you take a

669
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,920
function in R to the D and you project

670
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,040
it onto something lower dimensional

671
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,560
um well if you just pick one lower

672
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,800
dimensional projection it might not be

673
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,800
very nice but if you look at all the

674
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,280
lower dimensional projections most of

675
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,280
them will be smoother and we're going to

676
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,960
investigate that phenomenon. And I hope

677
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:34,040
you'll see that it's very parallel to

678
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,040
the large civ theory from number three.

679
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,090
[Applause]

680
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,480
All right, projections

681
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,480
and smoothing.

682
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,920
All right, so here's our setup. Uh so f

683
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:24,359
is now a function on r to the d

684
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,359
and v is going to be a subspace.

685
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,560
Okay. And recall but by by the

686
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:35,520
projection of f what I mean is the

687
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:40,040
integral over var f of y + z

688
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,040
d volume of z.

689
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,280
So this is a map from functions on R to

690
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,839
the D to functions on V.

691
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,880
Um okay

692
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,400
u and I'm going to mostly focus

693
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,640
everything works for all the dimensions

694
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,079
but for ease of notation whatever I'm

695
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,880
going to mostly focus on projecting to

696
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,800
onedimensional subspaces. So theta is a

697
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,280
direction in the circle. Pi theta of f

698
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,359
is going to mean pi it's abbreviation

699
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:15,320
for pi span of theta of f or direction.

700
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,320
look at the line in that direction.

701
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,160
All right. So, here is a theorem that

702
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,560
says that if you start with a function

703
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,960
that's very little regularity, most of

704
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,119
the projections are even smooth. So

705
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,359
theorem says

706
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:35,520
if f is an l2 function on r to the d and

707
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:37,599
the support of f is in the unit ball

708
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,599
then

709
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:44,000
um if I integrate over the sphere and I

710
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,400
take um

711
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,520
the projection onto the line in the

712
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,520
theta direction of f and I take it ck

713
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,520
norm

714
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,560
um then that is bounded by the L2 norm

715
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,520
of f provided that the dimension is big

716
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,000
enough. So I add the hypothesis to

717
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,920
dimension uh what should it be?

718
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,200
Dimension

719
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,599
D minus one / 2 should be bigger than 12

720
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,599
+ K.

721
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,079
You can unwind that a little bit. It

722
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:22,000
says D is bigger than something

723
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:25,599
right. So for example

724
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,560
D is seven then you can take K equals 2.

725
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,880
So in seven dimensions, take just a L2

726
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,440
function. If you project it down to one

727
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:37,160
dimension in a typical direction, you'll

728
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,160
get something that's C2.

729
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,839
Okay, I'm actually not sure to whom to

730
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,440
attribute this theorem. So I'm I'm in

731
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,520
the process of doing some historical

732
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,670
research and maybe I'll know next class.

733
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,200
All right.

734
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:56,000
[Applause]

735
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,920
So this theorem is also based on the 4A

736
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,640
transform and the way the 4A transform

737
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:05,320
interact with projections.

738
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,320
So now let's think about how that works.

739
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,240
transform

740
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,240
and projections.

741
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,160
All right. So f is a function on r to

742
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,040
the d. It has a 4 a transform. We've

743
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,880
talked about it. Pi V of F is a function

744
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,480
on V. It also has a 4A transform. I just

745
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,000
remind you how it works. So V is a

746
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:53,599
vector space and it basically works the

747
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,359
same way as on on uklidian space. Um

748
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:01,520
okay. So suppose I have a function G

749
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:05,599
from B to C. Um then g hat will also be

750
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:11,040
a function from v to c and ghat of c

751
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:16,720
will be the integral over v of uh g of y

752
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:19,359
e - 2<unk>i i y c d y but dy means with

753
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,200
the volume form for my vector space v.

754
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,760
So that's the for a transform.

755
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,160
Yeah.

756
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:31,200
>> Why do you add the two pi here normally

757
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,800
include the general transform? Is that

758
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,480
just a convention?

759
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,560
>> Yeah. So the question is why is there a

760
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,960
2 pi here? There are a couple different

761
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,839
conventions for the 4a transform. One of

762
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,720
them has a 2 pi here. The other one has

763
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,560
a 1 over 2 pi to the d in the front.

764
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,160
Those are as far as I can tell equally

765
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,320
good. And they both involve some

766
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,599
slightly annoying factors of 2 pi.

767
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,000
There's another convention where you

768
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,400
write neither of those things. Um, that

769
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,319
strictly speaking is not correct, but

770
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,319
it's convenient and it usually is okay.

771
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,960
Uh, okay.

772
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,160
Uh, okay. Then we can do for a inversion

773
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,800
where we recover g of y. Do for a

774
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:18,480
inversion. That's the integral over v

775
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:21,440
ghat x of c e to the 2 pi i y c d volume

776
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,440
of x c.

777
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:29,680
Okay, so that's how the for transform

778
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,920
works on a subspace. Um and um

779
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,920
and now what does projection do to the

780
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,680
for a transform? There's an elegant

781
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:40,720
formula llama call it a a dictionary

782
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,160
lama translates between

783
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,400
the um projection on the physical side

784
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,079
and projection on the forier side and

785
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,520
it's analogous to something that I

786
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,240
called the dictionary lema when we were

787
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,480
doing large s all right it says the

788
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,000
following thing um if I have a function

789
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,640
on r to the d

790
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:06,440
then if I project it to v and take its

791
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,440
fora transform it's just fhat of c

792
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,480
for all c and v.

793
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,240
All right, so let's process a second. So

794
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,800
this is a function on v. It's for a

795
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,640
transform is only defined on v. So this

796
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,839
left hand side only makes sense if c is

797
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:26,240
in v. But it's equal to fhat of c and

798
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:31,040
fhat makes sense for c anywhere in rd.

799
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,640
Okay, so here's the proof. Um

800
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,440
yeah, let's just expand out what

801
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:40,880
everything means. So the left hand side

802
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:43,359
is the integral over v pi v of y eus 2

803
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:48,880
pi i c doy

804
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:52,400
um d volume v of y.

805
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,839
But what is the projection pi v of y?

806
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,240
That's also an integral and it's an

807
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,800
integral over v.

808
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,720
So that's the integral over v integral

809
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,520
over vp

810
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:10,079
f of y + z

811
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:18,040
d volume of z. So that was this thing

812
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:18,040
e to the minus 2 pi i y c d volume of y.

813
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:22,720
All right. So now notice that all

814
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:24,720
together if you put this stuff together

815
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,400
and that and that together we are

816
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:31,119
integrating over r to the d.

817
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,119
Um and so more precisely we can do sort

818
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:40,240
of a change of variables here. We can

819
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:45,760
say x is y + z and dx is dv volume v of

820
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:49,760
y dv volume v of z.

821
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,480
So this is f ofx. This stuff is just dx.

822
00:43:49,760 --> 00:44:00,560
Uh now who is this?

823
00:43:52,480 --> 00:44:05,119
Well, because z is in var and c is in v.

824
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:10,079
Z do c is zero.

825
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:16,720
So e to the minus 2<unk>i i y c is the

826
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:20,079
same thing as e - 2 pi i y + z c.

827
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:25,760
changed it by z which was zero

828
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:27,920
which is e to the minus 2 pi iix x dx

829
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:33,040
okay so I can rewrite everything in

830
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:40,599
terms of x and it's just my integral

831
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:40,599
fx e the minus 2<unk>i ix c dx

832
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,160
all right so that's fhatic c and that's

833
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,160
what we wanted to prove

834
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,240
All right. Good.

835
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,040
Okay.

836
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:35,760
Okay. So let's see what how might we use

837
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:38,319
this? What might this tell us? Um,

838
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,040
so we're interested in this projection

839
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:43,920
thing and the projection plays very

840
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,760
nicely with the forier transform. And so

841
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,440
any anything else that plays nicely with

842
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,720
the for transform, we could sort of try

843
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,319
to figure out how it interacts with

844
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,480
projection.

845
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,000
And one of the fundamental things that

846
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,480
interacts nicely with the for transform

847
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,240
is the L2 norm because we have planer.

848
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,640
So we can write F L2 in terms of F hat.

849
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,760
and fhat is closely related to pi v of

850
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,480
fhat. And let's just see what happens.

851
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,480
What does that tell us?

852
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,160
Okay, so I'll call this um

853
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,400
relating

854
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,560
um

855
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:29,240
f2

856
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:29,240
and pi v of f via the 4a transform.

857
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,640
Okay. And I'm going to focus on pi theta

858
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,640
of f because that will make this the

859
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,640
easiest.

860
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,960
All right. So

861
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,400
f l2^2

862
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:49,599
is f l2.

863
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:56,079
Write that out. It's the integral over r

864
00:46:49,599 --> 00:47:01,040
d f of c^ 2 d c.

865
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:03,040
Okay. and the different um if I take pi

866
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,200
theta of fhat

867
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:08,240
that will correspond to fhat on

868
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,800
different lines through the origin.

869
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,640
So that suggests let's sort of separate

870
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,760
this out in different directions by

871
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:18,000
writing it in polar coordinates.

872
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,280
So this is equal to the integral over

873
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,839
the dus one sphere integral from 0 to

874
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,720
infinity

875
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:33,560
f of r theta^

876
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:33,560
2 r dus1 dr r d theta.

877
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:45,960
Okay. And um

878
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,960
let me do this little trick

879
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,119
to also include negative r so that once

880
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,400
I fix theta I have a nice integral from

881
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:59,920
minus infinity to infinity.

882
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:04,839
All right. So this guy is related to pi

883
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,839
theta of f by this lema.

884
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:13,280
So this is 12

885
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,440
sus1

886
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,040
d theta. So I'm averaging over all the

887
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,520
different directions. And what am I

888
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:21,920
averaging? integrating from minus

889
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,800
infinity to infinity

890
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:27,839
pi theta f

891
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:33,079
of r theta

892
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:33,079
r the dus one dr r

893
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,960
what is this inside thing inside here

894
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:44,079
you know at first you might have thought

895
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,400
you might get the l2 norm of pi theta of

896
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,040
f^2

897
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,599
but that's so that would be the L2 of

898
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:55,839
the F^2.

899
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:59,040
This has this extra factor here

900
00:48:55,839 --> 00:49:00,800
which heavily weights large frequencies

901
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,400
and gives a very low weight to small

902
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,960
frequencies.

903
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,200
Yeah,

904
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,760
>> that's right. This thing is a soalevn

905
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,240
norm. So what what naturally appears

906
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,880
here is a soalev norm. And now let's

907
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,720
pause and we'll review solev norms and

908
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,200
the and some fact important facts about

909
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,200
them.

910
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:26,680
[Applause]

911
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,680
All right.

912
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:51,119
Okay. So definition

913
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:54,000
if I have a function G on a vector space

914
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,160
um like a like a subspace of well a

915
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,200
space with a with uklidian norm.

916
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,520
>> Yeah.

917
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,760
>> Um this is about the dictionary level.

918
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,240
I'm wondering what class of functions

919
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:08,160
that applies to because if f is like an

920
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:11,119
L2 function so f hat is L2 function. How

921
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:14,079
is its value on a measure zero subset

922
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:16,559
like be meaningful?

923
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:18,960
>> Yeah. Okay, great. So the the going back

924
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,760
to the dictionary lema. Um the question

925
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,240
was for which set class of functions

926
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,520
does this actually make sense. And if

927
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,520
you look at what I wrote on the board,

928
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:31,040
it's a little suspicious. It just says

929
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,400
that f is a function. And if f is just a

930
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:36,000
function, actually none of the sides of

931
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:38,160
this equation in general make sense. Um

932
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,640
uh one thing that would that would be

933
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,119
clearly sufficient is if f was a schwarz

934
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,440
function.

935
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:47,119
If f is a schwarz function um f had hat

936
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,400
is awarz function. The projection is a

937
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,040
schwarz function. It's it's for

938
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,000
transformation. So that's all okay. Um

939
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,760
if f is just l2 it's not immediately

940
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,960
obvious how how all of these things

941
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:04,079
would be defined. Um so let's think

942
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:07,680
about this this way for now. Um and

943
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,680
in in in it's fairly often the case that

944
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,359
we can prove things about general L2

945
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:15,200
functions by first proving them for

946
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:16,559
Schwarz functions and then proving um

947
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,440
then using the fact that Schwarz

948
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,440
functions are dense in L2.

949
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,640
Okay. Um

950
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,160
okay good

951
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,640
okay okay so we were remembering what

952
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:42,880
what is a sole fn norm so if I have a

953
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:46,000
function on v then um g hs dot squared

954
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:50,000
is the integral over v

955
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:53,760
I'll take the norm of g hat of c^2

956
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:57,079
um and then I'll put here the norm of C

957
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,079
to the 2s.

958
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:06,480
This makes sense for any real number S.

959
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,839
Um and um

960
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,160
and it has something to do with the

961
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:12,400
smoothness of of of G and in particular

962
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,240
if S is a natural number then it has an

963
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,839
interpretation in terms of L2 norms of

964
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:21,839
derivatives.

965
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:25,040
So um G H1 dot squared

966
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:29,440
is the sum over different directions J

967
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:33,680
of the J derivative of G L2 at least

968
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:37,839
approximately maybe exactly um and then

969
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:40,640
um higher values of S higher values of S

970
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:42,000
correspond to taking more derivatives so

971
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,200
I'll just put one more and you'll see

972
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:49,359
the pattern h2 dot squared is around the

973
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:53,200
sum over J1 and J2 of the second

974
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:56,720
derivative in the J1 J2 directions of G

975
00:52:53,200 --> 00:53:03,040
L2 and so on.

976
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:05,040
Okay. Um and if S is not an integer then

977
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,440
there's not a direct interpretation of

978
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:11,119
this form but it is still kind of

979
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:14,240
measuring how smooth the function G is.

980
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:16,400
Okay. There is also a regular. So this

981
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:19,359
is the sole f norm with a dot. It's

982
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,280
called the homogeneous soalef norm. And

983
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:26,319
there's a version without the dot which

984
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:32,720
is defined like this. Um

985
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:38,400
gh hs 2 is the integral over v ghat of c

986
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:40,319
^ 2 uh 1 + the norm of c ^ 2 to the s d

987
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,599
c

988
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:45,280
which is roughly the same um as if you

989
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:48,319
took out the biggest power. This would

990
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:52,800
be 1 + c 2s

991
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:55,680
and the one contributes gl 2^ 2

992
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,520
and the c to the 2s is this thing. So it

993
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:01,000
contributes

994
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,000
hs dot.

995
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,440
Okay.

996
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,440
Um

997
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,960
cool. So there's a well-known um set of

998
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:20,559
theorems called the soalev embedding

999
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,960
theorems which imply that if g is in a

1000
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:25,280
soalev space for a big enough s then it

1001
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:31,040
is continuous and if even a bigger s

1002
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:34,440
then it's c1 and so on. Um so I will

1003
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,440
write a summary.

1004
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:45,119
So belove embedding. Um

1005
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:50,720
if s is bigger than

1006
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:56,640
1/2 the dimension of v um then

1007
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:59,760
g l infinity is bounded by g in hs

1008
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:02,760
and um and if g is in hs then g is

1009
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,760
continuous.

1010
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:11,680
And if we add um if s is bigger than

1011
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:15,520
some k plus 1/2 the dimension of v um

1012
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:21,079
then the kith derivatives

1013
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,079
of g are bounded by the hs norm

1014
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,599
and if g is in hs then it's ck

1015
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,920
Okay.

1016
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,480
Um, any questions or comments about sov

1017
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,480
spaces?

1018
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:03,839
Okay. Um so

1019
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:07,280
now that we have recalled that

1020
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:10,640
if we look back here

1021
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:13,920
we will recognize what appears here as a

1022
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,640
solev norm of the projection.

1023
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:20,319
So the L2 norm squar of f is this

1024
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:24,960
integral and this thing here

1025
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:28,480
is the hs norm of pi theta of f. So this

1026
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,240
is 12 integral over the d minus one

1027
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,920
sphere

1028
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:38,319
pi theta of f h

1029
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:40,720
d -1 / 2 dot^ 2

1030
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:42,400
d theta.

1031
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,880
Okay. Where did this come from and why

1032
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:47,599
does it have a dot? This r is the norm

1033
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:52,400
of my frequency c.

1034
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:55,440
So this is the norm of c to the 2 s. So

1035
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,119
s is d minus one over two. And it's

1036
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,000
homogeneous. We don't have this extra

1037
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:01,000
one. So there's a dot.

1038
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:07,559
Okay. Cool.

1039
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,559
Cool.

1040
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,559
Um

1041
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:25,520
okay so now you can pro probably have a

1042
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,359
good guess of how we would like to prove

1043
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,839
this theorem.

1044
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:31,599
The L2 norm

1045
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:34,640
controls an integral like this with the

1046
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:38,000
soelv norm. Sov embedding tells us that

1047
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:40,720
the soilv norm controls the ck norm.

1048
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,559
So that's the plan. Okay. But

1049
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,720
technically there is a small technical

1050
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:47,599
issue which has to do with the dot or

1051
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,200
the no dot. Dot and no dot homogeneous

1052
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,680
not homogeneous are both natural and

1053
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,359
important. Homogeneous one will occur

1054
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:56,319
naturally in some places. It naturally

1055
00:57:53,359 --> 00:58:00,640
occurred here. On the other hand sov

1056
00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:03,359
embedding is a theorem that requires uh

1057
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,040
that the non-homogeneous soil of space.

1058
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:08,520
So we need to do a little bit of work to

1059
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,520
to get between

1060
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:41,160
Okay.

1061
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,160
Um so now we can do proof of theorem.

1062
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:55,760
All right. So integral sdus1

1063
00:58:50,640 --> 00:59:01,119
pi theta f c k k d theta is bounded by

1064
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:07,280
integral sdus one pi thetaf f

1065
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:11,799
h dus1 / 2 without the dot squared d

1066
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,799
theta so this is so embedded

1067
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,720
okay and that hypothesis about d up

1068
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:19,040
there is just exactly the hypothesis

1069
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:23,720
that you need for this to be true when

1070
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:23,720
you plug in so embedding.

1071
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,880
All right, now let's open up the

1072
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:32,240
definition of this thing and we'll

1073
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:34,079
almost see the FL2 norm squared but not

1074
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:38,000
quite.

1075
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:41,920
So this is around integral of sdus one

1076
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:47,440
integral from minus infinity to infinity

1077
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:49,280
f of r theta^ 2 and we'll have 1 + r dus

1078
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:53,000
1

1079
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,000
d r d theta.

1080
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:58,640
So we don't have a dot that requires us

1081
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:01,040
to put this extra one that we didn't

1082
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,880
have before.

1083
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,280
All right. So you have a sum of two

1084
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,040
pieces. In real analysis, we usually

1085
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,000
think about which of the two pieces is

1086
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:12,480
bigger. So if r is bigger than one, this

1087
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,559
piece dominates. And if r is smaller

1088
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:22,160
than one, that piece dominates.

1089
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:24,240
So it's the integral sus one integral r

1090
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:30,640
bigger than 1

1091
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:33,920
f of r theta^ 2 r dus r d theta. Let's

1092
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:37,680
call that term number one.

1093
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:43,280
Plus the integral sdus one integral r

1094
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:49,079
smaller than one f of r theta^ 2

1095
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:49,079
1 * 1 d r d.

1096
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:53,160
Let's call this piece two.

1097
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:02,799
Okay.

1098
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:07,040
So piece one is uh clearly smaller than

1099
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:13,079
what we had before which was f L2 squ.

1100
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:13,079
So piece one smaller than L2.

1101
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:21,599
Piece two.

1102
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,119
Okay. In piece two I think it's no

1103
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:25,920
longer really helpful to think of this

1104
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:28,799
as being related to polar coordinates.

1105
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:32,880
We're integrating over a sphere cross

1106
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:34,960
and interval and that's a finite volume.

1107
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,880
And so what I'd like to put here is just

1108
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,720
that it's bounded by the a constant

1109
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:42,680
which is the volume times the biggest

1110
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,680
possible size of this

1111
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,599
super.

1112
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:55,760
Okay. So how big is that?

1113
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:59,760
So fhat of c

1114
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:05,839
bounded by the integral f(x) e - 2<unk>i

1115
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:07,599
iix x c dx and the most common approach

1116
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:12,720
the easiest approach to this is use the

1117
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:15,839
triangle inequality so we have this

1118
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,359
now we have the l1 norm of f okay so we

1119
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,960
have two pieces one piece is controlled

1120
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:22,720
by the l2 norm of f the other piece is

1121
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:24,799
controlled by the l1 norm of f um I

1122
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,400
could have written the theorem that way

1123
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:28,720
But I wrote it a little bit differently.

1124
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,960
I thought it was cuter. Uh I've had the

1125
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:32,480
support of f is in the unit ball. If the

1126
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,319
support of f is in the unit ball, then

1127
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,920
we can control the L1 norm by the L2

1128
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:37,520
norm.

1129
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,240
So

1130
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:44,720
since the support of F is in the unit

1131
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:49,040
ball integral of f ofx

1132
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:51,520
dx looks like that. It's bounded by the

1133
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:54,160
integral of f(x)^2

1134
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:57,359
to the 12 times the integral over the

1135
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:01,000
unit ball of 1 to the 12. So that's

1136
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:01,000
bounded by f2.

1137
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:10,240
Okay. So using using the support I can

1138
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:12,960
bound both one and two by FL2

1139
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:15,760
and um

1140
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,720
okay and that was that was what I had

1141
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,559
thought of as the proof of the theorem

1142
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,480
but now is a good moment to come back to

1143
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:23,839
the question that was asked earlier.

1144
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,760
What do you actually have to assume

1145
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:32,319
about f for all of this to make sense?

1146
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:34,640
Um okay. Um so let me add some fine

1147
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:37,640
print. I'll write what we actually

1148
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,640
proved.

1149
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:45,839
Um

1150
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,559
all right. So the fine print is for for

1151
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:51,200
the time being suppose that f is a

1152
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:53,119
schwarz function.

1153
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:55,440
We needed f is a Schwarz function to

1154
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,760
justify our formula about the 4A

1155
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,039
transform of the projection and in a few

1156
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,760
other places to make sure all these for

1157
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:03,440
a transforms make sense. If you assume

1158
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:07,280
that F is Schwarz, everything we wrote

1159
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:11,599
makes sense. Um and we get this estimate

1160
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:13,920
and and this is an inequality.

1161
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,280
And then it is now possible to do some

1162
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,039
extra work. If you have a function

1163
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,359
that's not Schwarz, just a function in

1164
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:23,440
L2, you could have a sequence of Schwarz

1165
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:25,039
functions that approximate it and um and

1166
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,200
for each one of those approximating

1167
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,720
functions, this bound would be true. And

1168
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,480
then with some work, you could show that

1169
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:33,799
the bound is also true for the limiting

1170
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,799
function f.

1171
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:45,250
Okay. So I'll put a remark

1172
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:51,250
um can remove the hypothesis.

1173
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:51,250
[Applause]

1174
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:07,760
Okay.

1175
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:11,559
Um, so any questions or comments about

1176
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:11,559
the proof of this theorem?

1177
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:24,400
>> Is the condition that the support is in

1178
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:27,039
the unit essential to this?

1179
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,039
>> Yeah. Okay. So the question is, is the

1180
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,880
assumption that the support of F is in

1181
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,559
the unit ball essential? What would

1182
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,280
happen if we remove this assumption?

1183
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:36,240
>> Right.

1184
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,400
>> Yeah. So looking at the proof, we could

1185
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:42,280
um

1186
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,280
let me get another color.

1187
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:52,720
Looking at the proof, we could if we

1188
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,760
want to remove this assumption. And then

1189
01:05:52,720 --> 01:06:00,720
we would need to add the L1 norm as well

1190
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:03,680
as the L2 norm um to deal with um

1191
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:05,920
uh due to my brilliant neighbor labeling

1192
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:08,079
scheme, term one is bounded by the L2

1193
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:11,079
norm and term two is bounded by the L1

1194
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:11,079
norm.

1195
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:16,079
Okay, I haven't thought about it

1196
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:19,200
carefully. You you could ask if we did

1197
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:21,440
this uh would it still be true? I

1198
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,359
suspect that's not true and the sort of

1199
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,000
natural example to look at is a function

1200
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:27,359
on a really big ball. I haven't I

1201
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
haven't thought it through carefully.

1202
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:34,039
So, it's good a good little good little

1203
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,039
project to figure out what happens.

1204
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,280
Okay.

1205
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:54,880
Okay. So the um big big picture takeaway

1206
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,799
of this theorem is we take a function in

1207
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,359
high dimensions which is not very

1208
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:01,440
regular and when we project it to low

1209
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:04,880
dimensions most of the projections are

1210
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,799
much more regular and um I was trying to

1211
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,079
think of places that this relates to or

1212
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:12,160
we might have seen something like this

1213
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:13,760
before. Um and one place where we see

1214
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,160
something like this is the central limit

1215
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,760
theorem in probability.

1216
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:22,599
Um,

1217
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,599
so let me remind us how that works.

1218
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:56,799
Okay. So suppose that XJ are random

1219
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,880
variables

1220
01:07:56,799 --> 01:08:02,799
which are uniformly distributed

1221
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:08,760
in 01

1222
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:08,760
and there are a lot of them one up to n.

1223
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:12,960
Okay. So in the central limit theorem we

1224
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:16,400
might think what happens if we add up

1225
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:19,520
all these random variables.

1226
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:22,480
Um so and we could look at the sum of

1227
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,080
the XJ. This will be the random

1228
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,759
variable.

1229
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:28,239
Actually let me put it not that

1230
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:30,319
important but going to put minus a half

1231
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:33,560
a half. The central limit theorem is a

1232
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,560
little bit nicer.

1233
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:41,120
Uh okay. So what happens when I add them

1234
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:43,199
up? and I add them up. The central limit

1235
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,600
theorem

1236
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:47,600
says that the sum of these random

1237
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:52,319
variables

1238
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:58,480
is approximately a Gaussian

1239
01:08:52,319 --> 01:09:02,759
with mean zero and um standard deviation

1240
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,759
something like square root of n.

1241
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:11,239
And notice in particular that it's quite

1242
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:11,239
smooth.

1243
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:17,319
Okay.

1244
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:17,319
So

1245
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:25,040
um okay. So the probability the joint

1246
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:28,040
probability density function of these

1247
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,040
XJS

1248
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:38,560
XJ

1249
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:43,880
is f of x1 up to xn. It's the

1250
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:43,880
characteristic function of the cube.

1251
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,960
So this is a sort of typical this is an

1252
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:51,839
example of a function that's in L2 but

1253
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:55,760
is not continuous.

1254
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:57,520
Okay. Uh now what is what is the

1255
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:01,199
probability density function of this

1256
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:04,640
thing? Um well, we have a map. Um I

1257
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:10,159
guess the summation map goes from Rn to

1258
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:13,440
R and it just takes X1 up to Xn and it

1259
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:16,000
maps it to X1 plus F plus Xn. Add them

1260
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:20,000
up. It's a linear map.

1261
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,480
So the probability

1262
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:27,520
density function

1263
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:33,080
of um of the sum of the xjs

1264
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:33,080
is the push forward of fdx

1265
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:38,239
and this is a slightly different

1266
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:41,280
language but it is up to a small change

1267
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:42,850
of variables. It's the projection of f

1268
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:46,039
on the main diagonal.

1269
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:46,039
[Applause]

1270
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:50,000
So

1271
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:51,600
[Applause]

1272
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,760
actually

1273
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:56,080
I can make we can make this look nicer

1274
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:58,480
if we normalize in the central limit

1275
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:00,239
theorem which is not a which is a fairly

1276
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,679
standard way of writing it. So let me

1277
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:04,679
write the central limit theorem this

1278
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:04,679
way.

1279
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,640
Okay. So now my function is

1280
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:21,280
that

1281
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:24,800
and let's say that theta is 1 /<unk> n11

1282
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:27,360
which is in which is a unit vector. So

1283
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:32,600
this is just the projection I'll call it

1284
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:32,600
theta 1 in the theta 1 direction of f.

1285
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,080
Okay.

1286
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:40,800
So I take the characteristic function of

1287
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:43,840
the cube. If I project it in that

1288
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,600
direction, I get something that is

1289
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:48,800
almost a Gaussian. And that's the

1290
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:51,040
central limit there.

1291
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:55,480
And notice in particular that the that

1292
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,480
that that projection is quite smooth.

1293
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,440
So if I were to take the cube and I were

1294
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:01,280
just going to project it onto the x1

1295
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:03,360
axis,

1296
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,960
well the other variables would be

1297
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,640
irrelevant and I would just get the

1298
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,880
characteristic function of an interval

1299
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:11,679
and it would not be any smoother than it

1300
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,280
was before. Still be discontinuous. And

1301
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:14,719
that's the same I could project it onto

1302
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,199
any of the axes. They're all the same.

1303
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:19,840
That would be uh characteristic function

1304
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:22,239
of an integral. But if I project it onto

1305
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,679
the main diagonal then I get the thing

1306
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:25,920
in the central limit theorem which is

1307
01:12:23,679 --> 01:12:29,360
extremely smooth and you know the the

1308
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:31,120
the the more I increase the dimension

1309
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:34,640
the more it looks like a Gaussian and in

1310
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:37,280
particular the smoother it gets.

1311
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:39,040
Okay. Now in the central limit theorem

1312
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:41,760
it actually is not terribly important

1313
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:44,719
that all of these are exactly one. It's

1314
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,719
just important that they're roughly

1315
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:49,360
equal to each other.

1316
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:52,159
So as long as you take a direction which

1317
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:54,320
is doesn't emphasize any of the

1318
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,520
coordinate axes too much, you'll see

1319
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,440
something like the central limit

1320
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,040
theorem. So in all of those directions,

1321
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,400
the projection will look quite smooth

1322
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:02,800
and in fact it will look a lot like a

1323
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,800
Gaussian.

1324
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,560
Uh or where but if you were to project

1325
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,640
it in the bad directions and in a

1326
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,159
coordinate direction or combination of a

1327
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,440
couple coordinate directions, then

1328
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:14,440
you'll get something that's not so

1329
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:14,440
smooth.

1330
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,880
Okay, so that's an example of this

1331
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,880
theorem.

1332
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,560
And in this special example, we can say

1333
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,400
much more refined things about which

1334
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,880
directions are good and bad and exactly

1335
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:28,159
what happens. Um, but this theorem is a

1336
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,760
lot more general because you don't have

1337
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:31,679
to put in the characteristic function of

1338
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,679
a cube. You can put in quite a broad

1339
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:38,679
range of functions

1340
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:38,679
and qualitatively similar things happen.

1341
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:53,360
Yeah,

1342
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,760
>> dumb but like this theorem we proved

1343
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:57,920
earlier it's really saying like when you

1344
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:01,280
integrate you make it smoother like it's

1345
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:06,400
a projection is an integration.

1346
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:10,320
>> Yes. Yes. The comment is the comment is

1347
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:13,600
that when we project we project by

1348
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:15,280
integrating some of the variables and so

1349
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:17,120
the comment is when we integrate

1350
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,960
something we make it smoother. That's a

1351
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:22,000
really nice comment and it reminds us of

1352
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,679
something uh more familiar and

1353
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,280
fundamental just like if you had a

1354
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:28,080
function of one variable that was just

1355
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:29,600
in L2 say or L1 if you integrated it it

1356
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:31,040
would get smoother. If you integrated it

1357
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,040
a whole bunch of times, then you would

1358
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,880
get something smooth.

1359
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,480
Yeah. So, this is a little bit like this

1360
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,760
is this is a little bit like that. And I

1361
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,600
guess the smoothness does come from

1362
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,159
doing the integration.

1363
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,360
>> Um, in this situation,

1364
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:45,360
>> yeah, what's it?

1365
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:47,760
>> The bounds are interesting. So, like

1366
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:49,920
like how smooth it is is interesting.

1367
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,520
>> Yes, the bounds are interesting. Yes.

1368
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:53,040
Yeah. And I guess one of the differences

1369
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,719
here is, you know, this this function

1370
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,640
depends on many variables. We're going

1371
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:58,080
to integrate some of them but not

1372
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:02,360
others.

1373
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:02,360
Um, and so

1374
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:07,920
yeah, anyway, so it and then it depends

1375
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:09,600
which ones we integrate whether or not

1376
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:13,320
it gets smoother, but it turns out that

1377
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,320
usually it does.

1378
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,600
Yeah. But yeah, I think that I think

1379
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:23,280
that is a good way of looking at it.

1380
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,960
Yeah.

1381
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:27,440
Cool.

1382
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,040
Cool. Okay. So let me end by mentioning

1383
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,719
so as part of the class I'll try to

1384
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:34,080
mention different ways that that

1385
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:37,679
projection theory is related to various

1386
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:41,600
parts of math. Um and so this reminds me

1387
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:43,840
of something I heard about um which is

1388
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:47,600
about trying to generalize the central

1389
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:51,199
limit theorem. So what if the input was

1390
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:53,600
not um independent random variables but

1391
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:55,440
something somewhat more general? Would

1392
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,040
it still be true that when we take a

1393
01:15:55,440 --> 01:16:00,000
projection like this, you would see a

1394
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:01,520
Gaussian?

1395
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,480
Um,

1396
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:06,320
and so there's a a big a big body of of

1397
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,400
work on that. Um, but what one

1398
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,960
interesting direction I heard about is

1399
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,800
initiated by Keith Ball and it's

1400
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,280
connection between probability theory

1401
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:18,159
and convex geometry. And the point of

1402
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,840
view is that maybe to some extent what's

1403
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:22,400
important about the cube is just that

1404
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:26,400
it's a convex set. So instead of the

1405
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:29,199
cube, take any convex set in R to the N.

1406
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:31,199
N is large.

1407
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:32,320
Okay. Now there's no distinguished like

1408
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:34,719
there's nothing special about the

1409
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:36,880
coordinate axis anymore. So so it's not

1410
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:38,320
the coordinate axis projections aren't

1411
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:41,360
necessarily the ones that are bad that

1412
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:43,199
this one isn't necessarily good. But the

1413
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,520
the question he raised is maybe you take

1414
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:48,159
any convex set and look at its

1415
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:52,719
projections onto one-dimensional spaces.

1416
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:52,719
Maybe most of them are almost Gaussian.

1417
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,239
Okay. And that's a recent topic of

1418
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,199
research and a significant amount like

1419
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:02,960
that is true. Um, uh, Keith Ball gave an

1420
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:05,120
ICM talk about it and I put some

1421
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:09,080
references in the homework if anybody is

1422
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:09,080
interested in reading about it.

1423
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,679
Cool.

1424
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:15,760
Um, okay. Well, let's let's stop there

1425
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,600
for today.

1426
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:19,440
uh to to the plan for Thursday is to

1427
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,960
come back to the large civ which is done

1428
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:23,120
which is from number theory and I'll try

1429
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,719
to tell you some some things what kind

1430
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,440
of applications in number theory does

1431
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:27,440
the large civ
