1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,560
how are you all feeling today very that

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,080
was a rhetoric question I want to show

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,320
that you know health and Healthcare is

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,240
so close to every person and how we all

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,280
have deeply personal relationship with

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,039
health so uh I want to talk about a new

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,920
program starting with MIT on uh Health

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,960
Science semiconductor Ai and advanced

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,800
biology and uh what is exciting about

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,679
this project is that we are addressing

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,160
not only one of the most press topics of

12
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:34,920
our time uh for those of you who have

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,360
been in the meeting yesterday or the

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,719
presentation yesterday about 20% of GDP

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,840
more than $2 and5 trillion dollars is

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,920
spend on healthc care and still uh we

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,120
are talking about kind of growing faster

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,520
than GDP and the expectation is that

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:59,079
based on the chart I have here by uh

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,559
sorry by by uh 2040 is going to be 30%

21
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,400
of the GDP just Healthcare so that see

22
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,400
shows the enormity of the problem and

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,960
how we can uh Change the World by making

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,000
an impact

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,840
there uh I didn't know about that I got

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,600
the information from some of the people

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,360
who work in Pharma and bio drug

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,360
Discovery cost about a billion dollar

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,119
per drug and that is enormous amount of

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,400
money and diagnostic is about 10% of the

31
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,320
total cost of healthcare and as I said

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,400
uh these things are growing one thing

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,119
that I couldn't put a dollar sign in

34
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,640
front of it is the value of not being

35
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,399
sick that is enormous because I'm sure

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,079
there is a lot of interesting topics we

37
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:45,399
can cover on that front so um one thing

38
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,640
that I want to highlight is that so why

39
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,719
we are trying to focus on nanotechnology

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,759
aspects of the healthcare the chart on

41
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,119
the right shows that how semiconductor

42
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,960
technology is growing uh today

43
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,759
semiconductor technology is about half a

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,240
trillion dollars and it took us about

45
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,600
60 something to 70 years to get to here

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,079
and the expectation is that by 2030 it's

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,599
going to be a trillion dollars so it's

48
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,920
doubling in 7

49
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:14,640
years compared to what happened last uh

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,120
last seven decades so that is an

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,280
enormous opportunity to have

52
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,840
semiconductor and I'm going to use nanot

53
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,239
technology rather than semiconductor

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,680
because covers also Ms Technologies and

55
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:29,239
this could be very exciting why because

56
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,560
it's extremely affordable and extremely

57
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,080
powerful

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,480
look at what's happening around you in

59
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,120
terms of capabilities of your

60
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,239
smartphones your doorbells and

61
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,200
everything around you is becoming so

62
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,760
intelligent and so connected the other

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,560
of course Revolution that is happening

64
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,599
is the data Revolution on the left side

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,159
of it what you see is that the amount of

66
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,920
data is introduced to us is about a

67
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:56,319
thousand times more than the server

68
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,519
power that is supporting data so we are

69
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,200
we have to grow 1,000x on server power

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,120
to keep up with the amount of data that

71
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,080
we dealing with so how can we leverage

72
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:10,680
these two revolutions to change or come

73
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,920
up with transformative opportunities in

74
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,319
healthcare AI is already changing

75
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,799
Healthcare I don't have time to go

76
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,720
through that but each of these are very

77
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,959
interesting topic this genomics is

78
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,319
becoming very exciting part how to get

79
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,959
all this data and use AI for that

80
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,720
identifying potential drug targets

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,159
that's a fascinating topic um detecting

82
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,760
and analyzing 20 ,000 protein molecules

83
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:36,280
and use the machine learning how to take

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,599
it to the next level of information and

85
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,480
Drug Discovery phenotyping and genetic

86
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,360
heterogenity and robotic surgery robotic

87
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,560
surgery I don't know if you have seen

88
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,360
this but I was in one of these major

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,079
robotic surgery companies and with 11

90
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,079
needle size arms going inside the

91
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,000
patient in the less than half an inch

92
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:59,400
opening and does all the surgeries while

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,040
doctor is sitting the other side of the

94
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,519
room in front of monitor controlling it

95
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:08,159
and Recovery is a lot faster Precision

96
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,040
is higher and machines are controlling a

97
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,879
lot of diagnostic aspects of it and one

98
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,199
of the things that are very close to my

99
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:20,400
heart because I was involved and working

100
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,639
on that one is the development of this

101
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,880
uh patch which is clinical quality

102
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,919
continuous glucose monitoring and U now

103
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,560
with the amount of data you can offer on

104
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,120
a real time you can not only use it for

105
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,680
Diagnostic but for many treatment

106
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,120
purposes so Confluence of three topics

107
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,039
and three Innovations in science and

108
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,520
technology put us in a very unique

109
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:47,639
position to offer new solutions for

110
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,479
health semiconductor nanotechnology Ai

111
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,320
and biology again since time is short

112
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,759
I'm going to briefly talk about that the

113
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,960
fact that you can have a minimally

114
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,120
invive bio sensor with a lot of advanced

115
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,120
electronics on the patch on your arm or

116
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,400
your chest or your neck that can

117
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,000
revolutionize a lot of things what you

118
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,800
see in biology on therapeutic on

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,080
proteomics and some of the

120
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,880
pharmacogenomics it's amazing how you

121
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,400
can come up with a different insight

122
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,479
into Diagnostic and therapeutic sites of

123
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,880
molecules so the question is how

124
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,319
technology can break this continuous

125
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,440
growth of the healthcare cost without

126
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,960
compromising quality the answer is

127
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,160
personalized Healthcare that has been

128
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,039
around for quite a while how we can

129
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,759
individualize healthare so that we can

130
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,720
tailor the diagnostic and treatment to

131
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,680
individuals and the way to do that is

132
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,800
really to have a real time information

133
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,880
close the loop with AI and offer

134
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,639
treatments that are optimized for the

135
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,000
individuals so this chart came from a

136
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:57,240
work between imch and IBM or another

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,160
company I mean nature publication but

138
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,160
it's interesting to show that

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,160
in addition to mors law which is now

140
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,479
getting to the limits uh really there

141
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,400
are a lot of other branches that are

142
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,680
even more relevant to healthcare because

143
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,319
a lot of these devices like this glucose

144
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,680
patch that I showed you uses about a

145
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,560
couple of 100K Gates it doesn't need 2

146
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,120
nanometer technology or anything like

147
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,400
that in fact we are happy with 45

148
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,280
nanometer for these devices plus the

149
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,759
fact that the RF side is a Bluetooth

150
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,240
that is using 45 nanometer technology as

151
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,680
well but it requires silicon germanium

152
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,039
it requires some sensing devices like

153
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,160
nanowires it requires Nano pores and a

154
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:40,759
lot of technologies that are not

155
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,560
necessarily A next generation of the

156
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,720
seos but the derivatives that we think

157
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,240
is very important for this technology so

158
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,440
again in the interest of time I'm not

159
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,639
going to spend a lot of time on that one

160
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,400
but I want to highlight the fact

161
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,599
that semiconductor magic is unparalleled

162
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,800
with anything else in the human history

163
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:05,240
the fact that we get get a $2 million

164
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,879
radar about 25 years ago and make a chip

165
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,759
that is doing exactly the same thing for

166
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,000
less than

167
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:14,360
$10 what other field do you know that

168
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,360
over 30 years can save the cost four

169
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,360
orders of magnitude with the same

170
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,960
functionality can you imagine if your

171
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,800
car your or the plane was like as

172
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,520
efficient as we're talking semiconductor

173
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,520
we have been traveling a speed of light

174
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,919
or a cray superc computer becomes a

175
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,639
laptop and here are examples that you

176
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,080
see in the real world we have a lot of

177
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,440
interesting opportunities to bring

178
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,479
Electronics to the healthcare at

179
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,800
clinical quality to close the loop

180
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:48,080
between sensing Ai and

181
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,000
transducer so let me I stole my thunder

182
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,759
already let me tell you how we are going

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,639
to work on this thing there are two

184
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,960
elements to that or two approaches one

185
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,360
is bio Inspire I don't know if you have

186
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,400
noticed in your recent flight I'm flying

187
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,080
every week so I've noticed a lot there

188
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,319
is a winglet these days around the PLS I

189
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,879
mean the end of the wi goes up it's a

190
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,560
famous theory of finite elements that

191
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,400
you can reduce the drag by using

192
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,840
wingless boing invented that a lot of

193
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,759
scientists work on the on the um finite

194
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,199
element techniques to come up with that

195
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,280
you know that Eagles have been doing

196
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,960
that for about a million years they have

197
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,639
been GL already they know how to reduce

198
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,520
the drag why don't we learn from these

199
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,039
and we try to invent the wheel I don't

200
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,520
know if you're creationist or you're

201
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,760
evolutionist but either way there's a

202
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,560
lot of intelligence there and the beauty

203
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,719
of that is we can learn from that the

204
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:42,320
problem is we are stuck with old ways of

205
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,680
doing things one noan served us well

206
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,279
since 40s so every architecture we are

207
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,160
trying to mold it into that architecture

208
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,240
why don't we learn from the fact that 10

209
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,959
to the 16 flops in the brain only Burns

210
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,720
10 Watt and a typical GPU requires a

211
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:01,000
nuclear power reactor so something is

212
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,000
wrong in in terms of processing

213
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,279
capabilities there is one tiny issue we

214
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,440
don't know how brain works still all the

215
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,760
billions of dollars there but we know

216
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,200
that brain is not working based on one

217
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,920
Oney machine I mean it doesn't digitize

218
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,760
data it doesn't have memory and

219
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,200
processor separately and we can learn a

220
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,200
lot lot from

221
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,399
that uh I don't know how much time we

222
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,120
have but we have a project that is very

223
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,200
interesting because our ears the way

224
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,959
that our ears analyze voice the ear can

225
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,240
has these 2,000 tiny muscles and when

226
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,120
the air goes through the canal it

227
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,399
already depending on stiffness of these

228
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,480
muscles it does an automatic fft so what

229
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,200
it sends to the brain is not raw data

230
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,000
it's the pulses that are signatures of

231
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,640
the frequency domain of data that is

232
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,959
fascinating and the power consumption is

233
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,399
orders of magnitudes less than a typical

234
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:59,560
microphone and Tia and sigma Delta and

235
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,320
processor and so on and so forth so

236
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,360
there is a lot to gain from there the

237
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,480
challenge is how to make it more

238
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,000
platform than kind of Niche so here's a

239
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,800
typical sensor that we are thinking

240
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,200
about in the future neumorphic

241
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,240
neuromorphic processing of course

242
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,440
Optical

243
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,600
interconnect power from the

244
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,880
backside uh

245
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,360
cim Computing memory and of course a

246
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,600
range of sensors that you're are putting

247
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,360
on top of that so the vision we talking

248
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,360
about in this new center which is

249
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,040
collaboration with IMC linol lab and

250
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,800
Mass General Hospital is how to close

251
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,360
the

252
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:42,560
loop sensing modality on the left hand

253
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,120
side that's where we have molecular

254
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,240
sensing RF sensing impedance

255
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,440
spectroscopy um vital sensing and so on

256
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,160
of course doctors and Physicians are not

257
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,399
comfortable with this massive amount of

258
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,480
data so we take it to a learning machine

259
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,880
how to take that data translate it to

260
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,839
information and then fit it to

261
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,120
actionable uh kind of uh clinical plan

262
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,560
so that we can have a drug delivery

263
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,680
optimized based on individuals

264
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,839
metabolism or other ways of stimulation

265
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,200
that uh is very practical today uh and

266
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,440
it was just a dream 5 years ago there is

267
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:24,480
no timer here so let me know when I'm

268
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,839
minutes another three minutes no not

269
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,839
negotiable okay

270
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,160
so I have another 10is slide so

271
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,760
5 Second for a okay

272
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,200
so so what's happening on the bio

273
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,440
semiconductor and nanotechnology we see

274
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:44,839
that detection of the molecules analysis

275
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,600
of dnas and uh proteins diagnostic uh

276
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:48,079
protein isopor that you know you have

277
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,399
heard about a lot and yesterday we

278
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,279
talked about that drug delivery cell

279
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,399
culture and general cell manipulation

280
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,519
all of them not necessarily with

281
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,440
transistors but some combination of

282
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,279
nanotechnologies and SOS readout or or

283
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,880
maybe some stimulation through acoustic

284
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,399
waves or

285
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,639
Optical uh so you know mems guys like

286
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,839
caner liers because caner liers are very

287
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,160
sensitive when you get to Nano level the

288
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,519
problem is they are very sensitive to

289
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,880
everything temperature pressure

290
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,680
everything so it takes a lot of work to

291
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,120
make it reproducible but now you can

292
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,079
imagine a mems with multiple caner lers

293
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,519
functionalized for different molecules

294
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,279
and depending on which molecule you

295
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,959
absorb you get a different stiffness and

296
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,680
you read out the stiffness and you can

297
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,320
have

298
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,160
a lab on a chip so lab on a chip which

299
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,920
was a dream now is very much practical

300
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,839
and

301
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,079
doable since I have three minutes I'm

302
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:45,199
going to skip some of the most exciting

303
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:48,480
stuff out so it was your call you know

304
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:50,839
so anyways so uh we have this up to

305
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,519
acoustic ultrasonic and cardio patch

306
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,399
just watch it and then I'll talk to

307
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,959
about that later so five modalities that

308
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:03,000
we are focusing on in this talk and in

309
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:06,920
this lab one is chemical clinicians and

310
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
scientists in BIO love molecules so one

311
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,600
way is that bringing molecule right on

312
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,880
top of the semiconductor exposing

313
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,120
semiconductor to molecule and then

314
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,519
detect variations for example threshold

315
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,079
voltage or variations of characteristics

316
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,920
of transistors it's very

317
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:26,320
powerful and we love it because we are

318
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,800
working on a minimally invasive way let

319
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,440
me tell you a secret about semiconductor

320
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,880
semi conductor industry loves

321
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,040
scale Texas instrument shipped more than

322
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,600
50 billion chips last year it has to be

323
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,600
millions and hundred millions and

324
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,079
billions because scale brings

325
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,199
affordability cost and functionality so

326
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:51,079
when things are minimally invasive they

327
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:53,399
scale if they're invasive they're very

328
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,600
important but they don't scale how many

329
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,120
people are willing to inject

330
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,800
Semiconductor in their body if they are

331
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:02,240
healthy so that is why we are focusing

332
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,199
on minimally invasive stuff magnetics

333
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,360
they have some fast so the way that you

334
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:09,560
can talk to molecules is not just

335
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,720
chemistry that's the main message that

336
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,519
we are trying to give jointly with IMC

337
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,759
and lincol and MGH it's not just

338
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,160
chemistry you can interrogate molecules

339
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:22,120
through photonics you can interrogate

340
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,199
molecules through Ultrasonics or

341
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:29,199
magnetics and there are examples of that

342
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:32,040
but again I'm not going to cover it so

343
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,480
so here is what uh Dr Jaffer shared with

344
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,880
me that was very interesting uh concept

345
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,000
to combine

346
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,800
the um continuous monitoring with a

347
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,199
digital twin of

348
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,360
organs and with that you can have a

349
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,920
profile of organ of individual patient

350
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,160
and see what's going on in terms of

351
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,360
Diagnostic and Drug delivery there is

352
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,880
one biological problem here in the body

353
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,279
organs don't work

354
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,000
independently so what happens in your

355
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,920
liver and heart and brain are very

356
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,240
tightly coupled that's why you get

357
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,720
higher blood pressure when you're

358
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,839
anxious so what we need to do is that we

359
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,199
need to expand the concept and making it

360
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,959
a little bit more

361
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,839
holistic uh I'm going to skip lab on a

362
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:15,959
cheap microfluidic and I want to borrow

363
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,160
a statement from yoga bear the future is

364
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:20,440
not what it used to be anymore and

365
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,639
that's why because of the all the

366
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,519
combination of new uh ways of doing

367
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,000
biology machine learning

368
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,720
nanotechnology and new materials and

369
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,920
even Quantum biology

370
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,600
can open a new horizon that we have

371
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,600
never seen before thank you for your

372
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,399
attention thank you for this Visionary

373
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:45,720
talk Ahad um we have time for maybe two

374
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,759
or three questions oh I need to stay up

375
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,519
there yeah I wish you would have more

376
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,839
time to hear the extended version of

377
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,759
your talk

378
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,759
yes any questions in the room

379
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,279
got to throw you a question about uh

380
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,120
what do you think is going to be the

381
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,560
biggest challenge to take this Vision

382
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,399
forward because it's a very exciting

383
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,800
Vision how much time do we have so okay

384
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,440
so I think uh the biggest challenge is

385
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,560
that and I'm realizing that the more I

386
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,680
spend time on it Healthcare and medical

387
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,519
is the most complex ecosystem I've ever

388
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,480
seen I mean if you think about

389
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,519
autonomous vehicles we need to work with

390
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,399
two groups of people tier one suppliers

391
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,360
and OEM car manufacturers and that

392
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:41,800
you're done in health you have to talk

393
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,600
to clinicians hospitals Pharma Labs

394
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,600
Medtech doctors and everybody should be

395
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,079
happy with the adoption of new

396
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,440
technology because it's not just about

397
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,600
technology so I see two major challenges

398
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,519
one of course we need to make sure that

399
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,440
our users or and customers acknowledge

400
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,759
and appreciate what we are doing

401
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,439
so we have two types of users here for

402
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,439
this technology one is Physicians and

403
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,839
clinicians that is a little bit more

404
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:09,839
straightforward because they have a set

405
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,120
of protocols if you go to your

406
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,799
cardiologist there are five biomarkers

407
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,720
they check in addition to your blood

408
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,439
pressure and then they prescribe things

409
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,120
now we can tell them okay we can do it

410
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,240
more frequently and we can close the

411
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,160
loop more intelligently like do and all

412
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,760
that the other part which is even more

413
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,559
interesting is scientists who come up

414
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,160
with the next drug or next dosage of the

415
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,000
drug and they want to monitor tons of

416
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,120
stuff like tens of thousands of proteins

417
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,760
and stuff so we need to make sure they

418
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,640
are in the loop from day one otherwise

419
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,200
we get into this cycle of I have a great

420
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,200
solution I don't know what problems I'm

421
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,520
solving so but then the other thing is

422
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,760
the

423
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,760
incentives you cannot change the

424
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,440
ecosystem you have work within ecosystem

425
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,559
but incentivize people to adopt it and I

426
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,600
think the good side so the question is

427
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,480
why it hasn't happened yet for two

428
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,760
reasons one technology the second one is

429
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,159
that now Healthcare the way it is is so

430
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,360
burdensome that cannot be sustainable

431
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,240
you cannot have 30% of GDP just on

432
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,960
Healthcare so something has to be done

433
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,640
so people have come to that realization

434
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,480
and personalized Healthcare everybody

435
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,760
admits is a way out of that have

436
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,840
multiple hands you decide who go maybe

437
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,080
one one more question because we are a

438
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,440
little short of time need to un move on

439
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,240
to my next

440
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,600
talk thank you so much Professor B so

441
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,640
one of the reasons that digital has been

442
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,440
scaling up is because of the abstraction

443
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,240
the year we talked a little bit about

444
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,360
that notion of digital twin earlier uh

445
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,039
I'm going to use an analog example in

446
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,960
semiconductor and I'll connect it to the

447
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,120
can you speak up a little bit yes can

448
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,679
you hear me now yeah so let's say you're

449
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,640
trying to build a simple analog circuit

450
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,480
you have to use H Spice in fact you can

451
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,360
use it do it without HS spice you can

452
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,039
take a model for

453
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,760
upamp which is which has infinite gain

454
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,280
and put it there and build your circuit

455
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,840
but if the same circuit is going to be

456
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,400
on a Hypersonic missile you're going to

457
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,919
have to use a different model for that

458
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,080
up because it it's exposed to a extreme

459
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,919
temperature so when we think about the

460
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,200
health you did talk about the modeling

461
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:18,760
aspect the personalization which is very

462
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,360
challenging it needs to be personalized

463
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,360
you're also looking at sort of a

464
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,720
multiscale modeling starting from

465
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,880
molecules going to tissues going to

466
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,840
organs so how do you think the

467
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,400
abstraction layer should be viewed here

468
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,679
to uh so that we can start building

469
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,679
feasible Solutions yeah I mean with my

470
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,480
limited knowledge about biology I don't

471
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,880
see any ways that you can have a Cadence

472
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,720
for biology I mean that is very

473
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,760
difficult and uh the reason for that is

474
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,200
unlike a typical semiconductor device

475
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,960
that we know where the electrons and

476
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,799
holes are and how they are traveling

477
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,280
across it's such a multi-dimensional

478
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,799
body in the yesterday's meeting one of

479
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:00,000
the questions was that how spirituality

480
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,919
impacts your health or meditation

481
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,799
I mean how your brain or mindset is

482
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,559
going to change our I mean there are

483
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,840
studies shows that I mean in fact I was

484
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,840
reading a paper in Scientific American

485
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,080
just a couple of days ago that five

486
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,400
minutes meditation every day can impact

487
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,640
almost every organ in the body how do I

488
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,960
model that so there are things in the

489
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,720
body that is extremely

490
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,720
complicated and the or or another

491
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,240
example I used yesterday that a tiny

492
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,440
Magneto stimulate in your ankle can

493
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,919
control your bladder I mean these things

494
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,880
are so complex in the body I think

495
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:41,080
abstraction needs to be at the level

496
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,200
that can add Insight but not uh intended

497
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:46,400
to be comprehensive because impossible

498
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,120
it's such a complex Machinery I mean

499
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,400
with all these billions of dollars on

500
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,520
brain study we barely know what the heck

501
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,880
is going on in our brain so there's so

502
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:58,720
many things now the beauty of that AI

503
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,080
with minimum physical model AI can deal

504
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,440
with unknowns and find correlations that

505
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,360
sometimes is amazing and sometimes very

506
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,480
insightful thank you so much thank you

507
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,480
thank you
