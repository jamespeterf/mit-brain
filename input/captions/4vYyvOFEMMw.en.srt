Hi, my name is Jen Barbara. I'm a part

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,359
of the admissions team at MIT Sloan.

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,400
When candidates apply to the Master of

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,400
Business Analytics program, we're

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,279
looking through your applications to see

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,080
evidence not only of academic strength,

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,320
especially from relevant coursework like

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,640
linear algebra, mathematics, computer

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,640
programming classes, but we're also

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,880
looking for leadership skills and

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,240
ability to collaborate with others.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,239
We're interested in seeing the things

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,399
that you get involved with while a

14
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,000
student during undergrad, this the

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,920
clubs, the organizations, the

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,399
competitions that you've been a part of.

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,879
We're also looking at your past work

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,360
experiences. If you've had internships

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,879
or have been working full-time, that's

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,800
really important for us to see that

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,039
you've been able to demonstrate success

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,680
in a professional capacity. We're

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,680
interested especially in experiences you

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,920
have that relate to data science,

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,079
analytics or you know business in

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,280

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,119
come to our program are also involved in

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,360

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,360
in hearing about how you've partnered

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,360

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,080

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,080
well.

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,840
The business analytics program is

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,920
differentiated from some of the other

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,880
programs that exist because of the

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,640
12month nature of the experience. You

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,119
have nine months of traditional

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,439
coursework that couples with a

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,840
seven-month capstone project, giving you

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,320
also 10 weeks of full-time experience

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,720
with a partner company during that final

43
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,360
summer semester. Students join this

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,280
program to learn from industry-leading

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,439
experts in optimization techniques and

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,920
advanced analytics and different

47
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,640
opportunities to partner with real world

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,680
problems that companies like Microsoft,

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,630
Nordstrom, Macy's all are facing each

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,849
day.
