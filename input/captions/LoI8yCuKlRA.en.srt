1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,720
thank you for introduction yeah Patrick

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,960
got sick so I'm replacing it but I can

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,679
do it well so my name is Hu I did my

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,799
master and PhD at MIT in mechanical

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,040
engineering and we spun out of MIT

6
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:17,320
around three years ago we are a

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,199
biomaterial based platform company uh

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,840
but today's problem we want to focus in

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,880
this event is a skin issue so skin is

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,160
the largest organ in the human body and

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,359
uh outermost barriers against many bad

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,359
things so therefore it experience a lots

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,239
of disease disas and conditions from

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,000
aema stasis to the scars and wounds and

15
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:39,879
sometimes chronic wounds if it is large

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,239
and a long-standing enough so our vision

17
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,719
is uh we are really want to make a kind

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,719
of synthetic extension of skin using our

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,800
Preparatory biomaterial thing that to

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,039
has a functional armor to protect

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,920
against those things those thing

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,359
including the dehydration pollution

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,480
infection UV and ederse mechanical

24
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,199
forces so it's basically we want to

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,640
replace something with a more neat and

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,640
nice and WAP around or bandages that is

27
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,880
out there already so our solution that

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,759
we have developed in MIT now we further

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,920
moved into the our company the more

30
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:14,600
commercial setup is a biod or sticky and

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,960
perceptible multi-functional armors

32
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,119
against all those aders factors we are

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,600
having a kit product with the patches

34
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,680
and a skin primers which is uh like a

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,360
moisturizer as well as a canic carrier

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,479
for therapeutic agents in it it is

37
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,079
adesive to the wet skin so it can be

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,400
actually applied on a whatever that

39
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,680
being applied on the skin it doesn't

40
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,560
need to be dry and clean it is soft and

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,680
elastic as the human skin and it's

42
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,439
transparent and it's having a physical

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,280
barrier as well as a mechanical

44
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,759
programmability so it actually can

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,000
contract in a programmed amount and

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,320
directions so how it works is we

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,119
developed this by inspired by some many

48
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,840
things including spider web glues and

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,479
you can see in this videos that is

50
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,799
really interesting in a way it looks

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,640
like a 3M tapes and dressings but it

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,360
actually can sticks to the skins that

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,680
are very wet or moisturized and it also

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,360
can contract in a desired directions and

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,319
amount is kind of programmable materials

56
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,160
so we have published in in a nice

57
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,599
journals because it's very interesting

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,640
Sciences but we are now looking into the

59
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,239
application of it because skin has a lot

60
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,040
of conditions uh this can be used in a

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,760
variety of different things including

62
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,319
the aema enclosur and scars and

63
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,239
chronicon and many of these application

64
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,000
we have done extensive preclinical

65
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,160
studies in academic and as well as

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,560
industrial setup after spinning out so

67
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,720
it is a large amount of opportunities

68
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,800
but one case that we really think it is

69
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,920
interesting is that we got approached by

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,480
uh the big cosmetic companies from South

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,159
Korea we did a contract R&D and it turns

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,680
out that our platform can actually

73
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,319
having an anti-aging applications by

74
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,440
having a mechanical modula ability uh by

75
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,920
adjusting a skin tension lines and all

76
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,440
those things you have anti- wrinkle

77
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,680
performances you know s ha per reduction

78
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,440
performances so we are trying to find

79
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,560
the way to commercialize in this

80
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,040
particular application with this partner

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,440
or some other partner in different

82
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,040
places but we also find out that this

83
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,360
can actually be really versatile

84
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,480
platform for various skin conditions and

85
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,920
diseases so what we are asking today is

86
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,400
essentially a partnership opportunities

87
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,000
uh we are a platform company that with

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,000
the many other programs but in

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,599
particular for this one we are looking

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,040
for both R&D level partnership for Coe

91
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,519
development into specific indications or

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,519
application area or also in commercial

93
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,959
state partnership such as licensing

94
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,080
mature product Supply we are both

95
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,920
looking for a potential Partners in know

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,799
medical such as Dermatology Advance

97
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,120
wound care area as well as consumer such

98
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,080
as Cosmetics we obviously interested in

99
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,519
a North American European market but

100
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,799
because especially for Cosmetics is very

101
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,640
big in Apec regions like China Korea

102
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,200
Japan we are also looking actively for

103
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,920
those areas as well so if you have any

104
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,280
question please ask us through either

105
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:02,239
either chat or in a breakout room thank

106
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:05,319
you thank you so much great great um so

107
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,360
um continuing on on that theme what um

108
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,720
where are you at as far as

109
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,879
commercialization and um the status of

110
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,480
santah Hill yeah so for this particular

111
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,600
platform we finished the R&D development

112
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,400
of the Technologies and we have a small

113
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,639
scale

114
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,400
manufacturability now we are at uh in

115
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,000
know finding a partner to actually

116
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,280
productizing this platform into specific

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,560
indications with the requirements and

118
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,639
specification and in parallel we are

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,880
working internally to make the

120
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,479
scalability of these manufacturing

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,800
processes because we understand that for

122
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,800
skin application generally volume and

123
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,440
the cost is a lot larger and the low

124
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,840
cost so that's where we are at and we

125
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,680
are the reason we are looking for

126
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,199
partner is many of these detailed

127
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,080
questions are quite geared to a specific

128
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,919
application areas that partner might be

129
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,479
interested fantastic and what is your

130
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:02,240
vision as you get these Partnerships

131
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:05,880
going where what's next yeah so because

132
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,199
we are more like R&D focused team and uh

133
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,960
because we have many different

134
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,759
applications we don't want to build

135
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,160
individual distribution and sales

136
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,440
channels and Etc so that's why we are

137
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,759
looking for a partnership for a product

138
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,120
development and also looking for a

139
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,759
specialized partner in specific intended

140
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,039
use cases that can take a chart take in

141
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,680
charge of the

142
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,919
commercialization uh instead of we are

143
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,160
been making a larg of distribution or

144
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:37,000
channels ourselves in various

145
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,000
applications okay fantastic thanks
