1
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Uh, and our next speaker is Mark Mezner

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,480
um from Endurance Energy and he's going

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,439
to talk about codes and standards for

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,519
geothermal heat pumps and uh networks.

5
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,920
>> Thank you. I got mine. I do have

6
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,559
Good morning and I want to thank Heat

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,640
and MIT for putting this meeting on. I

8
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,600
think it's absolutely vital that this

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,000
audience understands what is happening

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,160
now and where things are potentially

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,239
going. I'm going to talk to you about

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,360
the scintillating topic of codes and

13
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,960
standards. I'm sure you're on edge, but

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,840
they're they're good to to have. You

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,280
have to have standards. And just as a

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,680
note, a standard and a code actually,

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,600
but a standard in particular

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,159
lays out minimum standards. Okay? So

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,640
don't think this is the gold standard as

20
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,960
far as what you could do in a system.

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,880
Now that's up to a designer, engineer,

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,119
etc. These are the minimums that you

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,200
have to adhere to to be compliant to

24
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,000
this standard, which is the C448

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,799
standard, which is applicable in the

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
United States and Canada.

27
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,400
It actually worked. Excellent. Um, this

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,280
became a bational standard between

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,400
United States and Canada in 2016.

30
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,240
At that juncture, uh, it was a bit of a

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,439
milestone to get the two countries

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,640
actually to agree to things. So the the

33
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,759
background on that quickly was in 2014

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,840
is when the process started and we

35
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,200
gathered experts north and south of the

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,560
border approximately at that time 45 to

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,439
formulate the 2016 standard. Uh since

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,399
that time the standard has to go through

39
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,360
a a revision cycle. Unfortunately co

40
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,080
kind of hit and put a a pause on that.

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,120
So this should have been done in 2021 as

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,520
a new standard. It'll now be 2025. We

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,160
had to reaffirm this standard to allow

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,879
us to continue work on the new standard.

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,280
That new standard encompassed uh over 70

46
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,599
subject matter experts north and south

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,440
of the border as well as from Europe and

48
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,239
Asia.

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,680
Um there's a difference between a code

50
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,239
and a standard and I think it's

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,640
important that people understand that.

52
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,000
What they get mixed up. They think

53
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,760
they're all the same thing and they're

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,640
not. A standard is a voluntary set of

55
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,239
guidelines or prerequisites that you

56
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,000
adhere to. You can do it or not do it.

57
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,640
All right? You can say my system, my

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,440
geothermal system will be C448

59
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,040
compliant, which means you follow the

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,120
standard. You don't have to do that. In

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,800
Canada, I'll get to in a moment, you do.

62
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
In the United States, you don't. There's

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,040
a difference between the countries as we

64
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,239
all well know. Um however a standard can

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,200
become a code if the code body adopts

66
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:17,280
it. So as an example here in the US you

67
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,920
have uh code bodies like ICAMO

68
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,360
if they adopt this standard then it

69
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,239
becomes code basically becomes law. So

70
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,640
that's the genesis of how it works. And

71
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,879
again there's confusion out there but I

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,120
want to be clear that's kind of how this

73
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:37,280
works between a code and a standard.

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,920
quickly in Canada it's the C448 standard

75
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:45,200
and its various iterations before which

76
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,200
was C uh 445 C447 date back to 1992

77
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,519
and that's in the national building code

78
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,000
of Canada so in Canada we have one code

79
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,760
for the whole country and then that can

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,760
be modified province by province with

81
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,840
limitations you can only modify it so

82
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,799
far and that can be dropped down to the

83
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,840
city or municipal level as well so it's

84
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,760
bit of a different um approach between

85
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,840
Canada and United States. Uh if one of

86
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,479
the code bodies, like I say, like an

87
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,479
IATMO or IC adopts this code, then where

88
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,239
they have jurisdiction, it becomes quote

89
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,320
unquote the law of the land. And if

90
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,840
you're putting a geothermal system in

91
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,040
and either one of those bodies um adopt,

92
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,759
this is what you're going to quote

93
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,759
unquote have to do.

94
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,639
quickly. Um, we're not going to go

95
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,720
through all this because I got 10

96
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,400
minutes and h how much have I burned

97
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,040
through already? Too much. Okay. Uh,

98
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,440
what we did is is as a, uh, technical

99
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,160
committee, we gathered all of the

100
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,680
subject matter experts, um, that we

101
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,479
could, that we, you know, were

102
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,560
recommended to us, etc. Looked at the

103
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,080
2016 standard and said, "All right,

104
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,960
where are the gaps? Where are the

105
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,280
holes?" And there were. And the reason

106
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,360
why that happened is getting two

107
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,840
countries together to agree on something

108
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,720
is not easy as you can probably imagine.

109
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,600
So there was compromise accommodation

110
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,360
made in various areas and we lived with

111
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,320
that as an industry for that 5-year

112
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,120
period and then we identified wait a

113
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,360
second this has got to change. So there

114
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,680
was substantial changes done to the C448

115
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,520
standard. It will be published in May of

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,039
this year. So there's been some hiccups

117
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,960
along the road like I mentioned with

118
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:35,680
COVID etc. So it's a bit overdue is the

119
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,720
best way to say it.

120
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,880
Again, we uh worked with the EXPA

121
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,720
standards committee uh which by the way

122
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,240
I'm now the chair of so I don't think

123
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,880
it's a conflict of interest but I don't

124
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:52,479
know um to look at at their current

125
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,560
standard which was published in 2017

126
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,400
and technical committees went through

127
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,520
the standard of 2017 as well as the

128
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,319
bational standard of 2016 and say we

129
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,120
have to reconcile these two. What's

130
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,240
going to happen is once the 2025 edition

131
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,000
of C440 is published, the EXPA standard

132
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,160
gets sunset and there'll only be one

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,080
standard within the United States. Right

134
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,160
now there's kind of two, so it's a bit

135
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,880
awkward. The number of issues that we

136
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,080
went through that had to be relooked at

137
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,479
and uh expanded upon and more detail

138
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,479
given was what Garen was just talking

139
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,960
about was the formation thermal

140
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,520
conductivity testing. Thank you.

141
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,199
um as well as piping materials to have

142
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,199
absolute clarity on what you're putting

143
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,800
in the ground and more importantly what

144
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,840
you're not pardon me transfer fluids was

145
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,360
a a hot topic because when I'm talking

146
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,800
about heat transfer fluids that's the

147
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,080
fluid you're circulating through the

148
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,319
system and it could be just water it

149
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,240
depends on the design parameters a lot

150
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,360
of designers will put an antifreeze

151
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,520
agent into the system not so much to uh

152
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,759
combat freeze freezing from ambient, you

153
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,880
know, uh down 4 ft or whatever and you

154
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,280
had a really cold winter and you're

155
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,599
freezing the pipe. The real impetus is

156
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,080
to be able to run your heat pumps below

157
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,840
freezing. It's a bit of a combination,

158
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,240
but that's usually why people are doing

159
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,280
that. That's a whole design issue from a

160
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,599
designer. How cold do you want to run

161
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,319
your system? As Connor alluded to

162
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,520
earlier, um it depends, but usually your

163
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,520
parameters low are 30° Fahrenheit, high

164
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,440
about 90. Now, that's not written in

165
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,039
stone, but they're pretty good

166
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,599
goalposts.

167
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,440
Pardon me. The other one we looked at

168
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,319
very, very closely was hydrostatic

169
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,599
testing, and that's basically using a

170
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,160
fluid, water only, to pressurize and

171
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,800
test your system. If the system's

172
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,560
leaking because of a bad install, you

173
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,120
could be chasing it kind of quote

174
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,199
unquote forever. Where is the leak? So

175
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,400
you want to be doing a proper pressure

176
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,360
test prior to back filling because

177
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,840
imagine you have a bore field below a

178
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,680
40story building. You're not getting

179
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,800
back in there. So do it right the first

180
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,160
time. You have one chance.

181
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,599
I'm not going to go through this in too

182
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,879
much detail. The quick overview is there

183
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,680
is a general section which basically

184
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,960
encompasses a number of elements. One is

185
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,440
the all the the definitions that are in

186
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,160
the industry. So there's clarity. In a

187
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,319
lot of cases, you'll see the same item

188
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,360
referenced in two different ways

189
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,000
depending on a region. So we want to

190
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,640
clarify what those all are. So it's a

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,760
fairly exhaustive definition section

192
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,440
that um one should be looking at because

193
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,880
if you hear one term in Texas and it

194
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,800
could be something different in New

195
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,279
York. So we tried and did I think

196
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,600
successfully to capture all the

197
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,160
definitions and then use one throughout

198
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,200
the standard so there's no ambiguity.

199
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,640
That general section also included any

200
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,120
particular topic. So i.e. piping or heat

201
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,519
exchange fluid as examples that touched

202
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,040
on more of two source system

203
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,360
configurations.

204
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,240
They went into the general section so

205
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,240
there was no confusion. Then there was a

206
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,040
residential section focusing obviously

207
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,920
on single family homes, a commercial

208
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,040
section. There was a new section and

209
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:30,480
that's the district systems. Now a quick

210
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:33,440
segue, we're hearing gens, U10s, tens,

211
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:38,640
community loops, shared loops. There's a

212
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,640
whole bevy of terms out there.

213
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,120
We looked at it from a technical

214
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,200
committee side and went they're all

215
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,240
district systems. There are variations

216
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,959
to it. They are district systems and by

217
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,800
a definition you are servicing two or

218
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:58,000
more buildings with that system. So we

219
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,279
went into a lot of detail on a new

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,600
section for district energy system which

221
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,440
includes what you're all looking at is

222
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,360
ambient loop. It is one of the types of

223
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,200
district system. It's not the only one.

224
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,279
There's a number of them. Then after

225
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,240
that, we went into the various

226
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,399
configurations of source systems. What I

227
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,640
mean by that is the most prevalent one

228
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,200
out there is a vertically bore hole,

229
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,200
pardon me, vertically drilled bore hole.

230
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,000
So that's the vertical section and that

231
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,959
you'll find that in probably the

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,200
majority of commercial installs in urban

233
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,079
settings in particular. You'll see

234
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,040
horizontal systems, which was the next

235
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:44,320
one, where you have space. You have to

236
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,000
have a larger area land mass wise at the

237
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,880
surface to be able to put in a

238
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,279
horizontal system.

239
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,800
From there, we went into the the various

240
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,880
different types of source systems that

241
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,920
aren't that common, but are out there

242
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,480
depending on your geographic location

243
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,760
and your geology. So surface water

244
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,959
systems are basically looking at a lake,

245
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,680
a river, the ocean. So that's a source

246
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:13,760
system. We went through all of them that

247
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,399
are currently out there. Excuse me. Um,

248
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,240
groundwater systems are open systems.

249
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,720
You've probably heard the term pump and

250
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,320
dump. Maybe you have, maybe you haven't.

251
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,160
That's where you have a water well.

252
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,000
Basically, you're extracting water,

253
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,959
running it through a heat exchanger, and

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,320
then reinjecting that to the aquifer or

255
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,839
to surface depending on what the

256
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:38,959
jurisdiction allows. Um, standing column

257
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,480
well is is a um it's a bit of a niche

258
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,720
because you have to have competent

259
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,680
bedrock to be able to put them in. It's

260
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,240
it's very specialized here in the

261
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,680
Northeast. They're prevalent. Not so

262
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,079
much in the rest of the continent

263
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,240
reality. The new one that we put in that

264
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,800
was coming up is uh for um foundations

265
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,360
or energy piles. They're getting some

266
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,480
traction. We said we got to put this in

267
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,720
there, address it, and have a standard

268
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,519
around it.

269
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,440
There's informative annexes at the back

270
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,920
of the standard. These are not

271
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,839
mandatory. These are information. That's

272
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,440
why they're called informative annex. So

273
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:24,079
they give you um direction on things and

274
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,880
the new one was for wastewater energy

275
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,560
transfer. You've heard I think Nick was

276
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,880
talking about it. I think Connor maybe a

277
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,959
little bit. The Shark system is one.

278
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,680
There's different uh Hoover out of

279
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,360
Germany has them. There are pipe systems

280
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,079
and you're harvesting thermal energy

281
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,440
from your wastewater stream. So again,

282
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,920
we thought it was very important to put

283
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,160
that in. I am going to skip over this

284
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,279
because zero minutes. Oh well, that

285
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,920
means I'm done. Is that what you're

286
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,720
telling me? Uh, okay. Hang on. Let's get

287
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,120
get to Can I have two more minutes? I'll

288
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,040
talk real fast.

289
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,360
>> Okay. Thank you. Uh, back one. Uh,

290
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,360
piping. Okay. One of the big issues

291
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,519
there is what are you putting into the

292
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,200
ground? It's vitally important that

293
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,399
we're not putting garden hose down a

294
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,040
bore hole. So, in a standard, you tend

295
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,120
to be performanceoriented. Meet this

296
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,000
performance metric and you are

297
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,600
compliant. There are issues where it has

298
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,600
to be prescriptive. It it's kind of a

299
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,040
there's no way out of that one. We have

300
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,600
to be very careful in what we're putting

301
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,040
in to a bore hole. Bearing in mind we

302
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,360
are putting in infrastructure that's

303
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,440
going to last 50, 100 years, 150. We

304
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,320
don't even know. So what you're putting

305
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,959
in the ground has got to last. Sorry I'm

306
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,639
talking fast. Oh, that last thing. PVC

307
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:44,320
CPVC

308
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,560
no longer will be uh compliant with the

309
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,000
standard. A lot of testing, a lot of

310
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:54,240
research was done on PVC in particular.

311
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,399
And heat exchange fluids within PVC are

312
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,160
basically corrosive is the best way to

313
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,480
say it. They break down and you have

314
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,720
real problems. Again, infrastructure,

315
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,920
we're not doing that. I'll skip over

316
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,800
that. Heat exchange fluids. Um, a lot of

317
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,360
work went into this. What's available?

318
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,120
What can you do? There's tables in there

319
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,600
that give you properties of heat

320
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,920
transfer fluids. again for a designer to

321
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,760
choose what is the applicable heat

322
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,240
transfer fluid and may just be water.

323
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,839
That's quite possible. Pressure testing,

324
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,000
like I said, I'm not going to belabor

325
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,680
this one because I'm out of time. The

326
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,480
integrity of the ground loop system is

327
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,880
paramount. You have to be able to say

328
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,480
this is not leaking before you back

329
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,639
fill. Otherwise, you have huge problems.

330
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,040
That is a quick that's what an energy

331
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,800
pile looks like. It's a bit of a new um

332
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,720
approach to a source system. They're

333
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,639
gaining some traction. They are

334
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:54,240
applicable in some cases, not all cases.

335
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,160
The whole district energy systems um

336
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,160
many many people have been talking about

337
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,920
the various source inputs that you could

338
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:06,079
have to a district system. So we have

339
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,560
went fairly exhaustive on that and

340
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,320
deviated a bit from the format that is

341
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,560
currently within the rest of the

342
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,839
standard and that's under number four

343
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,839
pro project planning is you know as a

344
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,920
designer you're doing a district energy

345
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,360
system. These are some vital elements

346
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,800
you have to look at which are applicable

347
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,079
to gen, you know, generally to

348
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,959
geothermal systems, but really take a a

349
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,279
u a good look for a district system.

350
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,839
There's lots of moving parts and you

351
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,360
have to be um cognizant of what is out

352
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,120
there. Uh piping materials, again I said

353
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,680
very prescriptive on the piping

354
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:48,160
materials. This one here is for the

355
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,440
distribution materials inside or uh

356
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,199
above grade I should say of for district

357
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,199
systems. So there it's a little bit of a

358
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,600
deviation from what's in the ground

359
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,880
because there's more flexibility given

360
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,480
your different source systems and

361
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,959
temperatures.

362
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,199
Uh I think it was alluded to earlier

363
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,360
depending on how the system is being

364
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,680
designed. You may have insulated or

365
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,680
pre-insulated piping, hot pipe, cold

366
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,959
pipe. You got to be careful there. that

367
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,519
you're not having thermal interference

368
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:19,519
between the two. Insulation in a con

369
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:22,160
confined area is your best go. Uh energy

370
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,160
transfer stations. I believe Brian Erlab

371
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,480
touched upon that. That's one way of

372
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,399
isolating your system uh your ground

373
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,800
loop system from the building. And

374
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,000
that's the waste water. Again, the these

375
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,880
are uh informative annexes to say here's

376
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,560
what you could do. Uh you can do a pipe

377
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,519
as you can see on the left there. That's

378
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,240
another way of harvesting uh energy from

379
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,800
the wastewater stream. This is some of

380
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,680
the investigation we did. There's not a

381
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,399
lot of um information from a standards

382
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,759
point of view in North America. So, we

383
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,759
referenced a a German uh specification

384
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,120
to get some guidance. They've done a lot

385
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,000
of work. We're not going to reinvent the

386
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,919
wheel. This is the the timeline. Like I

387
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,760
say, the last bullet is what we're

388
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,880
looking at. Release at May 2025.

389
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,319
Uh that's just a quick overview of you

390
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,000
know sunsetting the standards from

391
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,439
EXGPA. Uh any standard is a bit of a

392
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,360
living document. There's a revision

393
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,360
cycle every 5 years. However, should

394
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,559
there be some monumental change within

395
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,600
the industry, there is the ability to do

396
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,679
a an update or NARTA. Uh looking at

397
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,840
things into the future, the A2L

398
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,080
refrigerants will be a big issue.

399
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,880
District energy systems will continue to

400
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:43,320
be on everyone's mind. And that's about

401
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,320
it. So, sorry, Stacey.
