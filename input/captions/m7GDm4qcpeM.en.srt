1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
First, there were hunters and gatherers.

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,960
Everyone contributed and their business

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,200
was basically to survive. Eventually,

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,880
people began to tame plants and animals,

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,120
allowing for larger and larger

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,519
settlements. This opened up new kinds of

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,760
work. Then, industrial and capitalist

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,520
revolutions changed everything. The

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,920
development of computers, the worldwide

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,160
web, and widespread education ushered us

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,080
into the knowledge-based economy. As

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,320
fewer people and fewer hours are needed

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,960
to do the work of yesterday, people are

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,360
adapting again. How you live and work

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,960
will invent the future. You'll rely on

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,440
your networks and connections to help

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,120
you out, and you'll help others, too.

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,719
Maybe you'll specialize in something no

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,320
one has thought of before. Maybe you'll

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,399
make your voice heard among those who

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,960
find themselves excluded from today's

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,719
economy. So, keep on working, creating,

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,719
and inventing the future of work.
