1
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,359
let me first start with some

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,760
Administration so actually some of you

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:24,880
noticed that the pet problem number

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:28,840
2B there's a slight problem I posted a

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,519
comment about this in the website uh and

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,320
I'm going to so there's an assumption I

7
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,559
want you to make for problem Tob just

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,399
look at the website and the announcement

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,840
if you have any questions come to me

10
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,800
okay so that's one thing the other thing

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,039
is uh in uh not well next week is

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,199
Thanksgiving so Happy Thanksgiving and

13
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:50,079
uh the week after I'm actually away

14
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,719
giving some kinot talk but we're gonna

15
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,280
actually it worked out really well

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:59,079
because uh the topic of that lecture is

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,719
going to be about what's called bargs or

18
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,160
batch arguments

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,960
uh that would lead us kind of in the

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,720
final class to get kind of our snars

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:11,759
that we were kind of you know building

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:17,119
for and that lecture is covers a work by

23
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:20,960
three authors Jane jyn uh uh

24
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,000
um korti Jane and Jin and Jen Jung Jin

25
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,520
is Gonna Come here and present the

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,479
results so you'll get the author kind of

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,799
presenting the relevant work and then

28
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,079
the final class will'll kind of wrap

29
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:32,240
everything up and show you how to get

30
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:35,320
kind of the what we work for this entire

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,640
semester okay so just kind of what we're

32
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,159
going to focus on uh for today so any

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,000
questions about Administration about

34
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:44,680
questions from last class anything

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,680
before we kind of go into the

36
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:49,920
material

37
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,360
yeah when doing the homework I realiz

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,320
one thing I'm not sure like something

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,360
change with GK GK only has like the ad

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,479
and the M case right but there's no is

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,039
there way to get subtraction

42
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,399
work so let's talk come to me after

43
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:09,360
class okay okay uh okay any any other

44
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,480
questions I'll talk about this after

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,080
class okay so what's uh what's the the

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,800
plan for today or where we kind of left

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,840
off last class and what we're heading

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,920
for uh today so last class we defined

49
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,599
kind of the phir Paradigm so kind of

50
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,480
from the beginning what did we do we

51
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:29,640
showed kind of this kind of interactive

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,560
protocols and then we showed like uh

53
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,360
from example gkr which is only for bound

54
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,959
to depth computations then we showed you

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,560
can build from that a PCP and then use

56
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,040
that PCP to kind of shrink it using

57
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,519
cryptography and get actually for

58
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,040
message that was the kilan mikali

59
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,959
protocol for message protocol proofs or

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,760
arguments computationally sound proofs

61
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,360
for all of NP where it's very succinct

62
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,599
okay so you can kind of take any witness

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,519
for NP and instead of sending this

64
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,000
witness which is long I don't know ply n

65
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,799
Bits I'm going to shrink it to kind of

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,440
via an interactive protocols so four

67
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,480
messages to get it kind of the number of

68
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,120
bit is proportional to the security

69
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,200
parameter which can be much much smaller

70
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,799
so that's what we showed that was the

71
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,239
kilan mikali protocol but that was four

72
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,879
messages so now we're kind of towards

73
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,080
the home stretch we want to kind of get

74
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,480
around these four messages and reduce it

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,480
down to just one message so how do we do

76
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,519
that so last class we defined this uh uh

77
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,159
Paradigm called the fimir Paradigm it

78
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,760
was introduced exactly for this purpose

79
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,920
to kind of eliminate Interra inter

80
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,080
eliminate interaction from interactive

81
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,439
protocols uh so by essentially replacing

82
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,080
the verifier with a hash

83
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:44,680
function and now there was a question

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,840
it's a very nice very simple very

85
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,319
efficient kind of Paradigm very elegant

86
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,720
in my opinion but then there's the

87
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,640
question is it sound if you start with

88
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,720
an interactive protocol that you can

89
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,720
prove soundness when you apply the pH

90
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,680
Paradigm is the protocol or the proof

91
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,239
still sound that's the question and uh

92
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,519
what we proved for for this protocol Kil

93
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,280
meali protocol is it is sound if you

94
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,280
apply the F Paradigm but if you this

95
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,840
hash function is kind of what's like uh

96
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,959
is a random Oracle so instead of being

97
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,720
actually an explicit kind of circuit if

98
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,479
we think of it as a completely random

99
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,160
function that both parties have Oracle

100
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,199
access to then it's sound but in real

101
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,800
world there's there's no kind of random

102
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,040
Oracles in the sky that all parties have

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,479
access to we actually use specific

104
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,479
circuits uh to replace this hash

105
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:32,160
function

106
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,919
and then there was uh kind of this

107
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,000
question of when we actually use the F

108
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:40,400
Paradigm with with a specific circuit

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,120
with a specific uh hash that's

110
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,080
computable by specific kind of circuit

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,560
is it

112
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,000
sound okay and that was kind of open for

113
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,759
a long time it was a very very important

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,919
open problem because fut is viewed all

115
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,560
over the place in practice so kind of

116
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,280
understanding whether it's secure or not

117
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,639
is very important and we had we could

118
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,160
only analyze it in the random Oracle

119
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,680
model so now not in real world uh

120
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,800
settings and as I pointed out last time

121
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,759
there the random Oracle model actually

122
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,600
worked out to be a very good proxy so

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,880
none of the schemes in practice actually

124
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,320
that we proved Security in the random

125
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,320
Oracle model turned out to be broken so

126
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,360
turns out it's a very very good proxy

127
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,759
for

128
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,160
security but still kind of at least for

129
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,800
me as a theoretician I want to

130
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,800
understand kind of why you know when we

131
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,199
replace it with an actual function an

132
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,720
actual program why is it secure

133
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,280
so uh and frankly I still don't

134
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,039
understand why it's such a good proxy I

135
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,479
have to say it's still kind of it's

136
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:41,000
surprising to me that never ever we had

137
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,000
like it's really really kind of

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,520
approximates you know Security in to

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,319
Good Very uh very well even though as I

140
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,120
mentioned we do have counter examples we

141
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,160
do have examples contrived not real

142
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,360
world examples but contrived examples

143
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,000
where the protocol are secure in the

144
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,360
random morical model and not secure in

145
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,319
you know um when applied F and actually

146
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,120
interestingly Kean mik is one of them

147
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,440
it's actually one of the protocols where

148
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:13,240
actually it was proven that if you use a

149
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,520
certain hash function Collision

150
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,680
resistant but certain hash function then

151
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,360
actually you can prove security if no

152
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,120
matter which specific function you use

153
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,960
for the it will for the uh for the

154
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,199
function it will not be secure but this

155
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,080
specific hash function which is

156
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,680
Collision resistant is contrived so we

157
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,840
still don't have kind of real world

158
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,120
natural application of where security

159
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,400
was proven in the random Oracle model

160
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,440
but turned out to be false in the in the

161
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,000
real

162
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,440
world okay so uh so so kind of that's

163
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,680
where we're heading to okay trying to

164
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,880
prove the security of or the soundness

165
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,960
of the F uh Paradigm and kind of along

166
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,879
the way what we did is I defined a

167
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,639
certain protocol uh which is zero know

168
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,599
so we kind of took a detour talked about

169
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,120
zero knowledge and we looked at a spefic

170
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,720
specific protocol zero knowledge

171
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,599
protocol for graph uh for hamiltonicity

172
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,720
for hamilt whether a graph has a

173
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:11,960
hamiltonian cycle or not that's an NP

174
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,400
complete problem and so here's just a

175
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,960
recap because we'll look at it again

176
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,680
today so here's a proof and three three

177
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,440
message uh proof system the prover is

178
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,840
trying to prove to the verifier that a

179
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,599
graph G has a hamiltonian cycle and we

180
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,840
want to do it in zero knowledge so in a

181
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:31,720
proof that gives no information and the

182
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,479
way we did it we said okay the prover so

183
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,000
the prover has the hamiltonian cycle he

184
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,240
does not want to reveal any information

185
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,720
about this hamiltonian cycle to the

186
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,479
verifier what would the prover do he

187
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,879
will choose a random permutation

188
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:49,639
Pi he will commit kind of put in a safe

189
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:54,800
locked safe uh only the hamiltonian

190
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:57,240
cycle of Pi of G so if C is the kind of

191
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,000
the path the Honan cycle in G he will

192
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,759
compute Pi of the cycle okay to the

193
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,159
cycle inside Pi of

194
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,759
G and then he's going to get a random

195
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:11,039
bit and he's going to give an answer

196
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,479
what is the answer if the bit is zero

197
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,479
he's just going to open the

198
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,599
cycle uh he's just gonna open uh the

199
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:24,479
cycle okay so or maybe I should say like

200
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,560
Pi of C so he's going to open only the

201
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,080
places where where there's a where uh

202
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,919
there's a cycle and the guy's going to

203
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,880
check that yes it's an indeed

204
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:34,120
cycle okay but we need to make sure that

205
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,880
the cycle has something to do with the

206
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:42,479
graph itself so if the B is one then we

207
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:44,760
check that indeed that you you give the

208
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,320
permutation you do not give the permuted

209
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,839
cycle otherwise you'll give information

210
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:54,120
so you only give them the permutation

211
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:57,519
and you open only non edges in pi of G

212
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,640
so now you know everywhere in pi of G

213
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,000
that there's no Edge in the this

214
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,880
commitment there's no

215
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,640
edges okay so again let me just

216
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,000
emphasize to recap this commitment you

217
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,959
should it's committing to n if n is the

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,560
number of nodes in the graph it's

219
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,160
committing to N squared values where

220
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,079
there's a one if there's an edge zero if

221
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,680
there's not an edge okay for any i j it

222
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:22,760
says zero or one whether it's an edge or

223
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,760
not an edge and when we if B equals zero

224
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,880
we only open kind of the places where

225
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,480
there's a hamiltonian cycle we check

226
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,880
that everything there should be one and

227
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,279
you check that it kind of closes that it

228
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,720
corresponds to a cycle and if B equals 1

229
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,279
you give the entire permutation and you

230
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,640
open the non-edges

231
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,800
okay and now the claim was that this is

232
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,360
indeed zero knowledge and the intuition

233
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,640
was well if you open zero he doesn't

234
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,959
learn anything because he just gets a

235
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,240
random cycle has nothing to do with the

236
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,360
graph just any random cycle that's what

237
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,720
he sees okay he could have generated

238
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,839
there no information about the graph and

239
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,360
if he gets b equals 1 then what does he

240
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,320
see a random permutation and a bunch of

241
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,320
openings of zero that's no information

242
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,399
and as we said the soundness here is

243
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,760
only half that's the problem for only

244
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,519
half you can cheat because if you

245
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,519
guessed a cheating improver I can guess

246
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,880
B and if I guess b c if I guess B I can

247
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:18,360
at least cheat on that b so I can always

248
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,720
kind of even if G doesn't have a

249
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,399
hamiltonian cycle I can always answer

250
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,120
correctly on one of them but not

251
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,480
both so if I guess your P I can answer I

252
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,040
can cheat you so this gives only

253
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,760
soundness half okay this is just a recap

254
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,120
and that was kind of I motivated this

255
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,920
kind of show that this is not even

256
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,279
secure in the random oracal model so

257
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,920
actually to get Security even in the

258
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,839
random Oracle model you need to repeat

259
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,240
in

260
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,839
parallel so today we're going to cons

261
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:51,000
when I say now PV like uh this so when I

262
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,800
say like the protocol PV let me think of

263
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,360
I'm I want you to throughout this class

264
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,600
let think of it is parallel repetition

265
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,600
of this

266
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,040
with like secur security parameter

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,320
Lambda copies okay so now I mean sound s

268
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,839
is really not good for us that's not

269
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,720
what we want so think of it that we

270
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,600
repeat this in parallel security

271
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,279
parameter number of times okay so in

272
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,040
other words the prover Lambda number of

273
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,560
times each time chooses a fresh

274
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,600
permutation

275
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,639
Pi commits so he does this Lambda times

276
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,399
each time with a new permutation Pi this

277
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,040
is very important and people see why

278
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,160
it's important that the per

279
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,760
ation it's fresh each time if you use

280
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,720
the same permutation and you open b0 B1

281
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,399
you learn

282
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,399
everything so each time you give a fresh

283
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,600
kind of random permutation you send in

284
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,480
Lambda times you get a B for each one

285
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,880
and now you send a message for each

286
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,680
one okay so that was the protocol now

287
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,200
there's now we Pro that it's secure in

288
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,279
the random Orco model actually we proved

289
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,639
that any

290
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,399
cound protocol that has negligible

291
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,160
soundness is secure in the random

292
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,279
morical model we showed that last time

293
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,440
so it's secure in the random morical

294
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:11,079
model and now there's the question okay

295
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,519
is it secure in the standard model when

296
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,519
we use

297
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,199
F and what we're going to show today is

298
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,839
yes it is secure so that's kind of the

299
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:22,880
first thing we're going to show that

300
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,920
this protocol pnv and again when I say

301
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,440
p&v throughout today's class it's a

302
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,279
parall repeated version okay so we're

303
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,160
going to show that PV are C when you

304
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:35,959
apply F in the standard model okay for

305
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,440
some commitment not every commitment so

306
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,440
we'll open this box a little bit and

307
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,880
show that there exists a a very natural

308
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,399
commitment scheme that with that

309
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,760
commitment scheme we can argue that this

310
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,440
is secure when the hash function will

311
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,199
actually construct a hash function I'll

312
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,720
give you an exact hash function and say

313
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:54,800
if you use this hash function for the

314
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,920
you'll get security or

315
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,399
soundness okay but this hash function to

316
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,040
argue you'll need to assume something

317
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:03,079
about the hatch I mean you'll need to

318
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,279
this hatch function assumes some

319
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,320
cryptography and the cryptography it

320
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,199
assumes is the existence of a fully

321
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,360
homomorphic encryption I'll Define what

322
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:14,000
that is but not just a fully homomorphic

323
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,839
encryption we'll assume also that it's

324
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,720
circular secure fully homomorphic

325
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,800
encryption I'll Define what that is as

326
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,120
well I just want to say actually today

327
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,360
we don't need the circular secure

328
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,240
version we know how to get rid of it but

329
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,199
what I'm going to explain today does use

330
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,920
this version It's just simpler okay and

331
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:32,959
this can be uh this we believe this is

332
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,160
true there's instantiation based on

333
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,320
circular secure learning with air lwe

334
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,519
but we don't need to get into these

335
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,880
details okay so that's what we're going

336
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,639
to do in the uh first part of the class

337
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,079
and the second part of the class so now

338
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,040
you can say okay let's say we Pro F why

339
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,360
am I obsessed with this protocol andless

340
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,160
Pro f for this protocol so what like why

341
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,800
why is that why should you be engaged so

342
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,920
let me try to give you motivation for

343
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,000
you to stay awake and listen to me so

344
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,120
why is it so this protocol in particular

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,680
is so is very important why

346
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,199
so what I'm going to show is when you

347
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,079
apply F chamir to this protocol you get

348
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:13,519
what's called a noninteractive zero

349
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:16,600
knowledge proof niic for short so uh we

350
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,959
get once we we do that for this protocol

351
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,839
because it was Zero knowledge we can

352
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:22,199
argue that when you apply F you get

353
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,759
non-interactive zero knowledge and to

354
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,720
get noninteractive zero knowledge based

355
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:29,199
on lates was a open question for a very

356
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,759
very long time and this was resolved in

357
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,880
this paper that I'm going to present in

358
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:37,880
this work that I'm going to present you

359
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,720
by ketti Lombardi and uh Wix so kind of

360
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,639
the one of the motivating examples is

361
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,639
that we get this non-interactive zero

362
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:47,360
knowledge that's one but the other

363
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,519
motivating example is that actually this

364
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,519
technique is much more General okay the

365
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,560
technique of F that that I'm going to

366
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,279
show you is much more General than just

367
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,399
for this protocol actually it's a very

368
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,680
general technique that can be used for

369
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,720
many protocols and in particular we used

370
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,320
it later this exact technique and I'm

371
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,120
going to try to show you how we can how

372
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,680
it can be used to get uh to show that

373
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,240
the GK protocol that we studied in the

374
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,959
beginning actually is secure in the

375
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:17,000
standard model uh in uh when you apply

376
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:19,480
Fu to it you get security under learning

377
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,399
with air or FHA again as I mentioned the

378
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,240
circle of security can be prevented I'm

379
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,560
just showing you the result I uses it

380
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,440
for Simplicity okay so so it's not just

381
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,399
for for this protocol to get n it you

382
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,399
can actually use to get snars and

383
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,399
moreover what you'll see uh after

384
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,079
Thanksgiving that Jang Jong is going to

385
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,399
present he's going to use this exact

386
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:44,639
same tool to get uh batch Arguments for

387
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:48,240
NP so this kind of is baked into all our

388
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,079
our results almost okay so it's very

389
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,079
it's actually very general and

390
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,079
nice

391
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,079
yes like relate

392
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,240
to because last uh last time we like a

393
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:03,759
little bit over the result of w bar

394
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,319
about the fact I can't have great

395
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,720
question great great great question okay

396
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:09,800
let me let me review your question

397
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,360
because you have a great question so

398
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,600
last time I kind of showed you that

399
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,199
there's actually a tension if you have

400
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,160
an interactive proof that is zero

401
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,440
knowledge then I kind of gave you this

402
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,959
high level intuition that if it is

403
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,399
really zero knowledge you cannot apply

404
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:30,040
fimir to it it will

405
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,040
fail and and here I'm saying oh we're

406
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,720
going to apply F to it and not only that

407
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,720
we're going to get zero knowledge not

408
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,360
interative zero knowledge like wait wait

409
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,959
wait wait wait last time you said you

410
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,040
can't get zero knowledge now you say

411
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,639
this I'm kind of contradicting myself

412
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,920
here okay so again let me repeat it just

413
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,160
to make sure we're all on board last

414
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,120
time I said a protocol that is zero

415
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,839
knowledge cannot be F

416
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,880
secure now I'm saying guess what this

417
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,800
protocol is fair to me

418
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,199
secure okay so first of all

419
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,160
indeed I have no reason to believe that

420
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,240
this protocol is when you repeat it in

421
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,400
parallel that it's zero knowledge we

422
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,439
know that it's zero knowledge if and the

423
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,480
probability H in without parallel

424
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:18,839
paration we know that it's zero

425
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,480
knowledge if you repeat it sequentially

426
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,959
if you repeat it in parallel we don't

427
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,000
know that it's zero knowledge

428
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:27,000
anymore that's first second so now

429
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,600
you're saying next thing you can say is

430
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,280
oh so now we know that it's not zero

431
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,200
knowledge

432
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,360
almost almost actually the result does

433
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,720
show that Peril repetition does not

434
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,360
preserve zero knowledge but actually

435
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,120
it's not going to be completely because

436
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,640
I'm going to change the commitment in a

437
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,919
way that you'll see in a minute so not

438
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,240
quite but then you can say okay but how

439
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,080
do you get niic out of it how do you get

440
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,640
none it seems completely opposite

441
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,840
because I just said f is in

442
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,600
contradictory of of zero knowledge and

443
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,960
not you apply F and you get zero

444
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,880
knowledge

445
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,960
knowled okay so what we get is non

446
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,840
interactive zero knowledge and

447
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,919
non-interactive zero knowledge the

448
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,679
simulator I I didn't Define what it is

449
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:17,520
so it's hard I'll explain it as I go but

450
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:20,080
the simulator has more power than the

451
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,960
cheating prover remember if the way the

452
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,000
reason I said that if you have a zero

453
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,760
knowledge protocol why can't you apply

454
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,600
fat because we said look the verifier

455
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,400
can a cheting verifier can use the F

456
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,679
chir function he can behave maliciously

457
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,880
he's behaving with the F chir function

458
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,039
now you should be able to simulate The

459
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,320
View so if you have an efficient

460
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,919
simulator that simulates the view for X

461
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,600
in the language he can't he's an

462
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,000
efficient simulator he doesn't know what

463
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
which instances are in the language or

464
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,360
outside the language it's NP it's hard

465
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,440
languages so he probably will succeed in

466
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,600
simulating the view of instances outside

467
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,120
the language otherwise he's like a p you

468
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,039
know he's a kind of

469
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,840
distinguisher you can use him to show

470
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,679
that the language is an in not an NP so

471
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,360
he you know so so and that's why there

472
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,440
cannot be a simulator because the

473
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,559
simulator he can act like a cheating

474
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,720
prover in the non-interactive setting he

475
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,559
cannot because we're giving the

476
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,039
simulator extra power to choose the

477
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,080
common reference stram we'll talk about

478
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:22,640
it when we get there but it's a model

479
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,360
that's a little different so actually I

480
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,320
planned I'm going to talk about this

481
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,960
more in length when I get there but

482
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,120
since you asked I want to to give a

483
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,559
preview so indeed there's tension and

484
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,520
we'll see how to overcome it it's

485
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,799
actually really interesting that kind of

486
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,159
uh you know uh that it's a belief that

487
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:41,960
you can't get

488
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:44,240
use once zero knowledge is in kind of in

489
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,880
contradiction to but actually we use to

490
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,039
get the non-interactive version of zero

491
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,039
knowledge but we we'll go into detail

492
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,720
when we get there great question a any

493
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,520
any other

494
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,760
questions so my plan next is to prove

495
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,240
the secure the sound of this protocol

496
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,480
the Peril repeated version under F but

497
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,480
any question before we go

498
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:14,640
there okay so let's I I let the the

499
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:19,280
result so as I said this is a result of

500
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:23,360
a ketti lombardian weeks from

501
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,880
2019 it's so beautiful and simple so

502
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,760
this was an open question for a very

503
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,120
long time uh and we I I want to give it

504
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,840
to you as a kind of a evidence or an

505
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,400
example of something that we thought was

506
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,280
so hard so hard so hard and then comes

507
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,520
if you just think about it like a little

508
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,960
differently you twist a little bit it's

509
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,760
so easy

510
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,640
so I want I'm G to have you guys try to

511
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,640
come up with a proof okay of this so

512
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,760
let's try to do it interactively and I

513
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,320
want you to prove to me that this

514
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,400
protocol PV but think of it again par

515
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,159
repeated and in parallel it

516
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,320
sound okay so I'm going to give you a

517
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,280
few hints and we'll get there together

518
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,799
okay so one thing that's really nice

519
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,600
about this

520
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:10,559
protocol is uh so okay I want to argue

521
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,080
okay I want when we let's recall what is

522
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,919
the F chamir Paradigm the F chamir

523
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,760
Paradigm says that you know we choose

524
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:22,360
some hash function some hash key

525
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,760
from you know there's some f hash

526
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:27,200
function that generates a hash ke and

527
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,960
now we want to say Let Let Me denote for

528
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Simplicity this kind of these messages

529
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,559
by alpha beta and gamma okay even for

530
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,559
now let's even not think of this

531
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,320
specific protocol okay let's think of

532
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:43,840
just a protocol the prover sends Alpha

533
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,640
verifier sends beta prover sends gamma

534
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,520
okay even don't let's not even go into

535
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,640
the specific details I want to prove to

536
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,960
come up with a hash function so I want

537
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,039
to come up with a hash function H which

538
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,279
you know generates a key for a hash and

539
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:00,000
then

540
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:03,840
evaluates that's just a hash

541
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,240
function such that this remains sound

542
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,840
okay so I have this there's some NP

543
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,200
language X I want to prove whether it's

544
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,799
in the language or not this is my proof

545
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,240
system and I want to find a hash

546
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:17,400
function for which is

547
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,039
sound so what does this at first it

548
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,120
seems like it should be very easy why

549
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,120
should it be very easy look take let's

550
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,640
say x not in the language we need to

551
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,520
focus on X not in the language X in the

552
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,279
language it's complete like completeness

553
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,600
that's easy I you cannot cheat okay so

554
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:34,320
now what do I need to say I say let I

555
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,760
want that for any X on the language so

556
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,440
fix One X on the language I want to

557
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:44,039
argue that you cannot find an

558
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,840
alpha and beta which is H of Alpha and

559
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:49,120
the gamma that's

560
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,840
accepting but now this is a proof system

561
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,559
so every Alpha has very few betas for

562
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,640
which there even exists a GMA that's

563
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:00,799
accepting right so again because it's f

564
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,760
X the language first thing we notice

565
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:06,640
just by definition of a proof that for

566
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,520
every Alpha any possible Alpha there

567
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,440
exists very few betas for which there

568
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:16,200
exists an accepting answer so there

569
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:21,559
exists few very few

570
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:26,240
betas such that there exists

571
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:29,240
gamma for which Alpha Beta gamma are

572
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,240
accepted

573
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,919
okay so that's the first thing we notice

574
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,799
because it's a proof system by the

575
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,640
virtue of a proof system for every Alpha

576
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:43,320
there are very very few actually not in

577
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:46,200
this protocol specifically there's one

578
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,799
one because

579
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,080
if the graph G does not have a

580
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,559
hamiltonian

581
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,159
cycle take a cheating Pro the gener

582
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,760
sends alpha alpha is a bunch of

583
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:00,039
commitments now let's actually each

584
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,159
commitment look either they're sitting

585
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:05,440
aonian cycle or

586
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,919
not you can't answer both questions we

587
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,159
know that if you can answer both

588
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:10,440
questions well it won't be sound so you

589
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:13,840
can only answer one question and each

590
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,679
one can only answer one so this protocol

591
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,240
it's even for this specific protocol

592
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,799
let's assume even let let me be let's

593
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,640
even

594
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:24,880
assume what what any proof tells you is

595
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,399
that for every Alpha there exist a few

596
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,520
but you know let's for Simplicity

597
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:30,120
because that's the protocol we're

598
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,679
dealing with

599
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,320
let's

600
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,880
Suppose there exists a unique this is a

601
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:41,559
symbol for Unique by the way there

602
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,559
exists a unique beta that can be

603
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,480
extended now all we need to do is not

604
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:49,840
hit that

605
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:53,080
beta so all we need I mean think about

606
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:58,520
it seems so easy all we need is Def find

607
00:24:53,080 --> 00:25:03,640
a hash H like a hash key such that Ian

608
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:05,880
of hash key and in Alpha is not equal so

609
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,880
let me call for every Alpha there exists

610
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,320
a single beta let me call it beta bad

611
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,159
like that's a that's the beta we want to

612
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,880
avoid okay so for every Alpha there

613
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,440
exist a

614
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,120
single beta bad of alpha it's a function

615
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,480
of alpha for every Alpha for every

616
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,960
commandment there's a different either

617
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,760
you can answer zero or one so for any

618
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,720
Alpha there exists One Challenge beta

619
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,840
for which the prover can cheat now the

620
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,880
cheating prover wants to hit that bad

621
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:39,720
beta because that's what he can cheat

622
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:42,039
on our job of protecting this is to find

623
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,720
to make sure that every Alpha does not

624
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:45,720
equal to this beta

625
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,520
bad but how hard can it be we just want

626
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,039
to avoid

627
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,559
one you know what let me here let me

628
00:25:53,039 --> 00:26:00,120
give a

629
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:03,240
suggestion IAL hash key or me here h of

630
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:06,919
alpha equals beta

631
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:12,240
bad of alpha +

632
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:12,240
1 it's not better to bad I avoid the bad

633
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,200
one I'm going to use this for my hash

634
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:25,799
function anybody see a problem with this

635
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,720
yeah well it's not really unique

636
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:42,039
because no actually I'm I'm using the

637
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:44,600
computation okay good so what will say

638
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,240
well actually it's not uh unique because

639
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,520
the commitment here has a computational

640
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,640
assumption but actually this commitment

641
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:54,120
will be statistically binding so it's

642
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,039
only the hiding is the zero knowledge is

643
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,760
computational but actually you can open

644
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,600
it suppos there's really like you're

645
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,880
binded okay you can really only open it

646
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,880
in one like you can't open two different

647
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,799
ways many permutations for one that's

648
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,320
fine that's fine but you're right

649
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,159
there's many permutation but suppose you

650
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,960
can open to both then you can give me

651
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,720
both this message and this message if

652
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,559
you give me both this and both this it

653
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,679
means

654
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:29,919
that you have to have this G must have a

655
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,600
cycle

656
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:36,000
because I know that there's a cycle and

657
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,760
guess what it's not in the non-edges to

658
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
the cycle has to be in the

659
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:45,559
edges so so you cannot really cannot you

660
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,640
can open only one okay so again all I

661
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:50,640
want it seems like so easy I have a

662
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,880
proof system for every Alpha the

663
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,519
actually the pro can only cheat on one

664
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,279
single beta all I want to do is avoid

665
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,559
that beta

666
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:02,760
okay I'll give just avoid that do beta

667
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,760
plus

668
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:09,799
one this is delicate anybody see why why

669
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,279
this doesn't

670
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:15,640
work yeah don't you have open commitment

671
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:18,640
to find out which is the bad beta

672
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,679
exactly the problem is Computing beta

673
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,200
bad is really hard how do you know what

674
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:25,880
beta B for example so Computing this is

675
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,919
hard actually if it were easy you

676
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,399
wouldn't need interaction at all it

677
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:34,080
would B and P you have a suing for p you

678
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,880
just give Alpha you you compute this is

679
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,440
the beta and the then you give gamma and

680
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,159
everything's information

681
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,320
theoretic the problem is

682
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,279
Computing the power of this thing is

683
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:47,919
lies in the the power of this

684
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,799
interaction lies on the fact that

685
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,840
Computing what the bad beta is is

686
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:56,960
hard here for example how do you know

687
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,200
which beta you can cheat on well if you

688
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,840
open the Commandment then you see okay

689
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,760
is there you

690
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:06,399
know is there a lot of ones is it only

691
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,399
cycle but you need to open this

692
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:12,919
commitment so Computing this beta is

693
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:15,840
hard without additional

694
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:17,840
information okay so now now what do we

695
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,519
do so we can't give that as a hash

696
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,840
function because this is a hard

697
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:26,519
computation

698
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:29,840
okay so here's the first kind

699
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:32,640
of uh so there are a few aha moments in

700
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,159
this paper the first one is you know

701
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,640
what maybe if this

702
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:40,880
commitment had some trapo maybe you know

703
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,600
there's some trapo information that with

704
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,240
the trapo it becomes

705
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:49,240
easy so let then let's do

706
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:51,519
that let's use trapo in our hash

707
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,519
function okay so now two things I'm

708
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,679
going to do next first show you how you

709
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,559
construct a commitment with a trapo that

710
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,640
will also be useful here so it's going

711
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:01,159
to kind of be a stepping stone so so

712
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:06,080
your specific commitment which is what

713
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:08,360
we use which has a trapo to make beta

714
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,640
easy and then we're going to deal with

715
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,120
uh the next issue that comes up which

716
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,480
kind of the next aha moment appears in

717
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,399
which is well you can't use this trapo

718
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,080
and the clear because if you just that

719
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,760
you can't give the cheating prover theat

720
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,559
you can't give the cheating people like

721
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,720
the trap door actually the problem will

722
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,640
not be the cheating prover the problem

723
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,960
if you give the trap door it's not zero

724
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,279
knowledge anymore so that this trap

725
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,480
don't needs to stay hidden you can't

726
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,919
just use it like put the the reason it's

727
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,320
a commitment it has a purpose it's we

728
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,000
don't put things in the clear for a

729
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,799
reason

730
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,279
so well first see you can make it

731
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:48,720
efficient given the trapo and then we'll

732
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,880
show how this nevertheless even though

733
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,480
we need to keep this trapo secret the

734
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:58,440
fact the mere fact that it exists can be

735
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,919
useful for us to to do the fure meal

736
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,039
okay

737
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,080
questions let me remind you that I

738
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:06,240
really like

739
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,960
questions good bad all of them they're

740
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,000
all fantastic yeah is like the Comm

741
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,559
random screen coming to the second like

742
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
step where you make the Trap like someh

743
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:21,399
vom enough not so the the common random

744
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,760
string will be used in many places the

745
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:24,840
first place it's going to be used is

746
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,120
even to make to make sure my commitment

747
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,600
has a trapo so and then it's going to be

748
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,399
used again and again it's going to vied

749
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:34,519
all over the place so we we'll see that

750
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:35,919
next so any any other questions before

751
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:38,639
we

752
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,559
proceed okay so step one let me just

753
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:43,159
tell you how to construct the commitment

754
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,200
so that it has a trapo and the way I'm

755
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:49,320
going to do it is just using encryption

756
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,679
scheme okay so let me Define the notion

757
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:55,159
of public key encryption and did we

758
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,159
Define public encryption last

759
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,519
time no right okay so okay so let me

760
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:03,720
Define the notion of encryption and

761
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,080
we'll use that as our commitment scheme

762
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,039
okay so what is an

763
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,039
encryption so a public key

764
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:20,360
encryption with uh message space there's

765
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,360
a message space associated with

766
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:29,159
it and these are the messages that we're

767
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,159
going to encrypt it consists

768
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,200
of three

769
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:38,240
algorithms so one is

770
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,720
Gen not to be it has its own key

771
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,919
generation not to be confused with a

772
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,760
hash function that generates hash key

773
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,200
this

774
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:48,679
generates public key and secret key so

775
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,679
this just

776
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:58,760
generates a pair of public key and a

777
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:01,960
secret key let me just mention three

778
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,919
PPT algorithms so we have probabilistic

779
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,679
polinomial time algorithms the first

780
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,200
just generates two keys a public key and

781
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,120
a secret

782
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,720
key the encryption algorithm takes as

783
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:15,480
input a public key and a message from

784
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,240
the message space and it

785
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,200
generates a cipher

786
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,919
text okay from a cipher text space and

787
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:28,000
the third algorithm decrypt so it takes

788
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:30,000
a secret key and a cipher text

789
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and it generates a message in the

790
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,159
message space or or like bot namely I

791
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,639
failed I tried to the cryp but I

792
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:44,480
failed okay and the properties we want

793
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:46,960
the first is correctness or

794
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,519
completeness which just says if you

795
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,799
encrypt a message and then you decrypt

796
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:55,159
it you get your message back okay so it

797
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:58,360
just says for every M for any message if

798
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:00,480
you the probability

799
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,840
that you decrypt so the probability over

800
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:08,360
sample secret key and Public public key

801
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,360
and Secret Key from Key

802
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:20,520
genen and then use the secret key to

803
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,520
decrypt an encryption of

804
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,800
n so it says if you encrypt n you

805
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,560
generate a pair of keys you encrypt the

806
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,679
message M and then you decrypt it you

807
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,040
get back the message with probability

808
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,000
one okay that's just correctness what do

809
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,320
you expect if you take a message you

810
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,159
encrypt it and then you decrypt it you

811
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,919
should get the message

812
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:52,839
back the important property then is

813
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:55,839
security or what's called semantic

814
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:55,839
security

815
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:06,599
and this says that any two messages if

816
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,119
you encrypt one or encrypt the other can

817
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:10,079
distinguish between the two they look

818
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:12,839
the same they're computationally and

819
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:18,920
distinguishable so it just says for

820
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:21,119
every m0 and M1 in the message space so

821
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,920
typically we think by the way the length

822
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:27,000
of M is revealed typically we think of

823
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,200
the message spaces having fixed size for

824
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,359
us throughout

825
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,119
this entire lecture and often is the

826
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:34,720
case we can think of M as just

827
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:36,760
containing two messages the zero message

828
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,400
or the one message and if you want to

829
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,760
encrypt longer message you just encrypt

830
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,880
bit by bit by bit that's a common way to

831
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,520
do encryption not in practice but in

832
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,280
theory in practice it's often not fast

833
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,480
enough but in theory you can just

834
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,040
encrypt each bit separately but in

835
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,520
general for any two message in the

836
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,520
message space if it's just if it's just

837
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:57,319
01 then for the message zero for the

838
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:01,440
message one the claim is that if you

839
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:04,079
generate public key according to gen and

840
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,680
encrypt

841
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,839
m0 this is indistinguishable

842
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:11,800
computationally IND distinguishable from

843
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:14,040
generating a public key according to gen

844
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,040
and

845
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,480
encrypting message

846
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,880
one so for any messages you know the

847
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,240
messages I'm I'm telling you I'm

848
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,560
encrypting m z or

849
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,800
M1 you can't tell the difference I'm

850
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,160
giving you don't know I'm giving you one

851
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,880
of them you have no idea if them zero

852
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,040
encrypted or them one encrypted okay not

853
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,200
there's no Randomness over the messages

854
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,359
for any two mess fixed messages you

855
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,920
don't know if I encrypt yeah so even you

856
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,359
don't know if I encrypt and if I give

857
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:45,040
you two encryptions of zero I give you

858
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,040
encryption of 01 can't tell the

859
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,079
difference okay so that that's the

860
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:53,160
definition and we have these public key

861
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:55,520
encryption schemes under a whole slew of

862
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,599
of uh of assumptions ltis based

863
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,440
assumption not lce based like a discreet

864
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,000
log that we saw earlier in the semester

865
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,119
uh and so on but I don't want to talk

866
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,839
about instantiation because this is more

867
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,040
kind of class on proof systems and I

868
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,760
don't want to make it too hardcore uh

869
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,720
crypto so let me just use this nacho how

870
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:17,720
to actually construct this but we have

871
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,119
many instantiation constructions but

872
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,720
suppose we have this let me show you how

873
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:24,599
what what the commitment would be so now

874
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,760
what I want the commitment to be instead

875
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:29,160
of commitment make this an encryption

876
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,160
let me actually put

877
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,160
another

878
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:43,920
color so make this be an

879
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:47,520
encryption with some public key of

880
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,599
Pi so what I'm telling the prover now

881
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,280
I'm telling him look I want to be able

882
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,520
in the analysis at least to open up

883
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,079
there and see kind

884
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,920
of what where the ones are and where the

885
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:01,280
zero so that later I'll be able to

886
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,680
understand where the non-edges are and

887
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,520
so what's the bad

888
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:10,440
beta so now I uh I want to tell the

889
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,880
prover so please don't the commitment I

890
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,640
want you to send me is the encryption

891
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,319
now a Tiding it's still hiding yeah

892
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,920
nobody uh so nobody so the it's still

893
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:22,160
zero knowledge still satisfied kind of

894
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,480
it's locked it's like the verifier can't

895
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,680
doesn't has no idea what's in

896
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:31,280
there and supposedly it and it's so

897
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,160
binding because uh because you know once

898
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,000
you encrypt you're stuck it's like it's

899
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,400
it's uh uh the message you're the

900
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,800
message is sitting there because then

901
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,920
you can use a secret key to decrypt it

902
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,400
so it really has the hiding and binding

903
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,880
property great it's like a real

904
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,880
commandment

905
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,839
scheme

906
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,560
yeah

907
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,560
yeah does publishing encryption imply

908
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,000
that there's no possibility of a second

909
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,000
secret key that to something

910
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,520
else okay great question great question

911
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,280
so the the great so you're asking wait

912
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:13,000
what of the public key has many secret

913
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,680
Keys associated with it and one of them

914
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,040
decrypts to M and the other one decrypts

915
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,560
to M Prime let's say so no here I Say No

916
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,640
by my definition no because my

917
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,960
correctness

918
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,240
says that if you choose public key in

919
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,880
secret key pair with ability one you

920
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:34,040
will always get your message back so

921
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:36,839
there's no secret key that will give you

922
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,160
a different message that's my definition

923
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:42,520
so you're what you're proposing is not

924
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:45,760
for me it's not uh doesn't satisfy my my

925
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,560
definition so now use a public use a

926
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,960
public encryption that satisfies my

927
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:53,359
definition so now we kind of now you're

928
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,680
binded good great question the these are

929
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,280
really really great questions

930
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,680
yeah here in the expression you're

931
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,760
chosing publicy and secret keq all come

932
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,359
from the same G function yeah what if

933
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,520
like another like it doesn't gu anything

934
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,240
about like a different okay very very

935
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,119
good question very good question so what

936
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,560
what uh so the point was the

937
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,599
following look we have all these

938
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,520
guarantees the correctness and the

939
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,480
security assuming the public key is

940
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,000
generated according to

941
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,839
gen now my question here who generates

942
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,119
this public key

943
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:32,800
how do I know it's generate according to

944
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:34,640
Jen if we let the approver generates

945
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,240
generate the public

946
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:41,440
key he may may then maybe it's a bad

947
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:45,040
public key that is never going to appear

948
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,160
here and for that bad public key maybe

949
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,880
your concern is valid maybe you can open

950
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:52,160
it in different

951
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,960
ways and you're completely right that is

952
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,280
a problem actually even in our it's it's

953
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,119
not a hypothetical problems a hypoth

954
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,599
medal problem our scheme that we use

955
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,520
that we want to get we want to get this

956
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:05,079
andus assumption that specific scheme we

957
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:08,240
use has that property has that problem

958
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,920
that if the key is generated badly

959
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,280
actually there's no binding I can cheat

960
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,839
I can open two different ways I will

961
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,520
never be able to do that if I generate

962
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,560
according to Jen but if I generate it

963
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,079
maliciously I can choose a very bad

964
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,400
public key nobody will be able to tell

965
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,040
the difference it will look like a good

966
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,160
publicy but it's actually generated

967
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,280
completely

968
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,480
differently and it would have never

969
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,200
appeared in J and with that public key

970
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,520
there's no no uh correctness and I can

971
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,319
cheat and I can do whatever I

972
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,720
want so very good you you you found the

973
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:44,040
the problem in this

974
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,040
approach so what do we do how do we fix

975
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,839
it so this comes to your question in the

976
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,480
beginning well you know what let's

977
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:54,319
assume that there's a trusted party that

978
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,640
generates this publicy for us so let's

979
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:59,040
assume for now that there's kind of a

980
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,880
common reference string we all agree

981
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,920
there's like a public key sitting here

982
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,880
that's in the kind of what's called a a

983
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,599
common reference string or common random

984
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,640
string everybody knows it both the

985
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,079
approver and the verifier we all agree

986
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,440
on this public key and we assume that it

987
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:16,599
was trusted like generated according to

988
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,000
Jen nobody has the secret key okay

989
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:21,200
nobody has the secret key we'll never

990
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,359
need to open the secret key so in this

991
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,880
protocol what we do what do I do I'm

992
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,000
approver I encrypt bit by bit so how do

993
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,559
I encrypt I use random so I didn't say

994
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,119
but this encryption is a randomized

995
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:34,559
protocol so I choose Randomness I

996
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,839
encrypt the bid I choose Randomness I

997
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:37,680
encrypt the next bit I choose Randomness

998
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,200
I encrypt the next and so on so forth

999
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,240
and when I'm asked to open I reveal my

1000
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,640
Randomness I so look how I encrypt it

1001
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:47,640
see there's Randomness I took the

1002
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,319
encryption with public key and my bid 01

1003
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,000
with this Randomness and see that's

1004
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:54,680
what's written here so I I can just open

1005
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,200
by by without using secret key Nobody

1006
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,800
Knows the secret key the secret key is

1007
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,119
gone someone just came with the public

1008
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,319
key and I use the I I open here not with

1009
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:06,960
a secret key but I I I show you the

1010
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:12,480
randomness that I Ed to encrypt and that

1011
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,480
kind of uh you know uh is an opening for

1012
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,599
me yeah does that mean your CRS be like

1013
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,319
a fully like uniformly randoming because

1014
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:25,920
if you were to read out the public also

1015
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:27,200
like secretly so okay so the question

1016
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,040
was great great question the the

1017
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,040
question was does that mean that the CRS

1018
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,400
here cannot be truly random because it's

1019
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,319
not truly random it's a public key a

1020
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,119
public key may not be truly

1021
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:41,760
random and the answer is well first of

1022
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,520
all some publicy have happen to be to

1023
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,839
truly random the public key for this

1024
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,599
schem scheme is not truly random however

1025
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,599
it's

1026
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,800
indistinguishable from being truly

1027
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:55,400
random now so the scheme we actually use

1028
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,720
the public has the property it's not

1029
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:00,520
random it's like a lw2 for those who

1030
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:04,599
know what learning with a is but it's

1031
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:07,040
not it's that's not truly random however

1032
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:10,240
it is indistinguishable from

1033
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,720
random now if you have soundness with

1034
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,440
public key that indistinguishable from

1035
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:14,599
random soundness should hold even if

1036
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,040
it's completely

1037
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,720
random so actually you can make this

1038
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,440
completely random and actually in the

1039
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,119
paper they actually take advantage of

1040
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,680
that because if the public key is

1041
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,559
completely random then you get

1042
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,599
statistical zero knowledge computational

1043
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:33,359
sound is whereas if it's you can play

1044
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,880
around with in this protocol especially

1045
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,920
when you go to the N to the non-active

1046
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,480
version there's a tension you can either

1047
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,000
get statistical soundness and

1048
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,079
computational zero knowledge or or

1049
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,079
statistical zero knowledge and

1050
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,760
computational soundness and you can play

1051
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,240
with this public key whether to make it

1052
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,680
kind of the true public key in which

1053
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,599
case you get statistical soundness and

1054
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,520
computational zero knowledge or if you

1055
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,640
want to take like a fake public key

1056
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,960
which is the all zero and then you get

1057
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:02,440
comput ational soundness and statistical

1058
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,559
zerom so you can kind of play um with

1059
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,559
these uh with these

1060
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:13,240
things okay so this is the the protocol

1061
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:15,160
for which we'll show the fing holds okay

1062
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:18,280
so again the commitment is just replaced

1063
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:20,319
with a public

1064
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,839
encryption

1065
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:26,280
yeah Comm reference I mean the public by

1066
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:30,000
for example change the the way of

1067
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:32,319
opening for example we also uh also

1068
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,839
require approver to provide the random

1069
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:34,839
for for

1070
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,000
J oh that's a good okay I didn't okay

1071
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,960
good so what you're saying good good

1072
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,079
suggestion what you're saying is you're

1073
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:50,599
saying wait how about he gives us public

1074
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:53,079
key it can be malicious but when he

1075
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:55,160
opens we'll ask him okay so I'll tell

1076
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:58,119
you the problem with that if when he

1077
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:59,440
opens he gives the randomness he used so

1078
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:00,839
you're sit why don't he give the

1079
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,160
randomness he used to generate this

1080
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:05,079
public key and now you know that it's a

1081
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:07,960
valid public key you'll that will indeed

1082
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:10,559
ensure soundness however that will break

1083
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,920
the zero knowledge because once you give

1084
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,160
the randomness you also give the secret

1085
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,000
key away because this Randomness was

1086
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,800
used to generate both of them and if the

1087
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,040
secret key then you lost the the zero

1088
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,520
knowledge but great suggestion okay

1089
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,880
great you guys it's clear that you're

1090
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,880
thinking which is fantastic great

1091
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,880
suggestions

1092
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:33,160
any any other questions before

1093
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:37,800
we we move

1094
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:40,960
on okay so okay so we're making progress

1095
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,960
now what do we know so let me uh hide

1096
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,960
this encryption for a

1097
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:51,160
second let's go back here now okay now I

1098
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:52,559
want you actually to for forget that

1099
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,559
this was an encryption because we'll use

1100
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,240
another encryption okay and I don't want

1101
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:58,079
you to be confused with this encryption

1102
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,880
the other encryption what I want you to

1103
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,240
remember about the commitment that

1104
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,680
there's some trap door like a secret key

1105
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,760
I'll call it trap door on purpose

1106
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:09,319
because we'll have another encryption

1107
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,920
which will have a secret key so I want

1108
00:47:09,319 --> 00:47:14,280
what I want you to remember about this

1109
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,200
commitment is that there's some trapo

1110
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:19,720
information that with that trapo

1111
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:22,040
information you can open and know which

1112
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:25,359
B is

1113
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:28,839
bad okay so a trapdoor has a a

1114
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,839
commitment has some trapdoor information

1115
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,040
okay which allows you kind of to open it

1116
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,559
in that case open the encryption and

1117
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,319
then you know where the ones are and

1118
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:39,359
that will help you

1119
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:42,960
decide

1120
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:45,920
uh a where where the bad be

1121
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:49,000
lies actually know I think I I need to

1122
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:52,760
also add a commitment to pie

1123
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,760
there because otherwise

1124
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,680
I'm how do you know which maybe you can

1125
00:47:56,359 --> 00:47:59,680
tell anyone way if you add a commitment

1126
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:02,720
to Pi it's easier

1127
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:04,920
but if you don't add a commitment to Pi

1128
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,559
is it clear that just by seeing ones

1129
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,559
it's easy to

1130
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,559
test

1131
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,760
uh

1132
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,200
a yeah I guess I guess if you open both

1133
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:24,520
you can see both yeah I don't think you

1134
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,319
need it okay uh but anyway so so so good

1135
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,160
sorry uh so so now what I want to I want

1136
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:33,800
to do I want to say here's my hash

1137
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:36,200
function it has trapo hardwire to it

1138
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,599
once he knows the trap door it's a trap

1139
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,440
door depends on the public key on the

1140
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,559
kind of the CRS it doesn't depend on the

1141
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:45,160
actual once he has the trap door he'll

1142
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:49,040
know what the bad thing is and

1143
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,319
done okay it would be it's one can say

1144
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,680
Okay use

1145
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:56,200
this as the fure Mir hash

1146
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,000
function it's efficient it's good

1147
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,200
however as we said the problem is then

1148
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,240
you know the trap door it's sitting

1149
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,680
there you know you know the trap door

1150
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,160
and once you the trap door it's not zero

1151
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,880
knowledge so that's the

1152
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,079
problem and then there were attempts to

1153
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,839
try to

1154
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:16,799
do okay let's obfuscate these things and

1155
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:19,000
a lot of kind of hammers were thrown in

1156
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:21,359
this direction and it resulted in crazy

1157
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,839
assumptions and anyway there was a long

1158
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:24,240
kind of line of work well that's what we

1159
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:30,160
tried to

1160
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:31,760
do okay but then then here is their idea

1161
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,440
so now I'm can tell you the next aha

1162
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,520
moment so again one option is to throw

1163
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,400
kind of what's called obfuscation at

1164
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,960
this for those who don't know

1165
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,680
obfuscation don't worry about it

1166
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,040
essentially garbling so that the trap

1167
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,400
door will be really hidden there nobody

1168
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,440
would be able to find it and even that

1169
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:49,319
it was like a messy approach that we

1170
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,240
tried and we got really really strong

1171
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:53,040
assumptions which I have no idea if

1172
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,000
they're true or not it was kind of a

1173
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,160
messy approach that a bunch of us bunch

1174
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,240
of papers kind of followed that approach

1175
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:05,240
very complicated and you know okay then

1176
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:08,400
came this paper and here is the the

1177
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,920
here's the beautiful idea okay so the

1178
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,680
beautiful idea was the following they

1179
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,359
said you know what yeah you can't give

1180
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,480
trapo that's a problem give an

1181
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,760
encryption of trapo forget about this

1182
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,960
encryption right that's a different

1183
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,559
encryption so now fresh new

1184
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,400
encryption why don't you give encryption

1185
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:28,240
let me denote the encryption of trapo

1186
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,640
here by hat that's off a common way we

1187
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,040
use fully homomorphic encryption which

1188
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:37,599
I'm going to Define next so they said

1189
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:39,880
put in this in the in the function an

1190
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,400
encryption of the trap door that helps

1191
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,400
you open the

1192
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,280
commitment I like so okay and then what

1193
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,400
what do we can do with the cyppher text

1194
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,280
we can't do anything with it cyppher

1195
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,799
text is like junk what do we can do with

1196
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:56,720
that so the idea the idea was you know

1197
00:50:52,799 --> 00:51:00,359
what don't just use any encryption use

1198
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:02,480
what's called a fully homomorphic

1199
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:05,160
encryption what is a fully homomorphic

1200
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,760
encryption I'll explain that next but

1201
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:12,599
essentially what it does it allows you

1202
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:15,720
to compute unencrypted data okay so a a

1203
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:16,480
fly homomorphic encryption is exactly

1204
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,760
the

1205
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:24,000
same as a uh encryption scheme so a fom

1206
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,000
morphic it's a public key

1207
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,960
encryption so let me write a fully

1208
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:40,880
homomorphic public encryption scheme is

1209
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,559
encryption scheme gen encrypt and

1210
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,240
decrypt but it also allows you to do

1211
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:50,400
computation and encrypted data so what

1212
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,400
do I mean there's an eval

1213
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,960
function it takes a bunch of Cipher

1214
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:59,000
texts and it can do computation on the B

1215
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,839
hiding underneath the cyppher

1216
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:07,200
Tex so it takes a public

1217
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:09,119
key a description of a circuit C think

1218
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,920
of it with additions and multiplication

1219
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,319
M

1220
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:16,079
two and it gets a cipher text so

1221
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:19,359
encryption of one of B1 bit one let me

1222
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:22,319
think of it now as I said think of it as

1223
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:25,240
the message space being zero and one so

1224
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:27,720
it gets encryption of bits let's say

1225
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:31,280
encryption or I'll just call it Cipher

1226
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:35,160
text Cipher text one up to Cipher text

1227
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:38,000
n each one encrypting a single bit the

1228
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,240
circuit takes as input n Bits and

1229
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,440
produces a

1230
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:44,920
bit and it outputs some Cipher

1231
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:47,720
text and this Cipher

1232
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,520
text if here you have encryption of B1

1233
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:52,559
B2 up to

1234
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:57,359
BN this Cipher text should have

1235
00:52:52,559 --> 00:53:01,319
encryption of C of B1 up to BN

1236
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:04,520
okay so what this eval does it gets

1237
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:06,000
encryption of bits and it can kind of

1238
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,480
compute an encryption of the addition of

1239
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,799
the bits encryption of the

1240
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:12,720
multiplication of the bits and so on so

1241
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:16,319
forth it can do arbitrary computation it

1242
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:20,319
can compute an arbitrary circuit c c

1243
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:24,359
goes from 01 to the N to

1244
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:28,079
01 it can be arbitary computation under

1245
00:53:24,359 --> 00:53:30,480
the the so let me I'll just write

1246
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,440
maybe I'll write here the completeness

1247
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,680
property for the eval so I wrote the

1248
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:37,319
completeness property where all you do

1249
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,799
is decrypt if you encrypt and decrypt

1250
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:42,040
you get back the message the Evan also

1251
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:43,920
has a completeness property which

1252
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,400
essentially says so let me just write it

1253
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,599
down so completeness of eval I'll write

1254
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,599
it

1255
00:53:53,799 --> 00:53:59,520
here it says that for every

1256
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,040
B1 up to

1257
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:05,240
BN

1258
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,240
and uh the

1259
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,319
probability that when you decrypt Evan

1260
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:11,319
oh sorry for every

1261
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:24,880
C for every circuit C when you decrypt

1262
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,880
so choose a public key secret key pair

1263
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:36,319
when you decrypt use the secret key to

1264
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:39,119
decrypt the eval function so now

1265
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:43,520
evaluate with respect to the public key

1266
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:47,440
and that's the circuit C evaluate on the

1267
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:49,480
on the N Cipher text corresponding to B1

1268
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,280
up to BN so

1269
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:56,440
encryption public key with

1270
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:58,359
B1 up to encryption of public key on bid

1271
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:02,200
b

1272
00:54:58,359 --> 00:55:04,799
n so encrypt each of these bits you'll

1273
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:07,000
get encryption of B1 up to encryption BN

1274
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:09,280
then evaluate do homomorphic

1275
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,160
computations on these encryption bits

1276
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,160
with respect to Circuit

1277
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:18,680
C now you get a cipher text you should

1278
00:55:15,319 --> 00:55:21,440
get a cipher text that encrypts c of B1

1279
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:25,280
of to BN and indeed the probability that

1280
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,799
when you decrypt you get C of B1 up to

1281
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,960
BN

1282
00:55:27,799 --> 00:55:30,960
is one or close to

1283
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:43,280
one okay so again what eval does it does

1284
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:46,799
a computation on this encrypted data it

1285
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:49,280
computes an arbitrary circuit

1286
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:51,160
C that that when you decrypt it and did

1287
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,440
you get C with probability very very

1288
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:56,359
close to one I wrote here one minus

1289
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,880
negligible as opposed to one is be

1290
00:55:56,359 --> 00:56:02,640
because our scheme have this negative

1291
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,640
probability of err so that's why

1292
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,920
I okay so again high level what the FHA

1293
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,559
allows you to do fully homop encryption

1294
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,079
allows you to do is to do this

1295
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:17,599
computation and encrypted

1296
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:21,480
data so now the idea is okay so okay

1297
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,480
questions about the fully homomorphic

1298
00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:30,839
encryption we're good yeah

1299
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,880
matter what C is like oh never mind mind

1300
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:34,839
like I was thinking just like uh

1301
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,440
arithmetic or good good no that's

1302
00:56:34,839 --> 00:56:38,640
actually a very good question uh it's a

1303
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:41,160
very good question so the question was

1304
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,280
this circuit C what is it so the circuit

1305
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:45,359
C think of it as a circuit that has

1306
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:49,920
addition and multiplication Gates mod

1307
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:51,480
too okay so any polinomial size uh

1308
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,520
circuit that has addition and

1309
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:58,240
multiplication Gates mod to great thank

1310
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:58,240
you other questions

1311
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,520
okay so now let's go back so now we have

1312
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:06,039
an encryption scheme that we can do

1313
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:08,720
computation and encrypted data now let's

1314
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:11,720
go back remember where are we we're

1315
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,119
saying all we want is to avoid this bad

1316
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:16,079
we want to Hash function it's only

1317
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:18,000
purpose to avoid one single point how

1318
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,680
hard can that

1319
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,520
be the thing I'll tell the hard problem

1320
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,119
is it needs to avoid the bad point for

1321
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,839
each and every Alpha that's kind of the

1322
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:28,760
hard part that for every Alpha avoid the

1323
00:57:26,839 --> 00:57:30,319
bad one if you just wanted to avoid the

1324
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,319
bad one for one alpha choose random

1325
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,559
probably probably you're not going to

1326
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:35,960
hit the bad one but you need to

1327
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:40,280
avoid the bad one for each and every

1328
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:43,319
Alpha that's kind of harder okay so now

1329
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:44,839
but if we have the trapo then it's easy

1330
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:46,880
but we said look we can't give the trapo

1331
00:57:44,839 --> 00:57:48,880
that will break zero

1332
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,240
knowledge so instead we say you know

1333
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:54,520
what let's give a homomorphic encryption

1334
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,520
of the

1335
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,640
trapo now now this seems like not

1336
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,160
helpful why is it not helpful okay let's

1337
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:05,400
say you can encrypt on you can compute

1338
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:08,160
on encrypted data so okay do the

1339
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,920
computation of computing bad so suppose

1340
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:13,039
you have so now here's my hatch function

1341
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:16,039
it has trapdoor hard wire it so think of

1342
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:18,440
it like h of instead of trapo they'll

1343
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:20,839
have hat of trapo why

1344
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:24,119
not and it will do this computation

1345
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:25,880
under the hood like with eval you know

1346
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:29,000
under the hood of the encryption very

1347
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:31,240
nice so now on input Alpha you will get

1348
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,240
the

1349
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:40,039
bad bad Alpha uh plus one very nice but

1350
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:44,039
encrypted so why is that

1351
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:47,240
helpful yeah I I guess solution but you

1352
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:50,880
can also encrypt the eval encryption the

1353
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:52,319
protect two different meth are not equal

1354
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,280
again what are you saying encrypt

1355
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:58,039
encrypt EV H the left hand side of the

1356
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,039
equality

1357
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:03,119
you can encrypt exactly that's kind of

1358
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:03,119
what

1359
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:08,079
so that's kind of what I'm doing I'm

1360
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:10,400
saying this is the this is okay this

1361
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,400
okay this is a shorthand for this is

1362
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:15,359
actually

1363
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:18,319
eval of this is kind of the hash key the

1364
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:22,000
hash key will have kind of trapdoor in

1365
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:24,319
it and an input Alpha it should output

1366
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:27,640
this and what we're doing we're saying

1367
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:29,640
okay and crypto or you can think of it

1368
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,559
the Hash k being trapo and encrypt the

1369
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,559
entire

1370
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,200
thing you can do everything under the

1371
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,920
hood of the encryption the problem is

1372
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:38,680
you'll get it you want the output to be

1373
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,240
different than beta you don't want the

1374
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:43,240
you got a cipher

1375
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:46,880
text I want I I want this to be

1376
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:48,520
different than beta that's what I want I

1377
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,559
don't want like underneath the hood to

1378
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:54,400
be something that's different than

1379
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:57,799
beta so this seems like a bad idea like

1380
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:59,760
it gets us nowhere

1381
00:59:57,799 --> 01:00:00,839
yes again where are we we said if we

1382
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,240
knew

1383
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:04,720
trapdoor we would be done the hash

1384
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,799
function the EV Val the hash function

1385
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:09,160
we'll take this trapo compute beta and

1386
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:10,640
output not beta you know move it by one

1387
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:12,400
move one of the bits by one whatever as

1388
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:15,000
long as it doesn't not the

1389
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:17,319
beta and now they say you know what

1390
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,720
let's do everything under the hood what

1391
01:00:17,319 --> 01:00:22,480
then we'll get an encryption why would

1392
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:24,680
that not be bit like it seems like

1393
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,480
you're not getting anywhere to me it

1394
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:27,920
seemed it seemed like when they first

1395
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,760
presented this idea I'm like okay this

1396
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,280
seems completely useless so what now

1397
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:35,280
everything is under the hood and guess

1398
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,280
what we're almost done

1399
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:42,680
yeah you take the

1400
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,240
randomness so you know what I want to

1401
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,160
say something even before that there's

1402
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:00,119
even a mismatch

1403
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,799
uh beta let's say consists of Lambda

1404
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:04,400
bits for example in our case because we

1405
01:01:01,799 --> 01:01:06,920
repeated it it's Lambda bits this is not

1406
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,599
even Lambda bits it's much more than

1407
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:11,400
Lambda bits because we inced by bit it's

1408
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:14,559
much bigger it it doesn't

1409
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:17,200
even it's like seems like completely B

1410
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:19,960
this is going to be the length of beta

1411
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:22,599
time security parameter so it's

1412
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:27,440
not it doesn't even correspond

1413
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:31,160
to like the sizes don't even match

1414
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:33,880
so it seems like an encryption is not

1415
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:39,160
helpful

1416
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:41,119
yeah beta bad given Alpha in oh good he

1417
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:43,039
the only way he can compute beta bad is

1418
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,839
if he has the oh how can you compute giv

1419
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:48,559
the trap door you're saying

1420
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:51,319
okay what yeah so what he will do the

1421
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:53,039
trap door in this protocol allows you to

1422
01:01:51,319 --> 01:01:56,119
kind of open the

1423
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:58,279
commitment okay so now you see each and

1424
01:01:56,119 --> 01:02:01,079
each point if it has a zero one Z One Z

1425
01:01:58,279 --> 01:02:03,279
one so now why why do you know what's

1426
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:07,559
bet bad because now you

1427
01:02:03,279 --> 01:02:09,960
look if it has just a hamiltonian

1428
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:12,119
cycle I mean the truth is it's easier to

1429
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,799
see it if you have the the com the pie

1430
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:15,319
suppose you always also committed to Pi

1431
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:16,920
why it's just easier to see it that way

1432
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:21,200
suppose I tell you don't only commit to

1433
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:23,960
that commit also to your Pi now you see

1434
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:29,880
what's in there either if you remove Pi

1435
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:33,319
you see what if you so you see if

1436
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:37,599
uh so you look at all the edges of Pi of

1437
01:02:33,319 --> 01:02:39,400
G and you make sure that these edges are

1438
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,160
zero everywhere there's zero if one of

1439
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:44,640
them is one you know that he won't

1440
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:46,599
succeed in open in then then this is not

1441
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:49,799
bad then the Beals one is not bad

1442
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:52,440
because uh here or he will fail the bad

1443
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:54,319
is where he will succeed a bad be the be

1444
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:57,000
that like a bad beta the beta that will

1445
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:59,839
allow him to succeed so now if you can

1446
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,319
open everything now you can see if

1447
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:06,440
there's one Edge Of Pi of G if there's a

1448
01:03:03,319 --> 01:03:08,480
non Edge that has a one then you know

1449
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,520
okay this is definitely not bad he can

1450
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,440
and and so he won't be able to see so

1451
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:17,000
this is the bit of bad on the other hand

1452
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,760
if all the non-edges are indeed zero you

1453
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,160
know there's he can't open hamiltonian

1454
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:23,480
cycle because there is no hamiltonian

1455
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:25,200
cycle so then this becomes the so then

1456
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,680
this becomes the bad so if you know

1457
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,839
what's in the commitment you can tell

1458
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,960
which one is the bad so the trap door

1459
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:33,240
allows you to compute the bad

1460
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:35,039
efficiently that's the point yeah so

1461
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:36,640
does that me the tra the random coins

1462
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:39,520
used in each

1463
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:42,000
C the random coins used like the

1464
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:44,960
randomness that's used inside each like

1465
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:48,559
is that what the trap door is

1466
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,960
um no I I I want I'm thinking of the

1467
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,359
trap door as being the secret key

1468
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:53,520
corresponding to the public key so you

1469
01:03:52,359 --> 01:03:56,039
you I'll tell you the problem the

1470
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:58,119
problem of using the randomness then

1471
01:03:56,039 --> 01:03:59,480
it's chosen by the cheating prover and I

1472
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:01,480
don't know what it I don't know how he's

1473
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:04,279
going to use it I don't want to the

1474
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:08,400
trapo you write the the trapo okay let

1475
01:04:04,279 --> 01:04:10,000
me this is an important point so note I

1476
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,160
can open this

1477
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,520
commitment by use giving you the

1478
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,640
randomness that I used to generate this

1479
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,279
commitment that would be that would be a

1480
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:19,640
good

1481
01:04:16,279 --> 01:04:21,520
trapo but when I designed the fash

1482
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:22,799
function I have no idea what the cheat

1483
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,720
what Randomness the cheating Prov is

1484
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,880
going to use maybe it's even

1485
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:27,440
deterministic I don't know what he's

1486
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:30,079
doing he may just give me a a bun I

1487
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,079
don't know so I I I don't know ahead of

1488
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:33,760
time it's random coins and different

1489
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,079
cheating Pro will have different random

1490
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,720
coins so I want to put something in the

1491
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:40,200
CRS you know the hash function the

1492
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:42,240
Fatman hash function so this track door

1493
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,799
is actually going to be the secret key

1494
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:46,160
correspond to the public

1495
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:48,039
key the secret key is not going to be

1496
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,599
used in here it's never going to be used

1497
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:52,760
in the protocol but it will be used in

1498
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:52,760
the

1499
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,640
analysis okay great yes

1500
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:04,799
to uh interactive Pro where you com to

1501
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:06,079
the witness or can to where the first

1502
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:08,839
message

1503
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:11,440
is again you're saying is this is only

1504
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:15,720
limited to Pro System where you commit

1505
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:18,680
to the weakness or can youe to Pro

1506
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:23,440
somewhere you the

1507
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:26,520
firstage so okay so this this technique

1508
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:28,440
works okay so this technique works for

1509
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,640
this protocol where you commit to

1510
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,839
Something in

1511
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:34,839
open and after I'll show you why I'll

1512
01:05:32,839 --> 01:05:37,520
show you that it's actually more General

1513
01:05:34,839 --> 01:05:39,279
and it applies to a large actually slew

1514
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:42,000
of protocols where there's no commitment

1515
01:05:39,279 --> 01:05:44,000
whatsoever for example it applies to gkr

1516
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,400
protocol where it's just Su Che it

1517
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,880
applies to the Su Che

1518
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:51,760
protocol and so it's not specific to

1519
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:53,799
this and I'll show you later all you

1520
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,640
need is kind of this trapo that tells

1521
01:05:53,799 --> 01:05:57,720
you where the bad kind of challeng

1522
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,760
challenges are and once you have a trap

1523
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,799
door that tells you where the bad

1524
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:04,559
challenges are then you're you kind of

1525
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:05,920
can use it but we'll we'll we'll mention

1526
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:07,760
that at the end of class like towards

1527
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,039
the end but yeah it's we'll see that

1528
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,440
it's General so in some sense you don't

1529
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:14,960
even need to look too too detail to that

1530
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:17,400
protocol it's the idea here is more high

1531
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:20,920
level we say look in any interactive

1532
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:23,720
proof there's the beta that are bad that

1533
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:26,079
like bad for security that are good for

1534
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:28,480
the adversary but they're bad for

1535
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:32,480
if the adversary managed to hit a bad

1536
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:34,760
beta an alpha for which h of alpha gives

1537
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:37,319
him a bad beta then he can cheat me I

1538
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:38,480
want to avoid these bad bad betas and

1539
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:40,559
now we're saying suppose there's only

1540
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:43,480
one bad beta for Simplicity this one has

1541
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:45,359
one bad beta so we're good if it has one

1542
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:49,160
bad beta oh I want to avoid that

1543
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:52,520
one now if there's some trap door that

1544
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:56,200
allows me to compute that bad

1545
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:57,559
beta then I can't put the Trap in the

1546
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,760
kind of the hash function and give it to

1547
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:02,200
the world there's a reason why it's a

1548
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:04,799
trap door and not public uh here in this

1549
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:08,279
case it's for zero knowledge but what I

1550
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:10,559
can do is give an encryption of the

1551
01:07:08,279 --> 01:07:12,200
trapo and actually in the actual scheme

1552
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:13,680
it won't be encryption of the trap door

1553
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:16,240
encryption of zero nobody's G to ever

1554
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:19,400
decrypt this thing but let's think of it

1555
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:22,599
as an encryption of the trapo for

1556
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:26,760
now now again where are we why did we

1557
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:26,760
make any progress here

1558
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:37,200
okay so next is the most amazing point I

1559
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:39,559
think when I saw this it took me a very

1560
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:42,319
long time to process because it's such

1561
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:42,319
an ingenious

1562
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:48,920
idea but here's the idea okay so they

1563
01:07:46,359 --> 01:07:53,119
say yeah you know what I'm going to take

1564
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:55,279
the I'm nevertheless my hash function is

1565
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:57,799
going so so they so oh Sor so then they

1566
01:07:55,279 --> 01:08:01,240
say okay you you're right this kind of

1567
01:07:57,799 --> 01:08:03,240
hash function that has the a the trap

1568
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:05,279
door in it and you evaluate the trap

1569
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:07,480
door that's you're right it's not good

1570
01:08:05,279 --> 01:08:08,839
it doesn't even type check the output is

1571
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:12,279
not the me the length it's supposed to

1572
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:14,319
be yeah this is nonsense let us fix this

1573
01:08:12,279 --> 01:08:16,440
and here's how they fix it let me put

1574
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:19,600
the Val here so because it' be nice to

1575
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:21,719
see so here's the their fix they said

1576
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:24,440
you know what fine that may have been

1577
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:29,159
the wrong function we're gonna encrypt

1578
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:31,319
so our RCR hash key is going to consist

1579
01:08:29,159 --> 01:08:34,040
of encryption of another function

1580
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:36,880
g i I'm using by the way I'm using the

1581
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:38,159
hat to denote fully homomorphic

1582
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,080
encryption as opposed to standard

1583
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:42,040
encryption okay that's often we use in

1584
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,600
the literature the hat is kind of a

1585
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:47,239
shortcut to denote public key comma

1586
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:49,600
encryption of of G and when you use this

1587
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:52,120
hat we usually use it when we want to

1588
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:55,199
talk about fully homomorphic encryption

1589
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:57,679
okay okay so now they say okay this is

1590
01:08:55,199 --> 01:09:00,159
going to going to be my nevertheless I'm

1591
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:04,359
going to encrypt a g what's the G we'll

1592
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:08,040
see I'm going to encrypt a g and my so

1593
01:09:04,359 --> 01:09:11,319
so my uh the so here's their hash key

1594
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:13,679
what the here the hash key is gonna

1595
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:16,319
be I'm going to generate a public key

1596
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:18,679
and encrypt a function G okay so it's

1597
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:20,759
like the public key corresponding to G

1598
01:09:18,679 --> 01:09:24,359
and then G which is just another

1599
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:26,640
shortcut to say encryption of G and when

1600
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:29,600
I say I encrypted G just think about

1601
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,920
encrypt the description of the circuit

1602
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:33,359
okay so there's some way to describe the

1603
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,440
circuit I encrypt the

1604
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,799
description okay so I encrypt this

1605
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:40,719
description of a circuit G what this

1606
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:44,040
what this G is we'll see okay but that's

1607
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:47,120
my hash key so this is the hash key how

1608
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:50,839
do you what how do you

1609
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:53,440
evaluate hash key and

1610
01:09:50,839 --> 01:09:57,320
Alpha they say you know what just

1611
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:58,719
compute G of alpha under the hood how do

1612
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:02,600
we compute G of alpha under the hood

1613
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:05,199
essentially they say do the eval of the

1614
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:07,280
FH there's two eval it's a bit conf

1615
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:09,640
confusing because we usually don't know

1616
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:11,480
the evaluation Computing the hash

1617
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,960
function by eval but now we also have

1618
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:16,560
the eval of the fol morphic encryption

1619
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:19,840
scheme so take the fol morphic

1620
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,920
encryption scheme take the cipher text G

1621
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,199
so take the public key corresponding to

1622
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,440
the cipher

1623
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:27,400
Tex what's the function what's the

1624
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:30,880
circuit C it's going to be kind of a

1625
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:32,960
universal circuit sub

1626
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,520
Alpha I'll tell you what this is in a

1627
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:38,520
second and the certex is

1628
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:41,679
G and this universal circuit sub Alpha

1629
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:44,480
all it does the definition it takes as

1630
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:45,880
input a circuit g and an out outputs G

1631
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:48,480
of

1632
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:50,040
alpha so essentially what we do what

1633
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,000
this hatch function does is exactly what

1634
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:54,239
it said before it takes an encryption of

1635
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,880
G how does it relate to the trap door

1636
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:58,000
the C I'll tell you a say

1637
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:01,719
before we said g is just kind of the it

1638
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:04,040
has the it it just has the trapo in it

1639
01:11:01,719 --> 01:11:06,440
and before we said g is just this G

1640
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:10,120
computes bad and it has the trapo and we

1641
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:11,760
encrypt G now they say okay you're right

1642
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:14,520
there's a problem we'll tell you what G

1643
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,400
is in a second but same idea same idea

1644
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,560
we encrypt this G maybe it'll be a

1645
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:21,679
little different but we encrypt G and

1646
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:25,040
the hash function computes G and Alpha

1647
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:25,040
under the hood

1648
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:28,840
so it takes the original first message

1649
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:29,480
Alpa and computes the function gandra

1650
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:33,000
the

1651
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:34,640
hood I'm like we just went over through

1652
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,520
it it doesn't work what then you get the

1653
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,520
encryption doesn't even type check

1654
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:45,280
what so here's their

1655
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:50,719
idea okay now this is the most beautiful

1656
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:50,719
part of today's lecture okay so they

1657
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:56,120
say Okay so this think of this another

1658
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:59,600
let me just write it short short kind of

1659
01:11:56,120 --> 01:12:02,080
hand wve this is going to be G of alpha

1660
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,440
encrypted right because this is what U

1661
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:07,080
does U does it computes g of alpha so

1662
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:10,440
what you get back is encryption of G of

1663
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:12,080
alpha now they say okay and by the way

1664
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,679
in their scheme let me first say in

1665
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:16,320
their scheme what is g doesn't matter

1666
01:12:14,679 --> 01:12:18,560
because it's encrypted it's the all zero

1667
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,960
Circuit of a certain size so in their

1668
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,960
scheme this G is going to be the all

1669
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,880
zero

1670
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:26,360
Circuit of size like T Zer what T is

1671
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,520
we'll see in a

1672
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:30,920
second okay but that's all it is that's

1673
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,159
the hash this is the F hash function the

1674
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,880
question is why is it secure because it

1675
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:36,760
seems like there's no way this works but

1676
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,280
let me just say again the the F your

1677
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:42,719
hash function what does it

1678
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:44,920
do it generates a public key it encrypts

1679
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:48,440
in the actual scheme to all zero string

1680
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:50,280
to 00 Z up to T times we'll see what T

1681
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,760
is in a second in the analysis we're

1682
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:54,920
going to play with this G but this is

1683
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,719
all this is what it is and when you give

1684
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:59,239
him Alpha it

1685
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:01,239
computes the circuit which is all the

1686
01:12:59,239 --> 01:13:04,199
all zero circuit under the hood that's

1687
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:07,040
all it does and that's the that's that's

1688
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:09,760
the B that's going to be the

1689
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:12,480
beta you should be very confused but

1690
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,480
I'll explain

1691
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:16,800
yeah just think the zero every

1692
01:13:15,239 --> 01:13:20,400
everything is I don't know whatever it

1693
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:22,480
doesn't matter it all pluses all plus

1694
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:24,480
Gates or it actually doesn't matter

1695
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:28,080
because nobody's going to ever decrypted

1696
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:30,440
so it you just so I I I guess I'm saying

1697
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:33,360
each circuit you can describe it with

1698
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:37,840
kind of bit Z one0 one01 in some some

1699
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:38,960
way you know so put all zero bits so I

1700
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:42,280
don't know if it even describes a

1701
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:45,280
circuit just just

1702
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:45,280
yeah

1703
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:54,320
origin the has some CC that gamma as a

1704
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:57,040
function of beta just do that under F

1705
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,040
and get

1706
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:03,600
GMA and no I'll tell you why it doesn't

1707
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:05,520
work okay good no great question so the

1708
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,920
question was the following you're saying

1709
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:10,679
you know what change the protocol Al

1710
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:14,239
together you change this protocol and

1711
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:16,880
ask the guy put on put like don't you

1712
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:19,639
don't need to be you know blinded to

1713
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:23,760
this F Paradigm change it a little bit

1714
01:14:19,639 --> 01:14:26,199
and CH now you put a a encryption of of

1715
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:28,040
the trapdoor tell this guy so now he

1716
01:14:26,199 --> 01:14:29,960
computes bet under the hood tell him to

1717
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:32,159
compute G also under the hood and then

1718
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:34,480
we we don't have a problem the problem

1719
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:38,560
is that he can cheat why because when he

1720
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:38,560
answers GMA he knows the

1721
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:44,600
trapo but no he but actually one second

1722
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:48,880
you're right under the hood he knows the

1723
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:50,960
trapo yeah so hey hold

1724
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:56,679
on yeah the problem is that under the

1725
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:56,679
hood he knows the trapo however um

1726
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:02,000
I'm not sure actually that that's a

1727
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:06,560
problem because at that

1728
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:11,080
point let me think for a second

1729
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:13,360
um I think it actually may work uh okay

1730
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:15,400
so look it changes the protocol for

1731
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:18,000
example now it's no longer publicly

1732
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:20,520
verifiable because you need to now his

1733
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,320
message is encrypted so you need to

1734
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:26,280
decrypt in order to learn it so there

1735
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:28,840
there are uh issues with these but also

1736
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:33,239
I'll tell you more than

1737
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:35,920
that if indeed you put in the F in the

1738
01:15:33,239 --> 01:15:38,280
actual in the actual scheme you should

1739
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,679
think of it the people who generate feir

1740
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:43,159
they actually don't know the

1741
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:44,639
trapo they don't know the trapo someone

1742
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:46,159
there's a scheme in it swn and there is

1743
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:47,400
a trap door but nobody knows it and the

1744
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:49,679
people they don't actually know the

1745
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:52,000
trapo so in the actual scheme there

1746
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:54,080
won't be an encryption of the trapo it's

1747
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
in kind of the idea is will say well the

1748
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,320
actual you don't use the trap door but

1749
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,639
it's indistinguishable you don't know if

1750
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:00,120
you encrypted zero encrypted the trap

1751
01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:01,800
door so we're going to prove soundness

1752
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,960
assuming you encrypt the trap door but

1753
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:05,199
in the scheme you won't encrypt the

1754
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,480
trapo so then in the scheme the gun is

1755
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:07,840
going to be useless kind of because it

1756
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:12,239
won't

1757
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:14,960
correspond yeah okay great so okay great

1758
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:17,400
great great questions so where are we so

1759
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,600
we said here's the F has function the F

1760
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:22,840
hash function will take actually an

1761
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:24,120
arbitrary G of a certain size it doesn't

1762
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:26,040
matter because nobody's going to cryp

1763
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:28,120
that surface cyppher text

1764
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:29,760
anyway and all it will do is a

1765
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:33,120
computation under the

1766
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:35,880
hood and now it seems like I don't know

1767
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:37,480
it seems like that cannot work

1768
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,120
nevertheless I'm going to prove Security

1769
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:42,199
in like two

1770
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:44,920
lines it's uh okay and the proof is like

1771
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:47,159
ingenious really this construction is

1772
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:48,600
very it's very tempting to try it just

1773
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:51,159
doesn't work that when you look at it's

1774
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:54,360
like okay and then what and then

1775
01:16:51,159 --> 01:16:57,040
what but here's their idea their idea is

1776
01:16:54,360 --> 01:17:02,480
following all we need to

1777
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:06,639
argue is that for every Alpha G of

1778
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:06,639
alpha is not bit

1779
01:17:07,639 --> 01:17:11,080
bad that's all we

1780
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:18,280
need so then in the

1781
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:20,000
analysis I'm going to say so again this

1782
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:22,520
is the actual hash function we have an

1783
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:25,400
encryption here of G what G this G is I

1784
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:26,840
don't care it's like the fixed circuit

1785
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:28,600
whatever Circle you want to put and

1786
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:30,239
nobody's going to Crypt it in the

1787
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,920
analysis I'm going to say you know what

1788
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:37,880
I'm going to replace this G with a very

1789
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:41,320
special G with the G whose encryption is

1790
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:41,320
not b

1791
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:45,120
bad but you're

1792
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:54,320
like which G hat which G hat how do we

1793
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:57,800
construct a g so that we know that

1794
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:59,360
encryption of G and Alpha is not

1795
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,760
beta

1796
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,760
Yeah question what does this notation

1797
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,679
like is like an encryption of G like

1798
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,440
it's the head of the whole thing yeah

1799
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:11,000
this yeah sorry yeah yeah yeah yeah

1800
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:14,719
sorry this this is a a

1801
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:18,480
encryption of with public key of G Alpha

1802
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:18,480
yes sorry thanks thank

1803
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:26,560
you so any idea what uh

1804
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:32,600
okay I'll tell you you won't believe me

1805
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,360
but I'll tell you anyway it's it's MTH

1806
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:36,440
of course you'll believe but you'll

1807
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:38,440
you'll be mind-boggled for a while so

1808
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:41,840
here's their idea the idea is they say

1809
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:46,760
okay here's my G I need to ensure that

1810
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:46,760
you're not beta so I'm going to make my

1811
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:51,000
G B the

1812
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:56,639
decryption secret key of beta

1813
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:01,719
and I'm just going to add like the one

1814
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:03,280
to it so I know you're not like I guess

1815
01:19:01,719 --> 01:19:06,320
we're I'll rightor because we're over

1816
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:08,880
Zer one alexo this with one that's my G

1817
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:10,840
in the analysis so in the analysis I'm

1818
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,159
going to say suppose you succeed in

1819
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:15,960
Breaking the fure mirr you're also going

1820
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:18,000
to succeed with this G because it's

1821
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,920
encrypted you don't know the difference

1822
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,320
you don't if you have no idea what's

1823
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:23,120
underneath the cipher attack underneath

1824
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:25,760
the encryption so you should also

1825
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:28,840
succeed in Breaking with this G now this

1826
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:31,560
G looks bizarre because I'm decrypting

1827
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:33,480
this is not a cyer text this is just a

1828
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:35,520
bunch of strings like a z one string

1829
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:37,120
it's a random string it's not a cyer Tex

1830
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,480
what does it mean to decrypt this thing

1831
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,480
it's like this makes no

1832
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:47,239
sense

1833
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:49,040
however so but okay but but if this the

1834
01:19:47,239 --> 01:19:50,719
length of this is the the take a cyh

1835
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:52,360
protect that the length is like these

1836
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:55,199
Lambda

1837
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:56,880
bits so you can look this is function so

1838
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:59,440
you can compute this function not on a

1839
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:02,600
cipher text but compute this

1840
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:04,199
function okay so I decrypt the beta

1841
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:06,800
message which is not even a Cypher text

1842
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:07,960
and I add one I exort with one I exort

1843
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,040
with anything that's not zero just to

1844
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:11,040
Move It from the

1845
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:17,040
bad now I want to

1846
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:19,480
argue now we know that encryption of

1847
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:24,280
this cannot be

1848
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:25,480
beta why now now I can argue this why

1849
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:29,120
because

1850
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:31,520
if it was equal if you decrypt

1851
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:33,080
this then you'll get a decryption of

1852
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,840
this if you have two strings and they're

1853
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:36,040
equal if you decrypt one you can apply

1854
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:37,159
decryption for but they'll still be

1855
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,400
equal the decryption is just a

1856
01:20:37,159 --> 01:20:40,239
deterministic

1857
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,360
function

1858
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:49,360
so so I guess if I want to argue now

1859
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:52,120
with if for this G I want to argue

1860
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:54,040
that this which is the F function on

1861
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:58,760
Alpha this is the F your function on

1862
01:20:54,040 --> 01:21:01,360
Alpha I want to argue this if I want to

1863
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:02,679
argue if if it was beta I'm going to get

1864
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:04,880
a

1865
01:21:02,679 --> 01:21:08,120
contradiction I want to argue it's not

1866
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:12,520
beta why if it

1867
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:14,960
was then I can apply decryption on both

1868
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:18,760
sides then it means that decryption of

1869
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:20,719
this will be equal to decryption of

1870
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:25,840
this of

1871
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:25,840
course okay what is decryption of this

1872
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:31,560
G

1873
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:34,920
Alpha so I just decrypt the encryption

1874
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,920
of of G Alpha I get back G

1875
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:40,800
Alpha but I know G Alpha is not the

1876
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:43,840
decryption of bad

1877
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:49,760
Alpha because G is

1878
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:49,760
thetion not plus one so it can't

1879
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:59,800
be so again in the analysis so let me

1880
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:02,560
maybe write this a bit formally so where

1881
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,560
let me write it up

1882
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:13,920
there I'll use this part so here's the

1883
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:16,400
actual proof of SEC of soundness so

1884
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:19,719
suppose oh there's a sorry there's one

1885
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,719
thing I glossed over

1886
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,480
fast okay we'll go over it and then

1887
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:27,719
analysis we'll see it so I say Suppose

1888
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,719
there

1889
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:31,920
exist poly science cheating

1890
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:41,080
prover and he fixes some graph G that's

1891
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:42,320
not does not have a hamiltonian cycle

1892
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:46,400
and

1893
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:46,400
cheats and successfully and

1894
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:53,600
cheats with probability you know big

1895
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:56,440
let's say greater than Epsilon Epsilon

1896
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,440
is not negligible

1897
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:07,320
then I'm going to say let me then I want

1898
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:07,320
ARG then it means that P star also

1899
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:11,800
succeeds with

1900
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,159
probability you

1901
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:17,880
know I said

1902
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:20,719
close X may be minus negligible but

1903
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:25,960
similar probability if I change the hash

1904
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:29,000
key before the hash key was public key

1905
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:32,159
and some encryption of some bogus

1906
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:34,560
G now I say it will also succeed if I

1907
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:35,760
take public key and this specific G let

1908
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:40,960
me call this

1909
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:43,400
G G Star okay so that's the G in the

1910
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:45,480
analysis so again how does the analysis

1911
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:49,360
go I say Suppose there exists a cheating

1912
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:53,000
prover that takes a false statement and

1913
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:55,239
succeeds in in proving nevertheless and

1914
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,880
convincing then I want want to say that

1915
01:23:55,239 --> 01:24:01,320
he will also succeed If instead of

1916
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:04,679
giving public the if the with will also

1917
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:10,679
succeed with hash

1918
01:24:04,679 --> 01:24:10,679
key which is public key and

1919
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:15,840
encryption of gar of this

1920
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:20,840
gar Why by semantic

1921
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:23,159
security okay because you don't you

1922
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:25,360
can't distinguish between encryption

1923
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:28,360
encryption of gar ition of

1924
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:30,600
G

1925
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:31,560
yeah we're using the fact that the proof

1926
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:33,719
is

1927
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:35,400
efficient computational soundness

1928
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:38,159
computational soundness yes we're using

1929
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:39,880
the fact that the CH polyes he's

1930
01:24:38,159 --> 01:24:41,480
efficient and therefore he cannot break

1931
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:44,320
semantic security so we cannot

1932
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:45,800
distinguish between g whatever the bogus

1933
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:50,080
G that we put in the CRS for the all

1934
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:50,080
zero circuit or whatever and this G

1935
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:56,800
Star I cheated slightly here but let me

1936
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:59,360
move on and we'll go to the cheat in a

1937
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:01,360
second okay but let's say you believe

1938
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:04,880
that even though you shouldn't but it's

1939
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:07,880
very delicate so we'll go there but but

1940
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:10,600
okay semantic security now I'm saying

1941
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:12,960
with this G Star now information

1942
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:15,119
theoretically cannot cheat he's stuck

1943
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:19,679
because guess what for every you're

1944
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:21,639
saying he he produces Alpha Beta gamma

1945
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:24,920
accepting right that's what he means he

1946
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:28,000
cheated so he got it means that

1947
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:30,320
he got Alpha so that h of alpha is

1948
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,199
bad because you can only cheat with a

1949
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,960
bad Alpha that's the definition of bad

1950
01:25:32,199 --> 01:25:36,440
of a bad beta that's the definition of a

1951
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:38,800
bad beta one that you can treat with so

1952
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:39,679
he found an alpha said that h of alpha

1953
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:44,600
is

1954
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:47,119
bad but this G Star never hits bad that

1955
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:50,320
that's how we made it it's so that g of

1956
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:51,960
alpha is never the bad alha

1957
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:55,199
yeah

1958
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:58,239
Ah that's what I glossed over exactly L

1959
01:25:55,199 --> 01:26:01,320
good good good so that's the proof

1960
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:03,560
however there is a cheat and the cheat

1961
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:07,000
is look

1962
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:10,280
gar to compute gar I said just describe

1963
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,440
gar like G when I when I mean encrypt

1964
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:15,080
gar I mean give the description like

1965
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:18,520
encrypt the description of gar okay so

1966
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:20,840
let's recall what does gar do gar

1967
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:24,600
decrypts so you need to know the secret

1968
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:27,639
key corresponding to public key

1969
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:29,600
we said that like you can encrypt you

1970
01:26:27,639 --> 01:26:31,440
semantic security holds for any fixed

1971
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:35,840
messages m0 and

1972
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,840
M1 you cannot distinguish

1973
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:45,000
between is it here yeah for any fixed m0

1974
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:47,760
and M1 you cannot distinguish between

1975
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,400
encryption of m0 and encryption of M1

1976
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,639
but here I'm saying you C cannot

1977
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:54,520
distinguish between encryption of the

1978
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:59,600
secret key and encryption of let's say

1979
01:26:54,520 --> 01:27:04,600
other bits that's a different story and

1980
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:08,560
indeed we assume what's called circular

1981
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:10,199
secure FHA so we assume not only that

1982
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:13,360
you can we assume all that you cannot

1983
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:15,040
distinction encryption of the secret key

1984
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:19,080
and encryption of the all zeros that's

1985
01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:22,239
an assumption do you have question

1986
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:26,360
yeah so far it seems

1987
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:28,320
likea beta so

1988
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:31,520
given not

1989
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:33,199
computed like how do we oh no no no no

1990
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,480
it's computed sorry sorry sorry okay

1991
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:36,560
good good good no what I meant here okay

1992
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:39,639
thanks thank you very much for the

1993
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:42,880
question here's what gar Alpha does gar

1994
01:27:39,639 --> 01:27:45,560
of alpha it has actually let me write

1995
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:49,760
more more carefully it

1996
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:52,560
has trapo and secret key hard wire the

1997
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:56,679
first thing it does it computes bad it

1998
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:56,679
computes bad Alpha using

1999
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:03,000
trapo this is kind of corresponding to

2000
01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:05,280
our to our scheme then he takes what he

2001
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:08,280
got the bad Alpha he decrypt it using

2002
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:09,679
the secret key then he exor one to the

2003
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:12,679
least significant bit or something like

2004
01:28:09,679 --> 01:28:15,280
that so yeah it does compute it yeah so

2005
01:28:12,679 --> 01:28:17,600
this G Star you need to encrypt trapo

2006
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:18,920
and you need to encrypt secret key now

2007
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,440
encrypting the trap door is not a

2008
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:22,880
problem it's has nothing to do with the

2009
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:25,119
key but the problem is you also need to

2010
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,800
encrypt the secret key correspond to the

2011
01:28:25,119 --> 01:28:29,320
public

2012
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:31,800
key but yeah thank you for the question

2013
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:33,920
that's a great question so you know GF I

2014
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:37,880
want to repeat gar Alpha what it does it

2015
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:39,320
do it takes Alpha it first computes the

2016
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:41,639
bad beta corresponding to the alpha

2017
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:44,000
using the the trap door then he takes

2018
01:28:41,639 --> 01:28:46,560
this string he decrypts this weird

2019
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,880
string using the secret key and then he

2020
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:50,360
exors it with like ex the least

2021
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:54,600
significant bit with one or any bit with

2022
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:57,280
one just to make it not equal

2023
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:59,000
police is it still the secret key it's

2024
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:01,239
the secret key corresponding to this

2025
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,480
commitment that's why I said this track

2026
01:29:01,239 --> 01:29:06,639
door in some is also a secret public

2027
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:09,800
encryption but there's two there's two

2028
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:12,840
encryptions going on one is the FHA

2029
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:13,719
encryption and one is how we implement

2030
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:15,920
this

2031
01:29:13,719 --> 01:29:17,480
commitment so you're right that we

2032
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,480
implement this commitment also with an

2033
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:21,040
encryption scheme but it's better to

2034
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:22,360
kind of forget it because otherwise it's

2035
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:24,400
confusing that there's two encryption

2036
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:25,800
scheme so here I want to say suppose you

2037
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:27,920
have a commitment and there's a trap

2038
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:30,080
door that allows you to open it forget

2039
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:32,440
that this trap is also a secret key

2040
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:34,400
because so now I'm saying you need this

2041
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:35,800
trapo to open the commitment which

2042
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:38,199
you're right this trap door happens also

2043
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:40,960
to beat some encrypt secret key because

2044
01:29:38,199 --> 01:29:43,400
that's how we implemented the

2045
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:47,239
commitment and it has the secret key

2046
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:49,840
corresponding to this same public key

2047
01:29:47,239 --> 01:29:53,199
you see so I guess what's the

2048
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:56,520
problematic part is that the hatch key

2049
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:58,239
consists of a public key of a fully

2050
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:03,639
homomorphic encryption

2051
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:06,239
scheme and to to describe gar you need

2052
01:30:03,639 --> 01:30:08,040
to describe you need to hard you need

2053
01:30:06,239 --> 01:30:09,400
the trapdoor which is not a problem you

2054
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:11,000
could just encrypt this trapo under

2055
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:13,000
public heat fresh public key you can

2056
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,280
encrypt any this is kind of fixed

2057
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:17,280
compared to this public key but you also

2058
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:19,280
need to encrypt the secret key

2059
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:22,760
corresponding to this public

2060
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:25,119
key and for that we need to rely on

2061
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:27,199
circular security

2062
01:30:25,119 --> 01:30:28,520
so let me just quickly write what I mean

2063
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:32,119
by circular

2064
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:34,520
security and then we'll break so I'll

2065
01:30:32,119 --> 01:30:34,520
write it

2066
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:50,880
here it just means that public key and

2067
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:54,040
encryption of the secret

2068
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:57,360
key is indistinguishable

2069
01:30:54,040 --> 01:31:00,800
from public key and

2070
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:04,840
encryption of let's say the all

2071
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:07,239
zeros and let me just mention the secret

2072
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:09,679
key here you can think of it as Lambda

2073
01:31:07,239 --> 01:31:12,400
bits let's say security per number of

2074
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:14,920
bits then when you know if we think of

2075
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:16,520
bitwise encryption this is encryption of

2076
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,719
it's like encryption of secret key the

2077
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:20,639
first bit of secret key encryption of

2078
01:31:17,719 --> 01:31:22,600
the second bit it's like Lambda

2079
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:24,119
encryptions and this also I mean

2080
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:25,840
encryption of zero encryption of Zer

2081
01:31:24,119 --> 01:31:29,440
encryption of zero we do everything bit

2082
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:32,360
by bit and the assumption is that you

2083
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:35,600
have an FH scheme so that you cannot

2084
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:39,320
distinguish between whether the Lambda

2085
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:41,199
encryptions each one bit encrypts a bit

2086
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:42,719
whether these encryptions are all zero

2087
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:43,920
or whether they correspond to the bits

2088
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:46,159
of the secret

2089
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:48,800
key so that's an

2090
01:31:46,159 --> 01:31:52,440
assumption uh by the

2091
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:54,679
way we do we we know so the question is

2092
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:57,080
well do we have FH that have that are

2093
01:31:54,679 --> 01:31:59,440
have circular security question mark

2094
01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:01,679
well we do under an assumption it's

2095
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:03,760
called circular secure learning with air

2096
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:06,480
so we just move this kind of circular

2097
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:09,080
secure into the Assumption we believe

2098
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:11,760
this assumption to be true we don't know

2099
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:13,440
but actually we can remove all this we

2100
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,080
actually don't it turns out we don't

2101
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:17,159
need to put the secret key there and

2102
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:20,800
there's a follow-up work that kind of

2103
01:32:17,159 --> 01:32:22,400
did more work a lot of lattice work so

2104
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:25,239
you need to kind of really here I didn't

2105
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,520
talk at all about l I mean as long as

2106
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:28,480
you have fully morphic encryption that

2107
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:30,760
Circle are secure we're all set I don't

2108
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:32,560
care how what this is like but then

2109
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:34,719
there's follow-up work that looks at the

2110
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:36,520
specific kind of polymorphic encryption

2111
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:39,040
scheme based on lates and does a bunch

2112
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:41,000
of lattice tricks to remove the circular

2113
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,800
need for circular security so this is

2114
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:45,840
something we I I didn't show you but

2115
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:49,159
there's a follow-up work uh that does

2116
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:50,719
that okay so I want to take a break but

2117
01:32:49,159 --> 01:32:53,560
if before a break are there any

2118
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:56,520
questions yeah the SI of the circuit has

2119
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:58,520
to large enough to contain this specific

2120
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:59,840
good exactly so good good good question

2121
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:01,400
very good question guys you're really

2122
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:04,880
having fantastic questions today thank

2123
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:06,199
you so going back what is this T this T

2124
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,360
is the number of bits needed to

2125
01:33:06,199 --> 01:33:10,360
represent this G Star because in the

2126
01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:14,159
analysis I

2127
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:16,280
convert the zero to the T with G star

2128
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:18,119
with the description of of G Star so

2129
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:21,119
this is exactly what T is in the

2130
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:21,119
analysis

2131
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:31,400
any any further

2132
01:33:28,719 --> 01:33:33,119
questions okay so let's take like maybe

2133
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:35,320
I don't know eight minute break feel was

2134
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:38,440
intense takes like eight minute break or

2135
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:41,560
so uh and uh when we'll go back we'll do

2136
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:41,560
the niic
