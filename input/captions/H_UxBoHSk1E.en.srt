1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,599
Okay. Hello everyone. Uh I presented

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,240
earlier today in in the the morning

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,400
session. I'm a professor in ECS and

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,800
Seesale as well as a co-founder of this

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,560
company Nectri. And basically the

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,800
problem we're trying to solve is that

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,320
there's on the one hand so much value to

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
being able to customize software

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,160
solutions in the context of particular

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,640
companies, but it's extremely expensive

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,400
and slow to do that customization. Today

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,320
you can use old school software

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,079
engineering efforts which requires

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,920
attracting people with with rare talents

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,680
who are constantly being pulled away by

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,760
by big tech companies. Uh or you can use

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,320
AI enabled tools to streamline that

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,719
process. You can use uh more old school

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,719
low code and no code tools. All these

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,960
have some significant challenges. If we

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,039
want to make it really streamlined so

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,199
that people who are not the top software

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,960
engineers can create customizations for

24
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,199
important software packages used within

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,680
a company and maintain them over time at

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,920
a reasonable

27
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,840
cost. So Nectrie is presenting a

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,560
platform to uh kind of get the best of

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,080
all those worlds where without requiring

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,159
software engineering effort you can

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,040
customize the software as a service

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,720
tools that you depend on. It's built on

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,479
a bunch of really cool deep technology.

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,400
I don't have time to tell you about, but

35
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,960
definitely stop by our our table where

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,720
my my co-founders will be manning the

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,040
the demo since I have to go off and

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,200
teach shortly after this this talk. Uh,

39
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,640
but it has Google compilers technology

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
both streamlines development and

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,159
produces higher quality software

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,720
solutions in the end and dimensions like

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,680
performance and security. But the the

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,000
one key idea I I want to get across here

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,320
is that the way NERI works is by

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,040
developing a novel architecture of

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,520
highlevel reusable components standing

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,520
for features that make sense to regular

49
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,360
people who are not software engineers.

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,680
Every component encapsulates inside of

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,840
it the full stack of features needed in

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,840
a production quality web application,

53
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,119
front end, backend, and database. So you

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,799
can snap them together without even

55
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,680
knowing what those words mean and get

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,759
complete solutions quickly.

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,440
And these components are very high level

58
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,200
compared to what you'll see in in other

59
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,080
platforms. They can be something like a

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,680
connector to an existing SAS tool. But

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
even more interestingly, they can stand

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,760
for a a familiar feature like a ticket

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,440
system or a data integration process.

64
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,720
You can just invoke those by name,

65
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,120
explain how to connect them to your

66
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,760
data, and then our platform generates

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,080
the rest of the the code for a working

68
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,560
application.

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,640
And we of course have our own AI enabled

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,959
front end like like uh many other tools

71
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,800
these days. So you can chat with an LLM,

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,480
but instead of coming up with thousands

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,080
of lines of Python code or something

74
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,000
like that, you're coming up with a very

75
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,680
short description of picking some blocks

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,280
out of our library and plugging them

77
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,440
together. Humans can read it and check

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,120
that something reasonable came out. And

79
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,239
then once it's written, the process of

80
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,160
producing the production ready

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,160
application from there doesn't use AI

82
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,800
anymore. It's extremely predictable and

83
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,360
reliable.

84
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,879
We also have a compiler that takes

85
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,640
applications written in this way where

86
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,159
naively you'd think data is following a

87
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,760
windy path through all these building

88
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,680
blocks you're plugging together. Our

89
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,920
compiler straightens out those paths,

90
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,159
removes the overhead of abstraction and

91
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,760
produces code in line in performance

92
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,680
with what an expert developer would

93
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,360
write. So one example I want to

94
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,519
highlight, we'll be showcasing it at at

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,000
our table later. It was for a customer

96
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,200
that uses like so many of us SAP Concur

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,760
for handling expense report

98
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,040
reimbursement. and Concur didn't

99
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,560
understand some of the details of how

100
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,080
their company works. So, there were

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,080
there were some commonalities in every

102
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
expense report that was filed, wasting

103
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,080
the time of their employees filling out

104
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,959
all these highly predictable elements of

105
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,040
of of trips and and meals and so forth.

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,480
We worked with them to understand the

107
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,120
commonalities across their expense

108
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,840
reports and build a an AI powered tool

109
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,360
that is able to uh apply exactly the

110
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,200
right rules for their context and save

111
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,120
everyone time.

112
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,360
So overall, we're here looking for

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,280
design partners could be from uh

114
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,280
companies around the world who are

115
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,519
interested in using tools like this to

116
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,519
help them maintain internal software

117
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,040
solutions that are perfectly tailored to

118
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,879
their their needs without needing

119
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,480
software engineering effort to make that

120
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,680
work. Uh we're interested in all kinds

121
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,840
of industries though two we've been

122
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,680
looking at especially closely so far are

123
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,680
biioarma and finance. Thank you.

124
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,960
Okay. Um um I have a question. I um work

125
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,240
in fidelity and um there are a lot of uh

126
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,479
frameworks and guidelines when building

127
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:40,639
individual architectural layers like

128
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:43,120
um there is a state management platform.

129
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:48,320
There is context management platform. We

130
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:50,160
use GraphQL uh to get to data and um

131
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,360
it's just experiencing we use

132
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,040
microservices. We use data jobs how you

133
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,880
can apply the different types of

134
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,520
guidelines and how you can customize it.

135
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,440
Right. So uh Nectri can connect to

136
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,880
existing external services and I think

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,039
some of the examples you mentioned fall

138
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,560
into that category. uh our our goal

139
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,960
though this isn't fully implemented yet

140
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,199
is you can point nectry to your say

141
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,360
web-based documentation for some kind of

142
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,639
micros service and then it ingests that

143
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,720
and figures out how it works and then

144
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,160
makes it available within our platform

145
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,680
and then a further layer on top of that

146
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,560
when you think about security and

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,479
privacy and regulatory considerations we

148
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,000
have a framework for describing policies

149
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,479
about what information is allowed to

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,800
flow between uh those existing services

151
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,960
in what ways and the a small team of

152
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
technical experts can curate a library

153
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,880
of policies like that which are then

154
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,240
automatically enforced for the solutions

155
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,600
being created by people who are the

156
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,280
experts on the specific business

157
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,479
processes that they're automating.

158
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,479
We have time for one more

159
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,280
question. Well um professor let me ask

160
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,600
you um how does nectry fit into the

161
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,520
landscape of AI based coding assistance

162
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,199
if you can expand on that a little more.

163
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,720
Yeah sure. So most coding assistants

164
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,039
these days are being used to write

165
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,680
programs in conventional languages like

166
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,000
Python or Java or something where the

167
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,039
artifact that the the the app developer

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,639
is negotiating on with the AI is uh

169
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,039
quite voluminous with all these lines of

170
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,440
code going into excruciating detail in

171
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,680
Nectri. Instead, the the app developer

172
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,440
is negotiating on a nice succinct

173
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,160
description of the app as just a

174
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,600
plugging together of a bunch of highle

175
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,960
reusable building blocks, which makes

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,199
for an end result that's much more

177
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,639
understandable to people and also more

178
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,560
understandable to machines, which lets

179
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,960
us do things like enforce security and

180
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,960
privacy rules.
