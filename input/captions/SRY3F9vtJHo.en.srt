1
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:25,080
okay ready for last hour okay before I I

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,080
start was this too slow too fast too

3
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,199
slow too

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,719
fast okay I have an idea everybody close

5
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,280
your

6
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:37,239
eyes okay now you have to say too slow

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,559
too fast or good okay no you need to

8
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:41,600
close your eyes everybody close your

9
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,280
eyes okay too

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,440
slow too

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:52,359
fast good

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:58,280
good okay okay thank you hands

13
00:00:52,359 --> 00:01:03,920
up oh what is it all good all good pass

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:06,119
okay uh okay great um okay so I want to

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,520
say first uh one thing I forgot to

16
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,119
mention about the sump of protocol that

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,920
we're actually use later it has a nice

18
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,240
property which is look at what so the

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,479
ver the PO sends polinomial low degree

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,479
polinomial what is the verier S the

21
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:23,119
verifier just SS random field elements

22
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,200
so really Randomness he chooses random

23
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:30,320
like log F bits and send them over okay

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,920
this is called a publicly a public coin

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,799
protocol public coin meaning the coins

26
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,920
of so each round the verifier chooses

27
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,399
coins and just sends them publicly to

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,560
the approver like here my log F coins

29
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:46,119
here they go this defines a field

30
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,759
element and that's my field element okay

31
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,040
uh this kind of Public public coin

32
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:55,040
Protocols are very useful because we can

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,280
later as we'll see in this class we can

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,399
use cryptography to eliminate this

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,600
interaction from this protocol so the

36
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,360
fact that it public coin will come back

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,319
to it okay but just notice the verifier

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:12,480
message is truly random okay uh one more

39
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:14,879
uh J yeah sorry just want is there are

40
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,239
there also protocols where theover

41
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,560
has good so you okay the qu so as I said

42
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,360
we mentioned the verifier has to be

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,800
randomized if it's not randomized the

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,000
interactive protocol has no power the

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,040
question here was does the prover need

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,480
to be randomized is it helpful if he's

47
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,080
randomized and the answer is is he I

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,959
mean it doesn't help him to be

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:40,760
randomized because you can always fix

50
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:43,920
his coins the verifier doesn't it's the

51
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,440
uh okay when does the when is it helpful

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,800
for the Prov to have Randomness when you

53
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,879
want to hide when we do zero knowledge

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,599
where the goal is kind of to hide thing

55
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,080
then the verifier has random coins that

56
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,040
the verifier doesn't know and that any

57
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,920
but in this case the verifier is not

58
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,000
we're not trying to protect the verifier

59
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,440
so why is Randomness is helpful from why

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
why is it important that the verifier

61
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:10,319
uses Randomness because the proof or

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,040
need send the poomi he should not know

63
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,599
which element T the pro the verifier

64
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,440
will say if he knew and which point T

65
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,519
will be asked then he can cheat he'll

66
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,879
give you a false pomal that happened to

67
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,720
coincide with a true poal and that point

68
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,799
T there D such points so he can choose

69
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,879
it he can choose the fake polinomial to

70
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,959
kind of coincide

71
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,120
the power comes from the fact that the

72
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:37,519
prover doesn't know this te so we don't

73
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,680
trust the prover and we use Randomness

74
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,959
kind of

75
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,120
against the verifier is trusted we're

76
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,360
not trying so it doesn't help the Prov

77
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,920
to use Randomness in a sense or in other

78
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,480
words you can just fix if you can fix

79
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,720
his Randomness once and for all for all

80
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,760
time think of him as kind of a

81
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,200
non-uniform prover and and that's it the

82
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,159
the verifier is not going to change his

83
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,760
behavior depending on because he's

84
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,680
honest it's the ver is always honest

85
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,079
it's the prover malicious prover that

86
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,480
we're worried about and therefore the

87
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:09,760
prover doesn't help him to he doesn't

88
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,079
need Randomness because you can always

89
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,040
hardwire the best Randomness possible to

90
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:18,199
him and now he's just a nonuniform kind

91
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,000
of machine as a circuit as opposed to

92
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,160
kind of a randomized machine so in this

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,520
context Randomness to the Prov is not

94
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,440
not needed the randomness of the

95
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,479
verifier par amount So when you say

96
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,759
public coin does that mean the can't see

97
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:35,039
those FS no public coin means that the

98
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:39,400
verifire doesn't hide anything he so

99
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:42,479
okay of course okay of course the prover

100
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,400
uh good question thank you the prover he

101
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,639
doesn't he never sees the coins in

102
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,320
advance so if he saw the coins before he

103
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:54,000
said anything he can cheat but the

104
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,440
verifier never hides coins to himself so

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,560
public coin means when the verifier said

106
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,160
the verifier just sends random coins so

107
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,600
I got I'm the verif

108
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,720
you you guys gave me a univer polinomial

109
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,960
a degree polinomial I choose coins a

110
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,880
field element that's kind of random

111
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,120
coins I send it over I don't keep any

112
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,639
state I don't it's all my messages are

113
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,360
just random you give me another poom

114
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,960
I'll just send Randomness that's the

115
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,319
definition of a public coin protocol

116
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:26,039
okay so public coin protocol just

117
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,039
means so no some check is a public coin

118
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,120
protocol which me means that

119
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,919
verifiers

120
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,199
messages are truly random just random

121
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,479
bits or if it's a

122
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,960
uniform I just had Randomness truly

123
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,720
uniform that's that's what public point

124
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,280
is yes um I guess like is it known what

125
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,120
happens if the pro does know all the

126
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,080
randomness in yeah yeah if the prover

127
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,199
knows all the randomness in advance he

128
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,560
can cheat why let me tell you how how

129
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,440
I'm going to cheat so I'm a cheating

130
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,080
prover let's say before you started

131
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,880
before we started you gave me all your

132
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,520
T1 up the TM actually even if you just

133
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,840
gave me T1 I'm golden why I I faked I

134
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,440
said the sum is B it's not beta it's

135
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,639
beta it's something

136
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,400
else now what all I want is to find a

137
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,360
pol a univariate

138
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,520
polinomial that sums to Beta so it's not

139
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,400
the true polom it sums to Beta but it

140
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,240
agrees with a true polinomial only on

141
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,880
T1 because once once it agrees with T1

142
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,960
from now on I need to prove a true

143
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,960
statement because I need to prove this

144
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,879
which is actually a true statement so

145
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,720
I'm good so if I knew T1 I can always

146
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,639
kind of come up with such a polinomial

147
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,000
the thing is I don't know what T1 is so

148
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,800
actually I want to give Jim actually

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,280
asked me a very good question in the

150
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,080
break and uh like he he I want to give

151
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,080
kind of Jin's geometric interpretation

152
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,160
of the soundness proof okay so let me

153
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,199
give you kind of a geometric

154
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,599
interpretation of why this protocol is

155
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,680
sound what's happening in this protocol

156
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:26,199
so here's the geometrical interpretation

157
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,759
we have a little box H to the m you can

158
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,639
think of it this is kind of the little

159
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,080
box H to the m I want to prove to you

160
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,080
that this low polinomial if you sum over

161
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,680
the value in this point this point all

162
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,240
these hm points it's beta now let's look

163
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,400
at the big F I have like this big

164
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,000
F

165
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:50,800
right okay now what happens if you were

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,199
incorrect if you cheated me then the sum

167
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,319
you you sum over all the points let's

168
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,639
fix this point here H like the one one

169
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,639
possible H1

170
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,479
maybe what you gave me is false what you

171
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:06,960
gave me is the sum is either false on H1

172
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,440
or an H2 somewhere it must be false

173
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,479
because it was true on everything will

174
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,800
be true so you give me something that's

175
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,520
false on one of them I don't know which

176
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,960
one now so what I know but but now I'm

177
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,080
going to use air cration to say well if

178
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,599
it was false on one of them it's false

179
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,759
on a random Point

180
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:28,440
T1 so now I forget about this sum I just

181
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:30,479
look at T1 and I know that the sum only

182
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,880
over the rest of the like the dimension

183
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,919
two it's false on

184
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,039
T1 and now again false and T1 that means

185
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,240
H2 one of them must be false I go to

186
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,680
kind of a random point in the extension

187
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,480
and there with Hy probility it's false

188
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:50,000
and kind of this is how I bop around

189
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,440
from kind of Dimensions T1 T2 Third

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,160
Dimension T3 T4 and so on up to the

191
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,560
point that I get a random point in kind

192
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,519
of after to there okay so that's kind of

193
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,440
a geometric interpretation of what's

194
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,440
going on

195
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,399
okay okay any any

196
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,000
questions for we okay so we saw this

197
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,040
subject so let's see where we are we

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,680
introduced this interactive interactive

199
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,600
proof model we saw subject protocol

200
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,279
seems kind of very specific let's try to

201
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,360
see why why it's very interesting the

202
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:26,600
subject protocol so first before

203
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,680
a as first thing let me give you an

204
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:33,399
example where where the Su check is is

205
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,399
useful and here's the

206
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:45,800
example let me show you that sharp set

207
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:48,440
has an interactive p i is the set of all

208
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,760
languages that have interactive proofs

209
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,800
so let me prove to you that sharp sa has

210
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,240
an interactive proof that's an example

211
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,680
this will use the Su check protocol by

212
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,000
the way let me just mention all the

213
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,560
examples that I'm giving you are not

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,120
just examples okay I'm teaching

215
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,200
something through it so don't just

216
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:08,000
example I'll I'll kind of forget about

217
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:10,279
it okay um they're specially crafted

218
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,360
okay so what is sharp set sharp set

219
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:16,760
we're giving a formula uh

220
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,399
fee and we're asking what is the number

221
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:22,000
of satisfying assignments to this

222
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,320
formula that's the question that's the

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,839
uh

224
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:32,079
a so so so Fe is you you think of it as

225
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,079
a Boolean formula we given a Boolean

226
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:42,399
formula let's say Fe is over like it

227
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,399
takes H sorry over let's say n

228
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,800
variables and buing formula I just think

229
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,320
of like it's and and

230
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:56,959
or and we have

231
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:00,399
not okay and the question is what when

232
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:04,320
how many assignments over 01 to the n

233
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,320
make this formula accept that's the

234
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:12,720
question okay so by the way um when we

235
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,639
say formula we mean it's a binary think

236
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,639
of it as a binary

237
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,560
tree so a formula is just a binary tree

238
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,440
each gate you can think of it as an and

239
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:28,560
or an or and then the final final leaves

240
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,000
are kind of all kind of XI or not XI

241
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,720
okay so Fe is of the following form it's

242
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,720
let's say and and then you can have or

243
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:43,399
or and so on so forth and the end it has

244
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:46,279
like X3 not X7 and so on so forth okay

245
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,560
so you can think of the size of this

246
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:49,760
formula is the number of leaves because

247
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,000
after to factor of two it's like the

248
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,839
number of gates the number of leaves

249
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,320
it's kind of the same uh okay so and

250
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,040
note just note many Le X3 may appear

251
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,760
many many many times because I really

252
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:06,120
opened it up to a tree okay so each

253
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,560
variable here can appear many many times

254
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,519
so this is what a formula is and sharp

255
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:16,079
side so now I want to say that let's say

256
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:20,320
Fe and K is in sharp

257
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:24,199
set it's in the language if and only if

258
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,680
Fe has so the number if you look at all

259
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:30,839
the x's in

260
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:35,920
01 to the end that of X is

261
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:38,079
one this set equals K okay if there's

262
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,079
exactly K satisfying

263
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:44,440
assignments okay questions about this

264
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:46,240
language threat we're good okay I just

265
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,480
want to point out a formula is different

266
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,920
than a circuit in the sense that the

267
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,199
formula is a tree it's a binary tree a

268
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:57,560
circuit is kind of an arbitrary uh ayli

269
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:59,760
directed acylic graph okay in particular

270
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,079
in um in a in

271
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,800
circuit kind in the formula you need to

272
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,560
kind of recompute everything so if this

273
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,839
gate uses a value and this gate also

274
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,320
uses the same value you need to

275
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,360
recompute it you need to compute it kind

276
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,320
of twice in a circuit can do things much

277
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,720
more efficiently okay so there's also

278
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,959
circuit set that's a sharp circuit set

279
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,160
that's a different problem here we

280
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,120
talking about sharp set for formulas

281
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,600
okay for

282
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:31,079
trees okay so uh I'm going to give you

283
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:34,000
actually so so this is a

284
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,240
uh known to be a very hard problem you

285
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,839
know I'm giving you like think of three

286
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,560
set you know going be complete now look

287
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,279
at the number like 10p but number like

288
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,040
how you know how many satisfying

289
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:48,480
assignments it has it's considered a

290
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,680
very hard problem um but uh you know if

291
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,959
you think about it's really surprising

292
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,880
that you can give an interactive proof

293
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,120
for it which is really nice and moreover

294
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,839
the interactive proof is really just the

295
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,600
subject that's all that's all it is so

296
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:05,040
I'm I'm going to show you how I embed

297
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,600
this kind of question into a

298
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,519
su okay and not that this is just a

299
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,600
Boolean formula where's the polinomial

300
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,160
where's uh you know I'm going to make a

301
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,360
some check but to have some Che I need a

302
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,440
polinomial and this is just a Boolean

303
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,000
formula so the way the idea is to use

304
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm going to use Sun check for this IP

305
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,600
and the way I'm going to use Sun check

306
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:28,320
is by a technique called arithmetization

307
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,600
which we'll use okay so I'm going to so

308
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,519
the idea of using subject or the idea

309
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,079
behind this

310
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:36,079
IP is to

311
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:42,360
arithmetization

312
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,639
Fe okay so I want to prove to you that

313
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,199
Fe Kam is in sharp set I want to I want

314
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,160
to use a su Che protocol that's the only

315
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,519
protocol I know and I want to use it but

316
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,120
I need a polinomial so how I need to

317
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,600
polinomial and the sum over this

318
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,920
polinomial what is this polinomial it's

319
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,680
going to be an arithmetization

320
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,120
of the S formula so how do I ariti the

321
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,920
idea is very very simple I'm going to

322
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,040
convert any so this is a bull this is

323
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,560
booing all over 01 yeah I have and and

324
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,560
or everything is over 01 I'm going to

325
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,880
convert an end

326
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,240
gate

327
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,199
into Mal

328
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,240
gate okay so actually fix any finite

329
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,600
field you can make it very very B so

330
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,480
you'll have good soundness so okay with

331
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,480
respect

332
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,680
to field finite field F so fits any

333
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,319
finite

334
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,959
field okay can be very

335
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:48,360
large I'm going to convert any Mal any

336
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:50,680
and gate into a multiplication gate so

337
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:55,680
malt is

338
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:57,240
just take X and Y and just output x * y

339
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,399
in the

340
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,480
field okay but in particular what it

341
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:05,120
means if it there's anything time Z is

342
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,519
zero and 1 * 1 is one it's exactly an an

343
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,519
and gate okay if I have an

344
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,199
orgate

345
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,120
into so this is a bit more problem so

346
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,720
this is going to be so actually let me

347
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,519
say maybe I'll write it so I'm G to

348
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:26,560
write

349
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:29,560
and of XY I'm just going to write as x *

350
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,560
y

351
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,600
and I'm going to write

352
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:40,279
or of X and

353
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:42,199
Y any idea yeah X Y X Y exactly exactly

354
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:47,560
X Plus y That's idea but of course then

355
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:50,880
it's two I mean so I subtract x * y

356
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,680
exactly okay so of course zero goes to

357
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,279
zero if only one of them is one you get

358
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,600
one and zero nothing and if both of them

359
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:02,120
are one then this one is one so it takes

360
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,120
care of good and then that the

361
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:13,919
not not I go into not of X is simply

362
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:16,520
what exactly one - x so now I have

363
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,319
actually an arithmetic circuit okay so

364
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:22,439
this arithmetization allowed me to go

365
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:25,480
from a circuit into an arithmetic

366
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:28,240
circuit or from a formula sorry into an

367
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,559
arithmetic circuit and now note let's

368
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,000
look at the

369
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:36,960
first note that each a

370
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,520
gate is now an arithmetic Circuit of ss

371
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,600
at most three right it's a tiny circuit

372
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,240
like this is so each gate really I is

373
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,440
only con blw up by only a

374
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,200
constant and now really what I want to

375
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,120
do the subject over my protocol what I

376
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,440
want is to look at so let's denote the

377
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,039
arithmetization

378
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,039
by so if we denote

379
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,520
Ari

380
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,520
metiz

381
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,480
formula by

382
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,360
flda okay so F that goes from F to the N

383
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,799
to F it's just addition multiplication

384
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,039
can Define over the big F yes I'm wor

385
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:29,280
that since or now like has X twice and Y

386
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,080
twice since you said it has to be a tree

387
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,080
like you have to like copy and paste why

388
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,440
in order to like plug it into that okay

389
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,120
actually I don't care we'll see you're

390
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,960
saying what you're saying wait why is a

391
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,360
middle why is I start all I cares that I

392
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,919
started with an arith with a formula I

393
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,600
don't care in the middle what I do with

394
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,679
it so right now it's not a formula

395
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,679
anymore yeah oh

396
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,720
sorry good thank

397
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,880
you good thank you very much

398
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,880
thank

399
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,360
you great well you guys are good thank

400
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,360
you okay so let's denote the

401
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,360
arithmetization

402
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,799
in

403
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:38,799
01 is equal to

404
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:41,480
K why that make sense the only thing we

405
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,880
need to be careful with is what is the

406
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,840
degree of this

407
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,120
thing so now let's just argue that the

408
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,880
degree is not too

409
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,200
big okay but if if I convince that the

410
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,679
degree is small then we're done we just

411
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,000
do a su check and this is exactly what

412
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,400
you want to prove

413
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,960
okay so let's just make sure that the

414
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,960
degree so n here like the number of R is

415
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,320
going to be n there's going to be a

416
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,320
degree D we just need to ensure that D *

417
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:15,080
n is much much much smaller than

418
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,440
F which governs I I put here the which

419
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,039
govern the

420
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,640
soundness okay so let's just see the

421
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,640
degree so here's a

422
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,960
claim the

423
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:36,159
degree of

424
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,159
flda is a most or let me write it

425
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:43,039
differently the sum let's look at the

426
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,960
degree for each variable okay the sum of

427
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,640
the

428
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,640
degree I for variable I of

429
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,880
Fe so we have n variables X1 of to xn

430
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,760
each one has some

431
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,039
degree the sum of these degrees I'm

432
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:05,280
going to argue is a most

433
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:05,280
s s being the number of

434
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,799
uh S

435
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:17,880
size of Fe which is defined to be this

436
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:17,880
is by definition the number of

437
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,400
leaves in

438
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:28,640
Fe okay so let me argue that the size is

439
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:34,400
um

440
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,400
is the most uh Fe is the the degrees the

441
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,440
most the Su of degrees the most s or the

442
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,720
size

443
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,000
okay by the way before actually I do

444
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,640
that just to make sure because I

445
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,559
actually noticed that I lost over too

446
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,640
quickly I said that you know this is all

447
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:54,159
we need to prove but I just want to make

448
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,840
sure is it clear that

449
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,559
flda and 01 to the

450
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,559
N is actually equals to

451
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:02,960
fee yeah that's very important because

452
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,480
we want to make sure that we're actually

453
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,000
summing over the actual fee like in 01

454
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,520
because we want to

455
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,760
prove uh sharp set of the fee formula

456
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,080
right and the reason is as we said is

457
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,400
that on

458
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,240
01 we really behave like the and and or

459
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,480
so of course outside of 01 who knows

460
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,400
we're over a Big Field who knows what's

461
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,120
going on but on Z1 we behave exactly

462
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,080
like the end and or like the original TR

463
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,880
therefore this this Ari arithmetic

464
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,720
formula is actually equal to the

465
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,400
original formula and 0 one to the

466
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,120
end yeah okay so good so this is what we

467
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,480
want to prove now let's just look at the

468
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,039
degree

469
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,000
yeah good good good this just means this

470
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:50,799
is the

471
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:54,120
degree of x i in Fe so I'm just going to

472
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:56,760
so so yeah or in other words I'm I can

473
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,760
argue that each variable has the real

474
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,600
most s but I can argue something strong

475
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,400
the sum of the degrees of all the

476
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,840
variables that most s okay know that s

477
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,000
is polinomial here okay we have this

478
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,640
that's the input the input is the h a

479
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,600
sad formula it's polinomial so as long

480
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,200
as this is the degree you know we're

481
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,720
happy the communication complexity the

482
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,080
verify complexity is going to be n the

483
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,720
number of variables D which is like s

484
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,760
polinomial uh and pol in the field so

485
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,960
it's po so the verifier is going to be

486
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,000
polinomial okay now we care about you

487
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,520
know now there's a notion of binomial

488
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,640
time verifier okay but if the degrees

489
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:39,240
are most s s is bomal we're

490
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:42,000
good okay so why why is this the degree

491
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,640
so to prove that this is the degree the

492
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,640
proof of this

493
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,400
claim is by

494
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,000
induction it's actually a pretty

495
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,039
straightforward proof and it really uses

496
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,039
the fact that fee is a Formula that the

497
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,039
original fee is a the formula

498
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,200
um so let's

499
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,120
see

500
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,000
so so the prove is just by

501
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:24,480
induction and here's how Okay so uh

502
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:28,919
we're going to prove by induction on the

503
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:32,880
on the depth of this uh formula and

504
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:35,480
and so okay if we have just one

505
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,320
gate then okay it's clear the degree is

506
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:41,320
just one uh so that's

507
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,320
fine

508
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,039
so if number of Gates or the depth if

509
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:52,159
you want is

510
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:53,760
one then of course the it's the degree

511
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,520
is going to be less than the size is

512
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,120
degree is just one that's if you just

513
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,200
have a single

514
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,960
gate uh and now if you have more General

515
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,279
so now suppose you have a circuit of the

516
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,840
form let's say add or malt it doesn't

517
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:13,039
matter or and you can have like F1

518
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:15,919
suppos Fe is F1 and or or I don't care

519
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,480
F2 okay this can gener the end but of

520
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:22,640
course it could be also an

521
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,640
or then how do we arithmetization

522
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:33,080
[Music]

523
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:36,159
F1 tlda times F2

524
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,399
tlda or in the case of this is for end

525
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:44,720
if for or if it was

526
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:46,600
or then it would be F1 TAA plus

527
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,440
f2a

528
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,520
minus1

529
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,120
time2 right all of course over X1 of X

530
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,120
over X1 of

531
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:03,440
X yeah okay so let's at I want argue

532
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:05,200
that the arithmetic version is of the

533
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:09,000
sum of the degrees of all the variables

534
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:12,480
that most s so let's see let's look at

535
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,520
flda if F Tilda was if the original Fe

536
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:20,799
was end of F1 and

537
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,679
F2 then flda is just the multiplication

538
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:26,320
by definition we replac and with

539
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:29,279
multiplication of the F1 tlda polinomial

540
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,080
times F2 2 ta polinomial

541
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:35,880
but what do we know here here the degree

542
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,799
of each the so now let's suppose okay

543
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,000
suppose F1 let's say it's of

544
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:47,080
size

545
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,080
S1 and suppose F2 is of size

546
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:55,200
S2 okay just now what we we know that

547
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,760
the sze of Cs is equal to S1 + S2

548
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,880
because it's a tree so there's no kind

549
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,039
of uh everything is open so the left

550
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,919
side of the tree is S1 size of S1 the

551
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,919
right side of the tree is size S2 the

552
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,440
entire tree is the size s which is S1

553
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,880
plus

554
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:16,480
S2 so now what is the a so what can we

555
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,559
say in this case so let's let's focus on

556
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,120
the on the and the or is exactly the

557
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:26,000
same so what can we say about about the

558
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:29,440
sum of the degrees so sum of

559
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,799
degree the the degree of the I ele of of

560
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:37,679
x i in

561
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:40,679
Fe is equal sumon I what is the degree

562
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,480
of the the I variable in Fe it's the

563
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:45,159
degree here plus the degree here when

564
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,279
you multiply things I need to some the

565
00:27:45,159 --> 00:27:55,399
degrees so it's the

566
00:27:48,279 --> 00:28:00,120
degree of x i in T1 tlda plus the

567
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:00,120
degree of variable I in C2

568
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:08,960
right when have two polom multiply the

569
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:08,960
degree adds but this is

570
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,720
just S1 + S2 by

571
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,760
induction by the induction

572
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:32,320
hypothesis okay so the the degree here

573
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,720
the sum of the degrees is like the size

574
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,840
of the formulas we actually don't really

575
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,159
care about the sum we care about the

576
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,720
degree itself but this kind of shows you

577
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:42,000
at least the degree of H one is also

578
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,960
most the size of the formula and

579
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,159
therefore the Su so now when we run so

580
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,080
let me put this back up so we run the

581
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:55,200
sum

582
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,760
check on this polinomial and we

583
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,120
get

584
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:04,600
the the communication complexity and the

585
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:07,279
verify run time will be n or the number

586
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,559
the number of variables here n times the

587
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,320
degree which is s essentially the size

588
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:15,519
of the input right that's s and polog

589
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:19,519
the field okay so you just need to take

590
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:21,440
and similarly uh and the verify yeah the

591
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,480
degree which is s the completeness is

592
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,440
always one and the soundness importantly

593
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,440
the soundness of this protocol

594
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:37,720
is n the number of variables the degree

595
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:41,039
which is s divided by the size of f so

596
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,039
all we need to make sure is to

597
00:29:51,399 --> 00:30:00,039
arithmetick ER those you

598
00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:00,039
want okay any yeah

599
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,880
questions

600
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:15,080
yeah you can go okay so when you do the

601
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:17,039
sum check like when the sum is happening

602
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,799
is that like necessarily a sum over the

603
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,360
field or can it be like any sum over

604
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,279
like a different field like if you're

605
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,320
like original field is just like I don't

606
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,000
know some field so okay just note in

607
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,200
this specific problem I don't have a

608
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,240
origal fi actually that for this

609
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,600
specific sharp set I'm over 01 there's

610
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,559
no field it's not an algebraic it's a

611
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,480
Boolean thing it I don't have any any

612
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:41,760
polinomial any algebra any field nothing

613
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:46,200
I just have zero one and I have and and

614
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,559
or Gates and to prove that to prove that

615
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,679
you know the number of satisfying

616
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:54,519
assignment in the Boolean cube is K I

617
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:57,519
choose a field of my liking and I

618
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,519
arithmetization

619
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,120
omals as as having additional

620
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,399
multiplication Gates and I think in my

621
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,039
head I think of this circuit as this

622
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:11,279
formula as a polinomial so I choose the

623
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,799
field it's not part it's not actually

624
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,799
the problem I I I am purpose kind of

625
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,600
chose a field so that I can do the Su

626
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,279
check

627
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,240
protocol right yeah um but I guess like

628
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:24,960
what I'm asking is like when you like

629
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,880
for the sum in the sum check like like

630
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,120
let's say you like not for this problem

631
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,440
oh I see I see you're saying you're

632
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,840
saying look let's say you have a some

633
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,600
check problem someone give you some

634
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,799
check problem and you're not happy with

635
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,120
the field the field is not good enough

636
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:38,279
for you or it doesn't give you enough

637
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,080
soundness can you can you amplify can

638
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:41,559
you work over a different field is that

639
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,159
what you're asking or I guess what I'm

640
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:46,039
asking is like if you have some check

641
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,799
and like there is some field like let's

642
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:50,039
say you're working mod like some large

643
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:51,559
prime or something good but then like

644
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:54,559
the S like will the sum that you're

645
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:58,320
doing be like also over that field

646
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:00,000
necessarily like can you okay so so when

647
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,720
I do a S check over the field everything

648
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,679
will be over that field yes everything

649
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,639
will be over the field however that said

650
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,360
if I'm not happy the P if you're saying

651
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:12,559
so I got a s Che protocol with certain p

652
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,279
over you know over gf2 a gfp with is so

653
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,799
everything is mod P with certain P now

654
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,080
yes everything should be over this field

655
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,519
now you can say well this p is not that

656
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,279
great because it's not that much bigger

657
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:24,760
than n * D and I'm not really happy with

658
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:26,240
this field or maybe even it's smaller

659
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,159
than n times B for all I know it's not a

660
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,240
good field not big enough then what do I

661
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:33,159
do so I'm saying it's okay don't worry

662
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:36,120
just take an extension field instead of

663
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:38,880
working over P you can you work over

664
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,559
kind of gfp to the N so you can take a

665
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,240
field of science P to the N for any end

666
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:45,919
that you want like and you're only going

667
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:49,080
to pay kind of polom or linearly with

668
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,039
this n so uh and then you can amplify

669
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,159
your sounds okay I was just wondering

670
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,840
because I was wondering what like what

671
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,880
happens if the K is like larger than the

672
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,559
size of field oh I'm going to choose the

673
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,760
field could be much Bigg okay okay I see

674
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,880
yeah I'm going to choose the field

675
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,320
otherwise you can't yeah I I'll need to

676
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,960
choose the field to be much bigger than

677
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:09,600
okay yeah so like oh sorry I I forgot

678
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,840
you okay yeah um this is kind of Rel

679
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,120
point but we need to choose a field that

680
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,559
have like really big characteristics and

681
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,080
we need to like choose a really big

682
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,320
prime number we can't just do like we

683
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,350
can't just it to the end oh because K

684
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,800
can be like two to the end

685
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,800
[Music]

686
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,200
that's bigger

687
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:35,480
than yeah no but the question is can you

688
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:39,120
no but the question a

689
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,480
well okay if okay in our case you can

690
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,720
just choose the field to be as big as

691
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,080
you want in in the case where you're

692
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,480
giving a su check of course K of course

693
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,240
the sum is in the field it's it's

694
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,600
something about the field you're giving

695
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,600
you're giving something about the field

696
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,639
so K will always would be in the field

697
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,880
but for the sharp for this specific one

698
00:33:54,639 --> 00:34:00,320
I'm thinking of yeah you choose a k

699
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,360
that's bigger however I'm not 100% sure

700
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,080
that let me

701
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:08,040
think can you use small

702
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,040
characteristic can you Chinese yeah

703
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,560
that's what I'm think I'm not sure if

704
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,079
you can't use some Chinese remainder

705
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,839
trick and use over a small

706
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,839
characteristic I need to think about it

707
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,800
but anyway in this case just choose a

708
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:22,240
after the gfp for a large p and that's

709
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,399
bigger than K yeah sorry did you have a

710
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,520
question oh ask is this the only know

711
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:28,520
how to

712
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,040
this is easy what do you mean you want

713
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,599
easier I so no I think I think this is

714
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:42,720
the simplest way so let me say let me

715
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:45,560
just say so you know we put H sharp set

716
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,639
into IP in this way you can ask what

717
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,960
about let's say sharp circuits at which

718
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,919
is the same thing but we're giving a

719
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,520
circuit so we're given a circuit and you

720
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:54,399
want to know how many satisfying

721
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,399
assignment does it have over zero1 to 10

722
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,680
it's the same thing except for fee is

723
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:02,800
now uh it's not a tree anymore it's a

724
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,599
directed as graph so uh and it turns out

725
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,560
that it also has an IP because it's in P

726
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:09,760
space you can go over all possible X's

727
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,560
X1 up to xn and check if it's satisfying

728
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,000
or not in it's small space so it's in P

729
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,000
space and so you can ask okay so what

730
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,880
about this now you can't do some check

731
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,480
because the degree won't be small so

732
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,640
actually you can do it but that's much

733
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,040
much more complicated and requires this

734
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,000
kind of degree reduction thing that's

735
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,960
kind of how sham proves IP equals speed

736
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,280
space it's the some degree reduction

737
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,119
there that really complicates matters so

738
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,800
you need that for a circuit set but for

739
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,320
set because it's so low degree

740
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,079
immediately kind of it's kind of nice

741
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,920
and that's all you do uh yeah you should

742
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,800
be where's the

743
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,599
Gratitude I guess re interpretation of

744
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,400
problem question suppose is you know

745
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:50,839
suppose you're given another problem say

746
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,119
permanent or something right so I want

747
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:55,560
to I guess not formally defined but I

748
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,599
want to direct kind of without reducing

749
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:02,079
to kind of uh you know like so for I

750
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:05,200
mean I want a direct uh protocol it's

751
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,160
not very well defined yeah so I have to

752
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,800
say almost all the protocols I know for

753
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,800
IP go through

754
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,119
some they were trying to prove

755
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:40,560
okay so I'm not familiar with that but I

756
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,880
think the main ones go through uh uh

757
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,880
some

758
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Che what I remember is like it's sort of

759
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,400
like sun but they're also like looking

760
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,400
at

761
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:05,640
any any other questions about sharp set

762
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:07,400
yeah the someck protoc is like I believe

763
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,319
it's operating over a field like all the

764
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,960
summation

765
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:13,960
goes so does that mean that we to be

766
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,640
safe to make sure Ure correctness we

767
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,599
must sure that the field has

768
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:21,960
characteristic greater than the number

769
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:24,400
of satisfying Solutions yeah two to the

770
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:29,040
uh two the two to the end yes yes but

771
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:32,000
the verifier runs in time log in this

772
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,359
circuit so in the in the log in the s in

773
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,680
the size of the field yeah log in the

774
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:39,560
size of the field so the field can be to

775
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:44,079
the then yeah requirement you can't fig

776
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:47,040
small character yeah so I yeah okay I

777
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,440
would so the what we should do is take

778
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,280
take gfp large large field like large

779
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,160
characteristic I'm not sure you can take

780
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,280
small characteristic actually I need to

781
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,160
think about it because maybe some

782
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:59,440
Chinese remainder theorem can help you

783
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,440
oh but that

784
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,599
[Music]

785
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,040
what said we run this protocol over very

786
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,160
small primes make sure that the answers

787
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,160
are all the

788
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,960
number exactly exactly

789
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,760
you don't want to sometimes actually I'm

790
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,960
not so sure right because the

791
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,680
computational complexity is going to be

792
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,760
S of is probably going to be smaller

793
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,839
instead of log a big field size to the

794
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:45,359
power three or something right you have

795
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:45,359
sum of log small size fields to the

796
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:57,920
power okay so by the way just note about

797
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,560
the the pro runtime here of course it's

798
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,720
large because he needs to find the SAT I

799
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,599
mean what can you do he needs to at

800
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,400
least count the number of satisfying

801
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:07,319
assignments it takes two to them at

802
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:11,040
least right to find them and then okay

803
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:13,040
so so far we gave some examples so where

804
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,800
are we right we talked about IP we

805
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:19,319
showed the magical amazing Su Che

806
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,640
protocol and we showed how to use the Su

807
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:25,880
protocol to give an IP for interactive

808
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,440
proof for Sharp set in some sense maybe

809
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,680
you're not so blown away at this point

810
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,160
because actually Sharps aent like a

811
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,240
formula is really you can

812
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,880
arithmetization is not like wow we know

813
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,359
all know that and is like multiplication

814
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,280
and and and the and and or can be

815
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:41,800
written as like small arithmetic thing

816
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,640
so it's actually an arithmetic circuit

817
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,800
so it's it's it's it's actually gives

818
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,760
yourself a lgre pom so some since it

819
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,119
calls for a subject it is a subject like

820
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,800
without much change it's like already it

821
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:54,119
presents itself almost as a

822
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,760
sub so maybe you're not convinced of the

823
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,400
generality of of the Su and the next

824
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,560
thing I want to do is kind of show you

825
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,800
actually uh completely different thing

826
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,160
that doesn't seem to be at all low

827
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,160
degree or anything and try to to uh show

828
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,240
you how you can use the S Check and

829
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:15,520
actually this takes us a kind of a nice

830
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:18,200
uh way into the idea of uh of doubly

831
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,000
efficient proofs so so far when we

832
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,920
talked about interactive proofs our

833
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,920
Focus was the verifier is efficient he's

834
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,520
poal time the approver can be whatever

835
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,280
and indeed in the protocols both some

836
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,599
check and sharp s of course the pro runs

837
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,640
in exponential time he has no choice he

838
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,480
needs to do the

839
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,280
computation

840
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,520
okay the idea that so now let's kind of

841
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,200
shift gears and talk about the notion of

842
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,000
a double efficient

843
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,200
interactive so the notion of a double

844
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,200
efficient interactive proof the idea is

845
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,520
actually you know what you don't so the

846
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,480
main idea is we care about the run time

847
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,319
of the proof so the pro is not all

848
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,440
powerful it kind of brings us kind of to

849
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,839
real life okay it's very nice that the

850
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,000
verifier is for nor the Prov is all

851
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,800
powerful but guess what all powerful

852
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,800
doesn't exist everything is limited to

853
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,359
some extent there's more powerful and

854
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,839
less powerful but there's not all

855
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:10,119
powerful so what we want is yes the

856
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:11,480
prover is more powerful than the

857
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:13,280
verifier otherwise we don't need it the

858
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,920
verifier doesn't need him but even the

859
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,920
pro is not all powerful so in a doubly

860
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,880
efficient interactive Pro we want to say

861
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,560
the prover has a problem at hand and he

862
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,640
should not spend too much overhead in

863
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,680
convincing the verifier that the

864
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,480
solution is that he that his solution

865
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,079
that you know let's say that X is in the

866
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:39,160
language okay and and this is kind of

867
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:40,280
interesting even if the problem so when

868
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,440
we talk about doubly efficient

869
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,560
interractive proofs we even care of

870
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,160
problems in P so often when we talk

871
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,680
about contracted proof we think even

872
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,319
let's say the problem is polinomial

873
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:57,000
time so I have Al I I want to argue

874
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:59,000
prove some pomal time uh you know the a

875
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,359
link anguage but I want the verify let's

876
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,400
say the time to to determine this

877
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,440
language is I don't know n to the 4th I

878
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,560
want the verifier to be linear

879
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,280
time okay so the idea is I I there

880
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,000
should always be a gap between how

881
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,319
powerful the PO is and the verifier is

882
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,079
weaker but I really care about both I

883
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:18,880
care the verifier should be very very

884
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:21,280
efficient and the PO should not should

885
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,599
also be somewhat efficient okay that's

886
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,559
the idea so okay so what is a doubly

887
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:28,559
efficient in trative proof

888
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:40,280
so a dou let's say for for example l in

889
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,960
some D time T so can be computed in the

890
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,359
teristic time

891
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:49,319
T again you can think of T even to be n

892
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:53,800
the fourth okay can be polinomial

893
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:57,400
is is an IP

894
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:01,440
where the Pro run time the honest Pro

895
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,440
the honest provers

896
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,960
runtime is

897
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,119
only polinomial overhead in the time of

898
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,640
determining the language okay so it

899
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:13,319
takes time T to determine here is the

900
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:17,640
time of most

901
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:17,640
Po and the verifier on

902
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:26,280
time should be much much less see

903
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,960
ideally we want the verif to run in time

904
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,720
like

905
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,640
like almost linear or quasi linear we so

906
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,680
n poly log n let's say which is denoted

907
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,040
by

908
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:40,000
O Okay so ideally want the verify TR in

909
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,640
linear time or quasi linear

910
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,720
time and the P should not have too much

911
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,119
overhead actually IDE po should also

912
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,280
have just linear

913
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:49,559
overhead okay but definitely by

914
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,079
definition it should not have more than

915
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:52,079
pomal

916
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,800
overhead and and sorry yes yes thank you

917
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,119
and this is T n is the instance size yes

918
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,839
so of course the verify needs to read

919
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:06,839
the instance but not do much more than

920
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:08,319
that okay so it's just interactive proof

921
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:14,119
we care about both the pro and the

922
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:15,960
verifier okay and uh yeah and and so let

923
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,119
me mention that these like things that

924
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,960
people actually care about because they

925
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,240
use it in these blockchain protocols and

926
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,079
so on and so they really actually a lot

927
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:25,599
of work that's done on this and I think

928
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:27,119
in the lecture notes of Justin Taylor

929
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,960
I'm not going to refer to these sections

930
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,920
we won't cover them but they the exist

931
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,599
sections where he really talks about the

932
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,599
exact kind of parameters the exact

933
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:35,760
numbers the exact implementations and so

934
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:37,240
on so forth because this these are

935
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,920
things that actually people care about

936
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,240
because they want to run it so actually

937
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,800
we really care about you know the

938
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,640
overheads here in in practice case okay

939
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,319
so now so so far we said the Su check is

940
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,480
really it's this of course it's like it

941
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,880
seems like outside the realm even of

942
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,319
double double double efficiency but

943
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:59,359
actually now let me show you a specific

944
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,720
example which again we is beyond just an

945
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:04,839
example because we'll teach use it to

946
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:07,559
teach something uh where it's actually

947
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:11,359
in p and I I'll show you an interactive

948
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:13,359
proof for for this problem okay uh using

949
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:15,240
the suck protocol a dou efficient

950
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:19,760
interractive proof of this problem

951
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:22,400
yeah like t d good yeah yeah yeah so

952
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,119
take any problem any language for which

953
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,119
membership in this language can be

954
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:28,920
decided in time to okay so D I'm there's

955
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,119
a deterministic algorithm that runs in

956
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:34,040
time T what T is it can be anything you

957
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:38,040
can think of t n to the 4th n to the

958
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:40,720
10th I don't know uh ENT to the log n uh

959
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:43,319
quazi po whatever all I care so of

960
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,440
course the PO needs to needs to compute

961
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:45,880
if he's proving something he needs to

962
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,760
know that it's true so he needs to do

963
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,760
this determin of computation so of

964
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,319
course he needs to run in time te but

965
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,599
should not run in much more than T and

966
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:58,800
by not more theorists say poly T applied

967
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:02,640
people say linear in t the real appli

968
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,079
you know say not more than 128 whatever

969
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:11,680
but um yeah depending how far you are in

970
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:14,440
that Spectrum um okay so a good so now

971
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:17,400
let me show you how a doubly efficient

972
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:20,200
interractive proof for counting the

973
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,240
number of triangles in a graph okay

974
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,319
that's the

975
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,000
example next week I'm going to show you

976
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:27,480
actually interactive proof for all for

977
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,280
dou interactive proof for all low depth

978
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:33,440
circuits so I'm going to generalize it

979
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,440
by a lot but let's start with like an

980
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:42,960
example okay

981
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:45,480
so let's say we're given a graph G and

982
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,920
we want to count the number of triangles

983
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:53,559
in the graph okay so given

984
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,559
G so we want to interactive proof for

985
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,839
counting number of

986
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:10,240
triangles in a graph

987
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:12,000
G with vertices V and edges e okay so

988
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,000
okay I want to cast it as a doubly

989
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,599
efficient sum Che protocol kind of sub

990
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,079
protocol but so notice this this is a

991
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:21,440
problem in P I can go over all possible

992
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:23,800
three vertices triple to

993
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,480
vertices and check if there's a triangle

994
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:28,160
so I can I can check this problem time

995
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,640
ENT to the

996
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,880
third I want that my verifier to be

997
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:36,520
linear so I want to Pro the runs in time

998
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,480
not much more than ENT the third uh or

999
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:42,880
let's say polinomial time to convince a

1000
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:46,640
linear verifier that this graph has a mo

1001
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,640
has let's exactly K

1002
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:53,040
triangles and I want to cast it somehow

1003
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:55,599
in the subject protocol so how do I do

1004
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:57,839
that so I first I need to come up with a

1005
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,440
polinomial right I that's kind of I need

1006
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:02,680
to embed a polom here no there's nothing

1007
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:06,319
polinomial like here talking about

1008
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,800
graphs okay so remember how origin I

1009
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,480
told you everything is a polinomial

1010
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,880
everything can become a polinomial this

1011
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,400
is an example that kind of shows you why

1012
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,200
you take anything and make it a

1013
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,240
polinomial so what is the idea let's

1014
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,680
look at the

1015
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,520
adjacency uh Matrix corresponding to

1016
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,359
this graph okay that checks if there's

1017
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:27,319
an edge between pair of

1018
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,559
vertices now we can write this Matrix as

1019
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:31,720
a function

1020
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,839
f that goes from let's say V like number

1021
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,079
of vertices times number of vertices to

1022
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:38,400
01 takes a pair of vertices I'll put

1023
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:41,160
zero if there's no Edge one if there's

1024
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,640
an edge let's denote the number of

1025
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:47,480
vertices here by n so sorry I denoted

1026
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,599
there the input length by n close enough

1027
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,400
it's not really the input length the

1028
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:53,480
number of vertices but it's denoted by n

1029
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,400
okay so now we can think of the

1030
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:59,520
adjacency Matrix as a function so think

1031
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,520
of the adjacency

1032
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:09,880
Matrix let me write it as a function

1033
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:12,760
f that goes from 01 to the log n I'm

1034
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:15,359
going to assume that N is a power of two

1035
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:18,000
goes from so it takes a I'm going to

1036
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:22,119
think of a Vertex so v as I said is of

1037
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:24,480
size n write it here so won't be in my

1038
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:29,440
way I'm going to think of the function

1039
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,440
as taking a pair of vertices where

1040
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:37,240
I I represent a Vertex as a vector in 01

1041
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,920
to the log n okay any number of n like

1042
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,799
binary representation of the I think of

1043
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,960
the vertices it's numbers between one

1044
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:46,200
and N I'm thinking of the binary

1045
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,680
representation and I output 0 one

1046
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,799
whether there's an edge or whether

1047
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,920
there's no Edge between this vertices

1048
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:54,599
these two

1049
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:58,640
vertices okay so this says one if and

1050
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:58,640
only if there exists an edge

1051
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,520
between the two

1052
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,160
vertices okay now suppose you want to

1053
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:10,559
argue that the number of triangles is

1054
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,559
let's say

1055
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:20,160
k so what do you need to prove you need

1056
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:24,200
to prove that the sum over all i j and k

1057
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:27,079
in N or let me even make myself in 0 one

1058
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:29,240
to the log in to make it easy for myself

1059
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:32,680
because I'm representing in binary so

1060
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:34,680
for any three

1061
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:37,000
vertices let's count the number of

1062
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:39,280
triangle so when when is there's a

1063
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:44,200
triangle

1064
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:49,359
if I and J are connected this is one and

1065
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:51,160
fjk is connected this is one and f i is

1066
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:53,640
connected this is

1067
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:56,799
one they all need to be connected in

1068
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:59,599
order for it to be a triangle

1069
00:50:56,799 --> 00:51:01,640
okay so now not if if they're now I get

1070
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,160
so if it's a triangle I get one if it's

1071
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,480
not a triangle I get zero because one of

1072
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:08,200
them is going to be a zero so I want to

1073
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,200
count the number of

1074
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,760
triangles and I want to prove check that

1075
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,200
this is

1076
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:19,240
K almost almost I lied a little

1077
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:22,480
bit I kind of overcounted because

1078
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:24,839
there's permutation igk jki so I need to

1079
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,839
divide by one over six is the number of

1080
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:29,760
way to permute any JK any I JK is

1081
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,920
counted like all

1082
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:36,040
permutations so this is what I want to

1083
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:40,920
prove okay I want to prove that the

1084
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:43,280
sum of all possible triangles i j k i

1085
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,640
kind I counted each I JK here

1086
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,240
essentially six times so I need to

1087
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,040
divide by one over

1088
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:51,400
six the number of the sum the number of

1089
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:55,240
triangles is

1090
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,680
K okay almost at least I have sum it's

1091
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,480
getting to look like a su check but

1092
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,920
there's no algeb there's no Algebra I

1093
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,920
just wrote in numbers I mean I took

1094
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:08,160
binary representation but at least you

1095
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:11,359
know I have uh I I have some sum so if

1096
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:14,319
if I had some Al nice algebra here if

1097
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:17,319
this was all over a finite field and

1098
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:20,480
let's say this F was also low degree

1099
00:52:17,319 --> 00:52:23,079
then I can use some check okay so again

1100
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,680
suppose this was over a finite field and

1101
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:26,000
suppose this F was very low degreee and

1102
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,359
the field was large we have good

1103
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,640
soundness

1104
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:36,079
I want to prove sum of this big

1105
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:36,079
F is K

1106
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:44,520
Sun so I just need to kind of tell you

1107
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:46,760
how how do I get uh how do I add

1108
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:49,680
algebra where do you know to make this

1109
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:52,079
degree low degree and and uh where did

1110
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,799
the finite field come from and so on

1111
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:57,680
I'll do that but before I'll do that

1112
00:52:53,799 --> 00:53:04,040
also note there some here

1113
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:06,480
is only over 01 to the 3 log n right so

1114
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:10,319
it's actually remember the problem was

1115
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:14,160
the Pro run time is very large it's h to

1116
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:17,440
the m times the time it takes to to

1117
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:20,119
compute one function and times this m

1118
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,839
this m is going to be is small but the H

1119
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:26,920
to m is the problem but here H to the m

1120
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:30,160
is just two to the 3 log n 2 the l n so

1121
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:33,000
it's prob so if I'm able to put like a

1122
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:35,040
some check like a algebra here the I I

1123
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
will get double the pro will still be

1124
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:40,200
pomal time which is what I

1125
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,319
want okay I just the question is how do

1126
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,319
I put algebra

1127
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,599
here okay so this is

1128
00:53:54,119 --> 00:53:58,400
where so I'll say a little bit about

1129
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,319
this this and then we'll break for today

1130
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,960
and continue next

1131
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:08,119
week but the way there's a generic way

1132
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:11,640
to convert any function into a into a

1133
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:15,480
polinomial okay and the the way to do it

1134
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,480
is via technique called Low degree

1135
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:29,440
extension so

1136
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:32,040
if you actually remember the way we

1137
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:33,240
start I started class with an example of

1138
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,440
the matrix

1139
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,520
multiplication and if you remember in

1140
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,319
the matrix multiplication there also

1141
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,520
there's no polinomial it's a matrix you

1142
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:44,359
know nothing but what we did the

1143
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:47,960
randomized algorithm that we showed we

1144
00:54:44,359 --> 00:54:49,920
thought of a row in The Matrix as a

1145
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,760
polinomial so we took a row which

1146
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:55,960
consists of n elements and we thought

1147
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,920
about it as a univariate polinomial of

1148
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:00,160
degree

1149
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:02,240
n remember we thought of like the row as

1150
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,760
like coefficients of the polinomial so

1151
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,160
we thought it was a polinomial of degree

1152
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,119
of degree n minus one I guess n elements

1153
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,839
one is the free coefficient so degree n

1154
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:14,640
minus one so we started already the

1155
00:55:10,839 --> 00:55:16,839
class with an example that I have a row

1156
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:19,920
nothing no algebra nothing arbory row of

1157
00:55:16,839 --> 00:55:23,079
Matrix and we converted it to a univ

1158
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,280
poomi of degree n like the length of the

1159
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:28,160
M of the

1160
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:31,480
row what we do here is a very similar

1161
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:34,039
idea but in the multivariant setting

1162
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:38,039
okay so what we can do we can take we

1163
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:42,039
could have taken any n element that Row

1164
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:45,240
for example or in this case like the

1165
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:48,760
elements are all the kind

1166
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:50,799
of for any F any F you can think of it

1167
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,760
it's like a matrix right it's like N

1168
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:55,200
squared elements if you want for any two

1169
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,920
elements whether there's a a edge or not

1170
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,280
an edge so you can think of N squared

1171
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:02,079
elements doesn't matter we can take any

1172
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:05,559
set of

1173
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:07,520
elements and convert it either to a UNIF

1174
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:10,359
polinomial as we did before of that

1175
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,440
degree or that's not good for us because

1176
00:56:10,359 --> 00:56:13,640
here's the degree is going to be N

1177
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,480
squared it's already like the verifier

1178
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,039
runs in the degree and more it's not

1179
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,599
going to be efficient enough but the

1180
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:23,359
idea is we can convert it to a multivari

1181
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:25,599
polinomial with much much smaller

1182
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:27,920
degree okay and that's what's called the

1183
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:32,000
multi the low degree extension so

1184
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,720
whereas before we just did a univariant

1185
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:38,079
polinomial so we had to kind of put the

1186
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,359
co the the N elements kind of as

1187
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:43,000
coefficients each one kind of added a

1188
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:44,799
degree if you will if we put it in a

1189
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,880
multivariate

1190
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:52,200
polinomial so if we think of it like as

1191
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:55,839
a polinomial over let's say h to the m

1192
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:58,079
then we can stack inside H to the m we

1193
00:56:55,839 --> 00:57:01,599
can stack attack n points we can make H

1194
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:04,400
and N much each H and both H and N to be

1195
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,799
much much smaller than and that kind of

1196
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,559
what we're going to do so let me let me

1197
00:57:05,799 --> 00:57:11,680
explain this uh uh more more

1198
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:14,680
precisely

1199
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,680
um

1200
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:27,559
okay okay so here here's the theorem

1201
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:29,960
we're going to use for for this

1202
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:33,799
so take

1203
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:38,319
any for any function non polinomial can

1204
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:42,200
be arbitrary like the adjacency Matrix

1205
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:45,000
function for any function f there it's

1206
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:49,160
like from 01 to the 2 log n but let me

1207
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:50,799
take it more generally from H to the m

1208
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:54,920
to

1209
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:56,839
01 again in this example H is just 01

1210
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,520
and M is like two long n because we have

1211
00:57:56,839 --> 00:58:00,119
there two log n but let me give you

1212
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:03,039
something more generally so take any

1213
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:06,039
function okay this is essentially any

1214
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:07,920
set you can think of this this is

1215
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:10,960
any

1216
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,880
set of this or this is kind of

1217
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:17,480
equivalent to any

1218
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:21,359
element and 01 to the H to the

1219
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:24,079
m right so it's just a string of Len of

1220
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:26,799
binary string of length H to n so take

1221
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:29,760
any binary string of length H to to the

1222
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:32,880
m okay just tells you for each element

1223
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:39,520
into the M what the value is z or

1224
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:39,520
one so for any function and any finite

1225
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:47,200
field F that contains

1226
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:56,799
h of course in that example 01 F

1227
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,799
contains any

1228
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:00,960
and any F contains zero and one so

1229
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:03,200
that's not a

1230
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:06,480
problem there

1231
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,480
exists a

1232
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,799
unique what's called Low degree

1233
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:19,960
extension I'll explain what this means

1234
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:26,200
in a second it's a function f

1235
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:28,119
Tilda from F to the N to f

1236
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:31,440
such that so in what sense is it low

1237
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:35,920
degree extension first it's an

1238
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:38,920
extension namely F Tilla if you look at

1239
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,599
an an H to the N for the element in the

1240
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:46,640
little Cube it's exactly

1241
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:51,280
F so it extends it extends f f was an H

1242
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:54,599
to the m f till up is an a bigger uh

1243
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:57,839
Cube it extends on the small cube they

1244
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:59,720
agree the second second thing is that

1245
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:02,280
it's low degree so it's a low degree

1246
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:06,720
extension extension and a low degree

1247
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:10,359
what how low so uh

1248
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,359
flda is of

1249
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,640
degree hus one in each

1250
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,680
variable okay so again

1251
01:00:26,119 --> 01:00:31,920
what is the theorem the theorem is you

1252
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:35,119
can take any set if you want you can

1253
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:39,440
take any set so let's say of n numbers

1254
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:41,640
take any fix so take any set let's say

1255
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:44,720
fix any

1256
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:48,760
uh any

1257
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:50,880
Vector let's say w and let's say 01 to

1258
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,880
the

1259
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:57,920
N you can always embed it you can think

1260
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,920
of w

1261
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:04,240
an equivalent way to think of w oh sorry

1262
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:06,880
I didn't mean I meant to say sorry as a

1263
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:10,880
let's say W1 up to w

1264
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,880
n in 01 to the

1265
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:17,920
N you can embed it you can think of it

1266
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:17,920
as a as a

1267
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:27,039
function from H to the N to 01 as long

1268
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:29,960
as H to the m is n so you can you have a

1269
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:34,400
long sequence of zero ones fold it into

1270
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:34,400
a nice kind of uh you know

1271
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:41,240
a cube of size H to them so essentially

1272
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:45,400
should think of the H

1273
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:49,160
representation of of n okay the H

1274
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:52,720
representation so you just kind of H to

1275
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:54,480
the m is equivalent to the set you can

1276
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,319
think of a projection between that and

1277
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,079
the all the numbers between 0 one

1278
01:01:56,319 --> 01:02:01,079
between one up to

1279
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:04,440
n and now the claim is actually you can

1280
01:02:01,079 --> 01:02:08,640
take this St so this is let's say h by m

1281
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,640
you can kind of extend it to a bigger

1282
01:02:08,839 --> 01:02:16,440
function

1283
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:21,520
Tilda over F this is over F to the

1284
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:23,200
m such that it has degree H minus one in

1285
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:26,240
each

1286
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:30,960
variable so just note if we think of of

1287
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:34,359
M as being one the univariant

1288
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:38,200
case is exactly what we had before if

1289
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:42,119
you had just a string of like size of

1290
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:47,400
size uh if n is one H essentially is

1291
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:49,960
like n okay I take n i just just expand

1292
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:52,839
it in this way to a degree

1293
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:54,680
n but then the degree is very large

1294
01:02:52,839 --> 01:02:56,880
that's not good like the verifier runs

1295
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:59,559
in time the degree that's all

1296
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,200
so I make the degree much smaller how do

1297
01:02:59,559 --> 01:03:02,000
I make the degree much smaller I add

1298
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:04,599
more

1299
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:09,880
variables so the idea

1300
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:12,599
is ADD many more variables now in each

1301
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:15,440
Dimension the degree is only

1302
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:18,200
H because now I don't need the size of H

1303
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:22,240
is n but H to the N is

1304
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:26,079
n and now in each Dimension the the

1305
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:29,839
number of elements is like H so and the

1306
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:32,640
Anita mention the degree will be H minus

1307
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:34,520
one instead of n minus one like it was

1308
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:36,839
in the univariant

1309
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:39,119
case I'll prove all this but this is

1310
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:41,079
just kind of a high level idea okay so

1311
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:43,000
again the high level idea we'll go into

1312
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:45,920
the proof next time of the theorem but

1313
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:48,799
the high level idea is we all know by

1314
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:51,839
the kind of the the univarate case that

1315
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:55,799
you can take any string of length n and

1316
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:57,960
coded as a univer function of degree n

1317
01:03:55,799 --> 01:04:00,760
minus one by there's two ways of doing

1318
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:02,799
it either by thinking of the string as

1319
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:05,359
the coefficients that's one element one

1320
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:07,839
way to do it and another way to do it

1321
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:12,119
which is how the load extension works is

1322
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:15,359
by thinking of the string as the value

1323
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:17,720
of the polom in let's say polinomial

1324
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:22,000
value on one two three up to n let's say

1325
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:22,000
one up to n is in the field so think of

1326
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:30,599
gfp here what we do we take your

1327
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:33,079
points we take a polinomial f for which

1328
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:35,960
your points are sitting in this small

1329
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:40,200
cube so let's say you have a vector of

1330
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:42,680
size one up to n we'll put here W1 W2 W3

1331
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:45,559
wh all the W's will put

1332
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:48,359
here and then the theorem says there's a

1333
01:04:45,559 --> 01:04:52,920
way to extend this entire thing into a

1334
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:56,720
bigger polom of degree H minus one in

1335
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:59,039
each in each uh variable

1336
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:01,000
such that that the if you look at the

1337
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:04,279
polom on this Cube it's exactly what we

1338
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:07,400
had before so you have your kind of uh

1339
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:10,839
vector or your you know your function

1340
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:13,319
from H to then to 01 here and the and

1341
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:15,319
the rest it's just extended and then

1342
01:05:13,319 --> 01:05:19,839
extended in a way that the degree of

1343
01:05:15,319 --> 01:05:24,760
each variable is H minus one okay so for

1344
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:28,240
example if if you want H to the m to be

1345
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,920
n would you can take for example is H to

1346
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:33,400
be log

1347
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:35,119
n the degree is only log which is great

1348
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,440
and you can take n to be even smaller

1349
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:37,599
than log if you do the math it's going

1350
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:41,119
to be log

1351
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:41,119
n over log

1352
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:47,880
log and note that the verifier runs in

1353
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:49,480
time that depends on M M H and D and D

1354
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,079
is going to be also H so all of it's

1355
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:53,160
going to be

1356
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:55,279
polyon which is

1357
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,760
great okay so next time what we're going

1358
01:05:55,279 --> 01:05:59,400
to do is is prove the slow degree

1359
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:02,079
extension theorem and then show how to

1360
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:03,720
use it uh first for the triangle that

1361
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:05,880
would be pretty immediate and then we'll

1362
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:09,119
show how to use it uh for kind of a

1363
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:12,440
general low degree low low depth circuit

1364
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:12,440
okay thanks
