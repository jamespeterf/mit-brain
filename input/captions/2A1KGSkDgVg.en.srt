1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,679
uh welcome everyone and thank you for

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,120
coming we have a great turnout today for

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:09,360
the first Rene Salazar speaker series

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,000
from the Bro Institute for January

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,879
2025 and the Rene Salazar speaker series

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,920
is from the latinx group and part of

7
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:19,279
Shades abroad so the latinx at Broad has

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,600
a mission of building Community among

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,439
latinx brodies and empowering members of

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,039
the latinx community and building a

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:31,359
community Network and allies for people

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:34,000
from Latin America and the Caribbean

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,600
so the r solar speaker series program

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,200
wants to highlight latinx and diverse

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,760
researchers within and outside the broad

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,360
Institute Foster collaboration allow

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,160
visibility and role models for diverse

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,960
individuals and opportunities to network

19
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,160
and promote their research as well as

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,760
highlighting members who are currently

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,559
on the job market or trying to um create

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,480
new areas of research or try and like

23
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:57,680
integrate into other countries or

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,000
promote their research in other

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,320
countries and Foster the collaboration

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,560
once again from these Avenues today's

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,200
speaker is Dr Julian MOA abalenda so Dr

28
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,759
Julian Mora abalenda was born in bota

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,360
Columbia his fascination with the world

30
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,400
around him led to the study of biology

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,680
and later biotechnology I feel that

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,640
integrates diverse areas such as

33
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,439
molecular biology agriculture Commerce

34
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,920
and intellectual property here in a

35
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,240
Bachelor of Science in biology and

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,720
recently completed his PhD in

37
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,040
biotechnology at University D Nas

38
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,640
Colombia in bota he's a member of the

39
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,280
research group in plan genetic

40
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,360
engineering for his institution and

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,960
additionally he holds a master's in

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,320
biotechnology and a master's degree in

43
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,640
Commerce from Macar

44
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,320
University Julian is also an amateur

45
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,600
nature photographer and collaborates on

46
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,000
Publications and artwork with his wife

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,119
he also has a personal passion for

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,119
culinary fermentation exploring it

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,280
purely for fun curiosity and his love

50
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,759
for food rather than for an academic

51
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,000
perspective so take it away Julian um

52
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,159
good afternoon everybody I would like to

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
thank you for the invitation for the

54
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,920
chance to be here sharing some of my

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,240
life and and my work and I would like to

56
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,520
thank forina and marar for making this

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,920
possible

58
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,640
and and I'm really pleased to to be here

59
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:18,040
and really really honored um I'm going

60
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,840
to talk mainly about um the work that we

61
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,879
do at the plan genetic engineering group

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,480
in in un National Colombia in

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,879
botam but I would also like to take the

64
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,879
chance to talk about the path that took

65
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:35,400
me there and sort of the experience of

66
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,120
working in this area of research and um

67
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,720
the career path that that I have

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,720
followed so in order to make the talk a

69
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,080
little bit more more personal and not

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,440
strictly technical

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,680
um seeing that people who attend this

72
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,239
these talks may be coming from different

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,959
areas of research and and could be more

74
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,560
interested in the personal aspect or in

75
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,640
the in the human aspect of of the career

76
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,280
path

77
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,040
and so I'm going to be talking about how

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,920
we we're trying to adapt and adopt

79
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:13,120
generic agricultural bi technology and

80
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,480
making it possible to to bring some of

81
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,200
this technology to to Colombian Farmers

82
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,200
to to the field and to the

83
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,640
consumer later on in this talk I will

84
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,040
be going deeper into what was my PhD

85
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,720
research and the research that the group

86
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,599
does but um I I'd like to start by

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,200
recognizing some of the people who who

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,560
have been together with me during this

89
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,640
path and that have been my mentors and

90
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,920
that have made it possible for me to to

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,720
grow as a professional and as a human

92
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:52,400
being and that uh sort of showed me a

93
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,319
path and helped awaken the interest the

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,560
academic interest U that have been with

95
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:02,879
me during different stages of my life uh

96
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,480
I I did um bachelor in sci biology in

97
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,239
University National Colombia in bot and

98
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,239
probably the first teacher that um that

99
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:16,000
awakened an interest a real academic

100
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,519
interest in me was professor eleno and

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,919
pis with whom we started the theoretical

102
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,080
biology group in in in the University um

103
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,320
it was a great group of students and and

104
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,080
Professor Andra where we we studied

105
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,840
evolution Ary biology from a theoretical

106
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,800
perspective we delved into the

107
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,039
philosophy and History of Science and he

108
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,440
opened our eyes to seeing biology as

109
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:47,320
more than uh a collection of species and

110
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,560
lab work uh but how it talk to other

111
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,199
disciplines like philosophy

112
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,840
thermodynamics physics uh seeing biology

113
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:59,120
as the interaction of complex systems

114
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,800
and um well it was really Awakening for

115
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,039
me to to be part of this and ever since

116
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,199
then I I feel that I have

117
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,759
a a view of biology that

118
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,520
integrate all these different aspects

119
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,160
that are not just Natural Sciences but

120
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,080
also human sciences and and seeing

121
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,400
biology as a whole body of knowledge

122
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,680
that interacts and talks to other

123
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:28,120
disciplines I did my my bachelor's

124
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
thesis research thesis in the genetics

125
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,319
Institute of the University team

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,360
supervised by Professor Jova

127
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:39,000
K and accompanied by by Rita

128
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,039
badri and that's where I I started

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,720
working with molecular biology and

130
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:47,080
learning some of the lab techniques that

131
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,840
that would be really helpful throughout

132
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,840
all my my

133
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,039
career I then several years after this I

134
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:00,520
I went to Australia to do my master's

135
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:05,160
degree in mcari University

136
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:08,840
there I met um Professor Paul Haynes who

137
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,039
was very strict but at the same time was

138
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,360
very passionate for for the work he he

139
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:18,319
he taught he taught proteomics at the

140
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,720
time and he really got the best out of

141
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,000
of his

142
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,240
students while I was doing that master's

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,919
degree which combined biotechnology and

144
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,800
commerce

145
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:34,039
and I I was able to to see how how well

146
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,319
coming from a relatively theoretical

147
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,960
background try to find

148
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:43,080
how the the knowledge in biology could

149
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:46,720
be applied and could be used uh

150
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,240
for for products to improve people's

151
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,360
life quality uh to see something coming

152
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,319
out of the lab coming out of University

153
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,479
and actually reaching reaching people I

154
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,360
did an internship at appli systems which

155
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,800
was a

156
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,840
startup from AAR University and the

157
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,400
supervision of Dr Junior

158
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,000
teal working with the development of a

159
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,560
fusion protein expression system in a

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,560
filamentous

161
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,120
fungus and well this University offered

162
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,400
this double degree in biotechnology and

163
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,520
commerce and and gave me the chance to

164
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,319
to actually work at a at a company while

165
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,520
I was still studying my my Master's

166
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,800
Degree seeing how there was this

167
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,080
communication between University and and

168
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,080
the

169
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,479
industry after the the Masters I came

170
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,759
back to Colombia with this vision of

171
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:39,039
actually applying this theoretical and

172
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,319
practical knowledge in biology H for the

173
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,000
development of of products I wanted to

174
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,879
see things happen and that's where I

175
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,800
talked to to Professor Alejandro chaparo

176
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,199
hiraldo who who was a teacher at the

177
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,199
department of biology University

178
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,000
National Colombia and he invited me to

179
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,120
join the plant genetic engineering group

180
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,960
um this was a long time before I started

181
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,960
my PhD I started collaborating with him

182
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,879
and then under his supervision I started

183
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,360
my

184
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,879
PhD

185
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,400
research Professor chaparro he had a

186
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,840
vision and the aim of the of the

187
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,080
research group uh has always been to

188
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,840
bring together uh different areas of

189
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,000
knowledge different disciplines H for in

190
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,560
order with a big aim of bringing crop

191
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,879
technology to the field and making it as

192
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,560
real as as it can get so not only being

193
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,880
strict from a research and a theoretical

194
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:39,320
perspective but um actually seeing the

195
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,080
products of biotechnology used by the by

196
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,890
the

197
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,720
agriculture producers and the and the

198
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,200
[Music]

199
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,080
consumers unfortunately Professor

200
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,640
chaparo died in

201
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:58,120
2020 but he left ER with a great

202
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,399
community of his students who still are

203
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,360
part of the research group and and and

204
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,000
are trying to continue with with this

205
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,800
Vision so he brought together H

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,399
knowledge in molecular biology tissue

207
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,279
culture and Agronomy he was an

208
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,160
agronomist integrating these fields as a

209
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,279
necessary elements for the development

210
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,480
of biotechnology in Colombia from a

211
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,480
public

212
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,000
university seeing what had been done in

213
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,800
Colombia and the work the group had done

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,360
until maybe 10 years ago maybe 12 years

215
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,959
ago and no no nationally developed

216
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,120
biotechnology product had reached the

217
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:41,079
field you know talking about crop biot

218
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:45,040
technology and part of this was due to

219
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:46,800
the difficulty of overcoming regulations

220
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,560
and the protection of several of these

221
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,839
products by intellectual uh

222
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,000
property things such as

223
00:09:52,839 --> 00:10:00,079
patents so the group also started

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,480
researching in the IP Pro uh

225
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:05,360
aspects of crop biotechnology making

226
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:10,480
this a central part of the research that

227
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,040
that was done and making it evident that

228
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,839
this was something that had to be taken

229
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,079
into account since the very beginning of

230
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,800
any research project if it was going to

231
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,480
reach the field if the seeds were going

232
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,200
to be planted in real life conditions

233
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,360
there were some experiences uh by other

234
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,920
researchers in the country where

235
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:33,320
products were developed that were proved

236
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,720
to work but never ER reached a producer

237
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,440
or a consumer

238
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,160
because the the IP restrictions did not

239
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,279
make it possible it was impossible to

240
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,839
license impossible to to

241
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,800
overcome so we started taking this into

242
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,680
account and and exploring which crops

243
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,200
and which traits could be implemented

244
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,200
through this through this um point of

245
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,200
view

246
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,680
so

247
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:06,519
biotechnological crops have been around

248
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:10,200
have been in the market for more than 25

249
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:13,200
years close to 30 years now um and they

250
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,360
have always been surrounded by a

251
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,680
different kinds of protection such as

252
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:22,680
patent plant variety protection material

253
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,040
transfer agreements Etc and for the

254
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,600
development of a of a biotechnological

255
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,959
crop a genetically modified crop there

256
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,920
are lots of aspects that can be

257
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,480
protected by by patterns for example

258
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:37,279
such as Gene constructs um Gene

259
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,440
sequences protein sequences

260
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,880
transformation vectors molecular

261
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,279
biology techniques such as those for the

262
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,399
detection of of specific transic

263
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:52,680
events bacterial

264
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,839
strains plant tissue uh

265
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,440
protocols in some countries plant

266
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,320
varieties and seeds are protected by

267
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,240
patents in Colombia they are protected

268
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,839
by by a different kind kind of

269
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,279
of of Ip protection which is the

270
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,360
Breeders

271
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:11,360
rights and all these made it expensive

272
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,120
and in some cases impossible for

273
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,160
developments to be

274
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,639
um actually done with a commercial

275
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,920
purpose in in the

276
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,000
country they were either too expensive

277
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,680
or they were just not

278
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,199
available

279
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,920
however IP protection expires after a

280
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:35,160
certain time most cases it's 20

281
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:38,079
years and patents are only applicable

282
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,279
for a given territory or country or for

283
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,680
the European Union so if there is a

284
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,279
development of technology that is

285
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,199
patented in one country but not in

286
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,399
another that technology can freely be

287
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:49,399
used in in another country will have

288
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,760
after certain amount of time if it's

289
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:56,240
never protected so when a patent expires

290
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,480
or when a technology is not patented in

291
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,040
a country it is in the public domain

292
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,040
that means that it can be freely used um

293
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,920
without infringing third rights um third

294
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,279
party rights and that's where we started

295
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,399
um looking

296
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,000
into Technologies related to

297
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,240
agricultureal biot technology that were

298
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,519
in the public domain in

299
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,480
Colombia this is a topic that has been

300
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:25,040
mentioned in the scientific literature

301
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:29,600
since 2012 as far as we as we have

302
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:33,240
seen where um grusin noted that h the

303
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,760
first biotechnological crops were going

304
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,560
to have been in the market for 20 years

305
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,000
in in

306
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,639
2014 2014 so most of those Technologies

307
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,760
would go into the public domain

308
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,920
Jefferson coined the term act

309
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,199
biogenerics for this these crops and

310
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,480
specifically looked at the case of the

311
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:58,079
glyphosate tolerant soyan which was one

312
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,620
of these first crops to ever come into

313
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,079
into the market

314
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,120
[Music]

315
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:06,360
and there have been some mentions to

316
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,800
this aspect of of different crops and

317
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,920
different Technologies coming into the

318
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:14,040
public domain for the past

319
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,680
decade and we we have been one of the

320
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,320
groups uh that have adopted

321
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,839
this this

322
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,639
model there are two

323
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,279
different types of generic crops if you

324
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:31,839
want to call them like this and they're

325
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:33,800
clearly differentiated as how they are

326
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,240
are produced so first there are

327
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,240
off-patent

328
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:43,240
crops in order to produce an off patent

329
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,079
prop a genetically modified parent say a

330
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,440
corn plant that has a transgenic

331
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,440
event which has entered the public

332
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,079
domain either because it was never

333
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,160
patented or the patent has expired can

334
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:59,079
be crossed with a conventional parent

335
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:02,079
say from a from a variety or genotype

336
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:04,920
that is adapted to a specific climate or

337
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,160
specific region say the corn producing a

338
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,279
corn producing region in

339
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,360
Colombia a hybrid is produced and then

340
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,440
those hybrids are back crossed with a

341
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,320
conventional parent always selecting for

342
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,199
the transgenic trade for the

343
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,399
event and after four or five rounds of

344
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:27,160
of back cross and selection the

345
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:31,120
original conventional genotype is more

346
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:34,240
than 90 99% recovered but as it was

347
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,800
selected keeping in mind that the

348
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,480
the the it still had the transgenic

349
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,720
event we are talking about a new cultiv

350
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,720
which has mostly conventional parents

351
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,680
genotype but the transgenic event but

352
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,880
please bear in mind that this is exactly

353
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,759
the same transgenic event that was in

354
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:56,199
the original J parented it's in the same

355
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:59,399
part of the Corn genome in in this case

356
00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:01,839
so the the transfer of the transic event

357
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:05,000
is done from a GM parent to a

358
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,800
conventional um genotype together with

359
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,759
the flanking regions of the genome so

360
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,399
it's the same transgenic event which is

361
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:16,040
off patent and therefore can be used uh

362
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,360
from the public domain this work was

363
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,720
done by some members of the research

364
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,519
group led by Jenny gimenez baretto

365
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,160
together with fenal which is the The

366
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:30,199
Guild of corn producers in Colombia so

367
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,839
this was a a very a fruitful

368
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:34,560
collaboration between a public

369
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:38,079
university and the corn producers in the

370
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,399
country and were able to develop a new

371
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:45,199
corn hybrid called fenel Tech

372
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:49,880
22 which is actually the first and up

373
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:52,680
until up until now the only genetically

374
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,319
modified crop developed in Colombia that

375
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,160
is planted that actually reached the

376
00:16:55,319 --> 00:17:01,800
market that reached the field and that

377
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,800
it was ever consumed in the

378
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,199
country this is the the work that was

379
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,120
published which summarizes the process

380
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,240
of developing that off patent

381
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,919
event now the second model is the

382
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,640
strictly AC biogeneric a model AC

383
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,720
biogeneric crop and there are some

384
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,000
slight differences we also start with a

385
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,640
commercial gen crop say in this case the

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,880
Roundup Ready soyan which was the first

387
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:37,160
um glyphosate tolerance soy me to be

388
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,160
developed and we look at the expression

389
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,760
cassette that was introduced into that

390
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:45,080
first event to see what elements it's

391
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,880
composed of so there's a promoter uh

392
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,520
Transit peptide for the chloroplast the

393
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,880
coding region for the gene cp4 epsps

394
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,919
which is the one that confers glyphosate

395
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,120
tolerance and and a

396
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,600
Terminator however a similar construct

397
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,919
can be built

398
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,280
maybe changing the promoter maybe

399
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,159
changing the coding sequence but that

400
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,559
produces the same protein and therefore

401
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:11,840
this confers the same characteristic to

402
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:15,159
transform plants so it's a newly

403
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,919
designed expression cassette based on a

404
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:20,280
technology that is well known and that

405
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,000
is in the public domain so maybe there's

406
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,919
a patent that expired for this coding

407
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,679
region uh so it can be freely used in

408
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,880
other different kinds of constructs

409
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,440
maybe a promoter that is better suited

410
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,080
for for the model plant for soyan in

411
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,640
this

412
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,559
case this new genetic construct can be

413
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,919
inserted into a

414
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:45,360
transformation plasmid that is also in

415
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:51,200
the in the public domain and used to

416
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:53,520
transform um soyan plants so the main

417
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,440
difference between an off patent event

418
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,280
or an off patent model and an AC generic

419
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,120
model is that here there is formation of

420
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,120
plants there is not a transfer by sexual

421
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,919
reproduction from one parental to

422
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,280
another but there is actually new

423
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,919
transformation and therefore new H

424
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,559
transgenic events are produced but using

425
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,880
a technology that is in the public

426
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:15,200
domain and this is the model that we

427
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,120
have implemented for soin and that that

428
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,600
I will talk about more during this

429
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,600
presentation and that is still

430
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:29,960
ongoing other than intellectual property

431
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,720
restrictions or aspects that need to be

432
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,559
taken into account in the development of

433
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,320
a of a transgenic crop in Colombia

434
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,799
they're the regulatory aspects which

435
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:45,080
also it can be very costly can make it

436
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:47,600
Al also impossible for some small seed

437
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:50,000
producing companies or for universities

438
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,960
to be able to pay for the regulatory

439
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,039
process to obtain the permissions for

440
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,679
the planting and consumption of

441
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:59,840
transgenic events seeing that we were

442
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,440
dealing with mature technologies that

443
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:06,600
have been proven safe and for which

444
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,559
there is a lot of information available

445
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,440
um we

446
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,240
we were

447
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,679
able to talk to the

448
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,919
regulatory Authority in Colombia which

449
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,840
is the

450
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:23,559
Colombian agary Institute IC or

451
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:28,400
EA which in

452
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:30,679
2021 um updated the regulations for all

453
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,440
aspect related to the research and

454
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,159
production of genetically modified

455
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,159
organisms in the country and thanks to

456
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:41,360
the participation of the group of the

457
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:44,159
our research Group H we were able to

458
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,880
include a simplified process for events

459
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,720
and

460
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,559
technologies that are in the public

461
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,520
domain and have been approved and tested

462
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,559
in the country so uh sorry that I put

463
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,679
this in in Spanish but it's a legal

464
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,679
document so I thought I wouldn't

465
00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:00,000
translate it just explain it during the

466
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:02,600
presentation so there's an a a paragraph

467
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
here that talks about authorized events

468
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,200
that can be transferred to new varieties

469
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,480
in the country but those authorized

470
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,840
events are events that have been

471
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,720
authorized for their use in the country

472
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,360
which have been proven safe and for

473
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,640
which there is information that is

474
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,559
available and that can in and what this

475
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,440
resolution does is that it makes it

476
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:22,760
possible to use that information and to

477
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,159
have a simplified process for

478
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,679
technologies that are we already know

479
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,640
which protein it is we just have to

480
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:32,080
prove that it's the same protein

481
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,760
and something similar happens for what

482
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,559
um here they call similar genetic

483
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,039
constructs which is the same as I just

484
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,720
explain for an AC biogeneric um crop it

485
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:45,400
talks about using a crop with similar

486
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,880
genetic construct to one that has

487
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,440
already been approved and tested in the

488
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:54,679
country

489
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:58,240
so if we start with a looking at the IP

490
00:21:54,679 --> 00:22:00,960
landscape of of a of a crop and we also

491
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:04,080
taking account the regulatory aspects

492
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,080
there's a lot of items and a lot of

493
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,799
information that is already there and

494
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,520
that makes it a theory a lot easier and

495
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,679
less costly uh for for a development to

496
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,159
be

497
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,880
actually produced successfully and this

498
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,880
was proved for off for the off-patent

499
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,080
Corin so adopting the AC biogeneric

500
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,520
model for for Colombia that there's a

501
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,120
workflow

502
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,760
which starts with a freedom to operate

503
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,159
analysis and this is probably ER the

504
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,480
most important aspect and is from the

505
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,600
very beginning of our research project

506
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,760
every single aspect has to be taken into

507
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,520
account H to make sure you're working

508
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,120
from the public domain so that you are

509
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,200
not going to have IP barriers anywhere

510
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,000
along the development and eventual

511
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,360
commercialization of a product and we

512
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,559
adopted this model for herbicide

513
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:04,919
tolerant um specific specifically for

514
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:04,919
glyphosate soybean using Colombian

515
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,679
varieties and this is some of the work

516
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,760
that has been done by different members

517
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,919
of the research group the freedom

518
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,919
operation analysis freedom to operate

519
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:19,000
analysis was performed by Arana roas and

520
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,559
Jenny gimenez and they were able to

521
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
identify all elements of the technology

522
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:25,720
that could be used and that were in the

523
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,600
public domain in the country mostly

524
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,720
because they were never patented here

525
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,520
and some because the had already

526
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:36,919
expired anyhow all

527
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:40,760
the all the analysis included looking at

528
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:43,240
um world databases us databases to make

529
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,919
sure that nothing would be left out of

530
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:50,080
sight J men designed a series of of

531
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:52,039
vectors and and Gene constructs using an

532
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,880
optimized a codon optimized version of

533
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:57,559
the gene cp4 EPS PS so it was not the

534
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,640
exact sequence of the original um

535
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:02,400
Roundup Ready so soin but one that was

536
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,400
optimized for codon usage in soyan that

537
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,240
still produced the same cp4

538
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,320
epsps

539
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,600
protein this was included in a pcambia

540
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,000
1301 plasmid for

541
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:20,039
transformation and Ariana roas did the

542
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,120
first ever transformation assays in the

543
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:25,840
in the group using Colombian varieties

544
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,880
Colombian seeds and was able to obtain

545
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,080
in vitro uh PCR

546
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,120
positive soybean

547
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,799
plants then I I started my my research

548
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,279
work my thesis uh which aimed at

549
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,120
characterizing selecting and taking

550
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,880
those plants to the field in order to

551
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,799
evaluate their agronomic performance

552
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,799
under bio safety however not everything

553
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:53,960
went as planned as we will see in in a

554
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:56,880
moment so we have to revise and adapt

555
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,960
this model um because although we had

556
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,120
some inv vitro plans

557
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,279
we eventually have to do a lot more work

558
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,399
into the transformation regeneration and

559
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:09,080
characterization of those plants so we

560
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:11,279
have to sort of iterate the process in

561
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,480
order to have more more working material

562
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:17,360
so that's how we had to adapt the

563
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,440
model so this was uh the first hardening

564
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,679
assays that we did taking the the plants

565
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,760
from inv vitro conditions to X vitro

566
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:28,480
having plants in in in

567
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:31,360
pots here don't don't have I don't want

568
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,960
to go into two technical details that

569
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,880
are may be interesting for Colombian um

570
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,080
agriculture but these are the varieties

571
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,880
and we were able to harden 11 different

572
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,559
transgenic events which are not many and

573
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,679
the process of taking them from invital

574
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:50,799
conditions to X vure conditions it was

575
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:54,360
really a very difficult process many

576
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,440
plant died many events were lost and

577
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,440
unfortunately well we only managed to

578
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,559
harden 11 but potential events then take

579
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,720
them to the first ever field tests in

580
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,679
the soybean producing region of the

581
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,080
country under contained

582
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:14,760
conditions and what we had to experience

583
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:17,919
there and for those of you who who know

584
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:21,240
colia well I work in bota University in

585
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,880
bota our lab is in bota but the soybean

586
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:29,279
producing region is far east in the

587
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:32,279
Flatlands in in at least five six hours

588
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:34,240
away by car so we were not really close

589
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:38,360
to the field lots of the work had to be

590
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:42,080
remote and so this was also uh a process

591
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:44,570
of adapting how to to do that transition

592
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,559
from lab work to field

593
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:51,480
[Music]

594
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:55,120
work sorry I heard a a

595
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,120
bell I don't know what it

596
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:02,760
means okay

597
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:06,880
and um some events were lost during the

598
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,880
process however we did manage

599
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:16,600
to identify a few PCR positive plants in

600
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,720
the second generation showing that uh

601
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:22,480
the presence of a trans Gene was there

602
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,120
and to test some plants in the field uh

603
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,480
with the application of the of the

604
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:30,120
herbicide very few plants

605
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:33,360
were were actually tolerant in the field

606
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,360
and unfortunately that assay stopped

607
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,760
there and no no seats were were

608
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:41,480
recovered but we did manage to H get to

609
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,039
a point where we saw plants that

610
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,399
tolerated the herbicide in the

611
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:51,000
field however

612
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:53,279
this this um bottleneck where at each

613
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,640
stage lots of plant or lots of events

614
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,640
were lost showed the need to have a lot

615
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,760
more events in order to be able to

616
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,399
select those that could produce the seed

617
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:06,919
and that could H tolerate the herbicide

618
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:13,720
in field conditions so many members of

619
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:16,120
the group um J Rodriguez M Galindo ju

620
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,559
Romero and myself it went back to doing

621
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,159
transformation assays trying to optimize

622
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,159
the transformation process looking at

623
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,120
the interaction between agrobacterium

624
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,320
strains and different soybean varieties

625
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:30,600
we introduced new Colombian varieties um

626
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,679
to see which ones could perform a bit

627
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:36,240
better uh optimizing different aspects

628
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,640
of the tissue culture these are the

629
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,600
different stages because at each stage

630
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,640
well there's a selection using the the

631
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,080
herbicide but there is also a bottleneck

632
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:49,200
due to tissue culture conditions soybean

633
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,559
is a recalcitrant species so it's not

634
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,960
the most um optimal species to work in

635
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:58,840
tissue culture and transformation but we

636
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:02,480
were able to obtain several PCR positive

637
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,640
plants in the field so A New Hope is

638
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,360
born molecular hope of seeing actually

639
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:12,039
PCR positive this was uh work that took

640
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:14,399
a lot longer than was initially

641
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:16,159
expected so we went back to the field

642
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,279
with these plants from new

643
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,880
varieties but we also went back to

644
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:24,480
reality and here is the well the results

645
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:26,840
that were never expected were in the

646
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,880
first and second generation we were not

647
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:32,000
able to identify tolerant plants and we

648
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,440
were not able to identify PCR positive

649
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,919
plant we did not see the inheritance of

650
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,320
the trade we did not see the inheritance

651
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,960
of the gene or the inheritance of the

652
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,640
phenotype characteristic so all the

653
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:48,039
material that we were taking to the

654
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:50,760
field unfortunately was not viable for

655
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:53,440
to continue in in a commercial process

656
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,679
however we did manage to improve the

657
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,880
transformation protocol the hardening

658
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,480
protocol all and all different aspects

659
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,960
of of the tissue culture in the

660
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,320
different conditions and to uh devise a

661
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,480
model to take the plants from the field

662
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,559
from the lab to the field without losing

663
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,360
material and without having

664
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:18,840
to to travel back and forth all the

665
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,559
time however when these um experiments

666
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:24,840
were being performed the

667
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:27,440
pandemic H that we probably all remember

668
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,679
um reached us this made it very

669
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,559
difficult for lab work to be continued

670
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,360
for field work to be continued as I was

671
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:35,120
saying well it was very difficult to

672
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,559
travel to this region of the country so

673
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,960
there was a lot of remote work and most

674
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:42,960
of all we had the death of Professor

675
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,880
Alejandra chaparo who was the director

676
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,440
of the group who was the director of my

677
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,679
thesis and this changed absolutely

678
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,799
everything most of us at the group both

679
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,240
were

680
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:57,080
basically in the air we didn't know what

681
00:30:53,240 --> 00:31:00,080
to do the results were not good and we

682
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:04,519
we were suffering from this terrible

683
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:07,080
loss I was not seeing a thesis anywhere

684
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,960
I didn't see how that could be a thesis

685
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,519
uh time was of the essence because I had

686
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,480
been working on my PhD for for too long

687
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:17,760
now doing repeating experiments that

688
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,320
were not working when they seem to work

689
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,399
they didn't and there was the

690
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,880
pandemic and I was very fortunate to

691
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:28,679
find in my life professor professor

692
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,440
Camilo Lopez gasal from a research group

693
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:34,080
that works closely to two hours for

694
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:37,399
manot biotech he works in in manot

695
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,360
biotechnology and he saw potential in

696
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:42,399
these results he saw potential in me and

697
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,320
he actually was the one who convinced me

698
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,799
that there was a feis and there was

699
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,960
something to be put together there in

700
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:54,240
order to to finish at least the the the

701
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:56,880
PHD process so I can't be ever thankful

702
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,360
enough to to Camilo for for actually

703
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,039
pushing me

704
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,039
and making me see that this was a

705
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,159
possibility although the results were

706
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,320
not ideal there was a lot of work there

707
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:16,799
were a lot of results that that told the

708
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:19,039
story told the story of how a model

709
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,240
could be not only adopted but needed to

710
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:25,760
be adapted um in order to to find those

711
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,799
bottlenecks and to see those those

712
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,639
elements that until you're actually

713
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,440
getting your hands uh in the in the lab

714
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:38,240
getting your feet in the field you don't

715
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:41,399
see what those problems are and that ER

716
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,399
will need to be need to be tackled um so

717
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:47,720
we revised the and we Revisited the the

718
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:51,519
ACT biogeneric model and we we produce

719
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:55,200
this figure which summarizes it uh these

720
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,279
are all the aspects of Designing a gene

721
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,679
transforming bacterial strains plant

722
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,760
varieties

723
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,080
selecting those events that have

724
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,480
potential characterizing them eventually

725
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:12,000
taking to the field and doing all the

726
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:14,840
analysis that are needed for regulatory

727
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,760
aspects the the generic model requires

728
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,159
that intellectual property is taken into

729
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:23,159
account all throughout the

730
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:27,080
process from the gene sequences up to

731
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:28,320
the molecular techniques the information

732
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,120
that is available

733
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,940
about the protein sequences the protein

734
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,279
safety probable allergens

735
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,960
[Music]

736
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:42,960
Etc and each country has its own

737
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,000
regulatory U landscape for genetically

738
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,799
modified crops we working in Colombia

739
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,440
this is not a crop that is

740
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,639
exported soybean so we deal with

741
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,960
Colombian regulatory requirements and we

742
00:33:52,639 --> 00:34:00,080
were actually able to to have these

743
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:03,320
requirements um updated taking into

744
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,159
account the fact that most of the first

745
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,960
generation GN crops are in the public

746
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,599
domain and are well known and have been

747
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,280
approved in the country and um have been

748
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,839
proven safe

749
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,480
so taking into account these regulatory

750
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:19,480
requirements we were able

751
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:23,760
to

752
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:27,200
um influence or or yeah influence the

753
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,240
the updating of of Colombia's regulation

754
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:35,240
in this aspect

755
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:38,079
to to take into account generic by biot

756
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:42,440
technology here it's worth noting that

757
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,240
we have to work most of the time in the

758
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,520
optimization of the transformation

759
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,679
protocol and the inv vitro aspects of

760
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,839
this technology uh taking into account

761
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:56,640
that each element the interaction

762
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,800
between plant variety and bacterial

763
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,920
strain and the different steps in tissue

764
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:06,359
culture are genotype dependent each

765
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,839
plant variety um reacts and operates in

766
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:11,280
a different way so they need to be

767
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,280
constantly updated and

768
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:19,359
analyzed and um well this model has also

769
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,200
been expanding

770
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,160
and this is a work done by danela

771
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,040
portella who who's graduated from her

772
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,599
PhD in the group working with toac

773
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,720
repurposing tobacco for the production

774
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,400
of bioplastics but also under an AC

775
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,160
biogeneric

776
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:41,040
model we also explored how this model

777
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:43,320
could be applied for the development of

778
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,320
late light resistant potatoes in the

779
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,839
country seeing that the genes for this

780
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,720
resistance are well known have been

781
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,480
proven to work and are in the public

782
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,800
domain in the country so there is an

783
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:57,000
opportunity for the production of late

784
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,720
light resistant potato in the country

785
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,440
using a generic

786
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,280
model

787
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:06,359
and genes have also been identified for

788
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,800
the draw draw tolerance in in

789
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:12,760
Maze and well this is a field that needs

790
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,119
to be updated constantly as new genes

791
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,480
new technologies will be entering the

792
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,960
public domain every year as patent

793
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:24,760
expired or as the window for for

794
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,760
patenting also also closes for for seed

795
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,760
producers

796
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,200
so as you can see well the the journey

797
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,880
wasn't easy but I was very lucky to be

798
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,000
surrounded by wonderful people

799
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,480
especially

800
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:44,040
my my colleagues from the group jir mik

801
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:47,480
Juan David Jenny Daniela Lisa

802
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:50,200
danela who who contributed to this work

803
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,720
contributed to the model uh either with

804
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,480
moral support with

805
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,000
results and everyday

806
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,319
collaboration the research group is now

807
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,319
directed by Felipe

808
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:08,280
sento who who has taken over

809
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:12,319
uh and is well now leading the work in

810
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:15,839
soyan in Corin and also other projects

811
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:18,119
in in other species and other

812
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,440
aspects all this work

813
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:24,760
was possible thanks to University

814
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,160
National the Colombia The Guild of corn

815
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,200
soybean producers in the country fenal

816
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:34,000
and I was partly funded by

817
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:37,079
um a loan SL scholarship from the

818
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,839
ministry of Science in in

819
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,520
Colombia please feel free to contact

820
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,240
me if you want to collaborate if you

821
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:46,920
have questions if you would like me to

822
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,640
share some of the papers of the research

823
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,520
that we have done and if you have any

824
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,960
questions please do feel free to to

825
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,760
asking thank you very much thank you

826
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,000
very much Julian so I want to open the

827
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,400
floor to questions and there's going to

828
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,160
be a short survey that we're going to

829
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,800
put into the link uh into the chat and

830
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,240
so please fill out the survey because

831
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,880
you know our your feedback is very

832
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:11,839
important for us and please feel free to

833
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,839
ask any questions in the

834
00:38:13,319 --> 00:38:17,880
chat okay so we have F uh one question

835
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,760
from Elanor young thank you for your

836
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,119
excellent talk do you foresee using the

837
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,760
method you developed to do something

838
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,760
similar with pest disease

839
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:31,079
resistance yeah thank you for for the

840
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:34,760
question um well yes this this

841
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:37,160
model can be applied to any crop or any

842
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,880
technology that is in the public domain

843
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:42,240
so either because it's a well-known

844
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,640
technology that enter the public domain

845
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,520
for because patents expired or they were

846
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:52,000
never patented um and as I mentioned for

847
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,720
the for potato we already did the

848
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,680
freedom to operate analysis for late

849
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:59,040
light resistance and it is in the public

850
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,000
domain in Colombia and probably in many

851
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,319
other countries as

852
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,400
well so yes um that's one specific

853
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:11,240
example the resistance in potato the the

854
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:16,640
off-patent corn that I mentioned

855
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:20,040
before that that specific event H is a

856
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,920
double event which has glufosinate

857
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,240
tolerance a herbicide tolerance but it

858
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,680
also has resistance to

859
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,079
lepidopteran um pests

860
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,040
which are genes many of the cry genes

861
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:36,480
have also entered the public domain so

862
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:39,839
they they can be used in in a generic

863
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,920
model so insect resistance fungal

864
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,440
resistance and probably other other

865
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,440
genes as

866
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,400
well just as a followup what do you

867
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,000
think would be most

868
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,000
beneficial uh in Colombia for this

869
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,599
application like is is there a specific

870
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,520
disease pathogen that you might want to

871
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:06,920
Target or do you think it's better to

872
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,920
improve agriculture using this these

873
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,160
Technologies okay so that would depend

874
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,440
on the crop that we looking at for some

875
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,400
crops maybe the limitation is production

876
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,599
costs where herbicide tolerance can be

877
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,720
very valuable but in other cases

878
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:26,240
uh insect control can be very important

879
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,599
in the case of of Corin so maybe using

880
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:31,640
other insect resistant genes can be very

881
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:35,680
interesting for corn uh for soyan

882
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:38,680
specifically uh rust is a is also a

883
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,000
significant pest so it could be

884
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:44,480
implemented and for

885
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,560
potatoes um late light resistance is of

886
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:52,119
economic significance in in the country

887
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:55,319
um in Colombia there's also corn sorry

888
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:57,680
um cotton GM cotton that that is planted

889
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:59,440
although the area is not very big it is

890
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,079
an important crop in the country and

891
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,040
insect resistance in Cotton um is of is

892
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:07,640
of importance and there are events that

893
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,640
are in the public domain well a thorough

894
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,599
freedom to analysis would need to be

895
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,040
done but I'm pretty sure that there are

896
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,240
insect resistance genes for cotton that

897
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,319
are in the public domain in Colombia so

898
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,000
those are basically the ones that that

899
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:26,440
could be used bear in mind

900
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,680
that part of this model uh is based on

901
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,319
the fact that they are mature

902
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,800
technologies that means technologies

903
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:35,359
that have been well proven so it's not

904
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,839
about making new technologies but using

905
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:40,359
mature Technologies technologies that

906
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:42,920
are well known and putting them in a new

907
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:45,040
context so

908
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:48,040
maybe well Colombia depends on the

909
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,839
import of GM seeds but the technology

910
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,440
itself can be moved from the from these

911
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,240
imported seeds into seeds that are

912
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,800
specifically adapted for Colombian

913
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,880
conditions and that maybe have a better

914
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,640
resistance to local pests and and they

915
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:03,000
need a an extra resistance coming from

916
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,480
from the GM technology or that are very

917
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,400
adapted to the weather conditions or to

918
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,640
the type of soils that we have in the

919
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:15,040
country and the GM characteristic is the

920
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:17,319
A Plus that makes it easier for the for

921
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,160
the producer or cheaper for the producer

922
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:21,520
better for the consumer but it's Al

923
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,000
always based on mature technologies that

924
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,800
are put in a new context the context of

925
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,640
a locally developed uh variety a locally

926
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,440
developed

927
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,680
genotype that's specifically adapted to

928
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,640
the growing conditions in the

929
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,800
country yes so we have quite a few

930
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,240
questions actually we have five

931
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,359
questions active so how difficult is it

932
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,880
to develop and bring a to Market a

933
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:44,119
transgenic product in Colombia with

934
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,599
respect to the USA or Europe from a

935
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:48,440
regulatory

936
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:51,520
perspective okay thank you for your

937
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,520
question ju

938
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:01,160
um Colombia has a very

939
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:04,000
sound regulatory system it's very clear

940
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,319
and um what it's what was one of the

941
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:11,040
first countries to actually develop it

942
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:15,520
its own regulatory aspect for GM crops

943
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:18,640
um so the regulatory aspects are not the

944
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,880
the obstacle I would say and from an IP

945
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,880
perspective probably it's easier in

946
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,599
Colombia to implement this model than in

947
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,800
in Europe or the us because companies

948
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:31,520
usually patent where the market is very

949
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,400
big and for many crops Colombia's Market

950
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,680
is not not very big and many

951
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,119
Technologies are never patented in

952
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,000
Colombia so they are in the public

953
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,359
domain and we don't have to wait for

954
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,359
patents to expire the limitations in a

955
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:48,200
country like like Colombia come from

956
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:53,119
other aspects as I mentioned in during

957
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:55,760
the talk geography is a is um an aspect

958
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,520
that needs to be taken into account

959
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,640
because the the most

960
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:03,480
developed cities and the the lab

961
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,839
Laboratories and the universities that

962
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:09,680
have more resources are in cities that

963
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:11,280
are maybe not close to the regions of

964
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,160
the country where the crops are grown to

965
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,359
agricultural parts of the country so so

966
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,200
there's sort of a miscommunication or or

967
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:22,200
a difficult communication geographically

968
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,640
speaking between laboratory and the

969
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:28,480
field uh there is a very

970
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:31,559
important hub investigation Hub in in

971
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,680
Palm which is cat Alliance for

972
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:35,839
biodiversity cat which have excellent

973
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,319
labs and excellent Fields adjacent to

974
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,280
one another but that's probably the

975
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:42,200
exception in the country and another

976
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,680
aspect is of course the the resources

977
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:49,400
available for or research there is not a

978
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,240
big culture of producers to invest in

979
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:56,000
development because it's a risk and they

980
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,559
have preferred in in many crops to

981
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,079
import seeds

982
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:02,119
rather than develop their own seeds so

983
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,520
there is not a lot of resources for the

984
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:07,000
development of local biotechnology and

985
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,920
locally produced seeds because it's a

986
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,920
risk and it's a lengthy process and

987
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,640
sometimes producers want immediate

988
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,520
results and they would rather just

989
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,559
import seeds than to make them together

990
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,720
collaborating with universities and

991
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:22,480
risking those

992
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,720
resources what are the prospects of Ip

993
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,400
and patent development in Colombia do

994
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,280
you think patenting will become more

995
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,280
feasible in near

996
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,760
future well there's sort of

997
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,000
um

998
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:43,440
attention between different groups in

999
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:47,000
the country on

1000
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,480
how how flexible should patents be and

1001
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,040
or how many patents should be

1002
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,520
granted

1003
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:57,599
um

1004
00:45:54,520 --> 00:46:00,800
so part of that comes from the the the

1005
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,200
free trade agreement with the US and and

1006
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,400
trade agreements with other countries

1007
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,920
which

1008
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,559
require more patents to be granted in

1009
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,559
the country but there are groups in

1010
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:14,400
Colombia that are advocating for more

1011
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:16,480
public domain and for a more strict

1012
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,520
requirements for things to be patented

1013
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,319
for

1014
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,480
example Professor osar laraso from

1015
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:26,240
University naal De Colombia he works in

1016
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,830
the faculty of Law and he has opposed

1017
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,079
patents and and he advocates for

1018
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:33,440
[Music]

1019
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,079
um opening more aspects to the public

1020
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,160
domain not only in agricultural

1021
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:41,040
biotechnology but also in pharmaceutical

1022
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,880
biotechnology advocating for more

1023
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,839
Technologies to be available for

1024
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,359
Colombian developers and Colombian

1025
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:51,119
researchers uh so yeah there's a

1026
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:52,140
tension I don't know where where it's

1027
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,400
going

1028
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:56,000
[Music]

1029
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:01,760
um sometimes it seems that more things

1030
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,440
are are being p it but there's always um

1031
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,480
new technologies coming into the public

1032
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,480
domain just because of of time and and

1033
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:12,680
expiration so um this is going to be a

1034
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,200
decade where each year many genes many

1035
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,920
technologies that were ever patented or

1036
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,599
patents that were requested will come

1037
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,599
into the public

1038
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,400
domain so we're coming up uh to the I

1039
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,160
will stay on as long as we have

1040
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,960
questions please feel free to stay

1041
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,640
congrats as an alumni from the biology

1042
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,640
program at the University at NAS

1043
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:39,720
Columbia it's excellent to see of your

1044
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:42,040
achievements um see thank you very much

1045
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:43,920
uh do you see any institutional interest

1046
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,160
from Colombian governmental or private

1047
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,880
sector agencies to use this kind of

1048
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,559
Technology towards improving food

1049
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:54,520
production and quality in

1050
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:57,880
Colombia okay thank you Juan for your

1051
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:00,839
question um well sometimes the the

1052
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,839
message is a bit

1053
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:07,119
contradictory because this is a

1054
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,760
technology that has a certain opposition

1055
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:12,000
in in the country and I guess in every

1056
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,920
single country but that producers

1057
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,599
actually asked for it and and and look

1058
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:20,240
forward to to having it h but

1059
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,800
specifically we have collaborated with

1060
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,160
um

1061
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:27,359
depart the national planning department

1062
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,319
uh that is working on a policy Bri on

1063
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:33,720
the use of public domain

1064
00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:37,319
Technologies for um for the development

1065
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:39,960
of of biotechnology in the country and

1066
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:43,079
they are using our research as one of

1067
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:45,280
the examples of how the public domain is

1068
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:47,760
a source and is something that can be

1069
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,799
mined that can be exploited because

1070
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:53,760
there's a lot of information there that

1071
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:55,359
that maybe is not used enough so yes

1072
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,839
there is an interest we have been

1073
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:00,680
contacted by the by the national

1074
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:03,880
planning department and well they they

1075
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:06,319
work in different aspects pharmaceutical

1076
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,960
biotechnology engineering but also

1077
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:11,799
agricultural biotechnology and they use

1078
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,799
our work as an example of

1079
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,319
this okay next question what do you

1080
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,880
think about the barriers related to

1081
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:24,799
intellectual property and crisper

1082
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,040
technology particularly for developing

1083
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:29,880
countries well this is an issue thank

1084
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:32,400
you for for that question that we have H

1085
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,799
delved over quite a few times asking

1086
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,400
ourselves if we should be working with

1087
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:39,440
crisper and and Gene editing genome

1088
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:42,319
editing in general and Professor chaparo

1089
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:45,440
asked this question almost every meeting

1090
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:48,040
every group meeting that we had and

1091
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,440
um well I think it's a technology that

1092
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,240
we should be aware of that we should

1093
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,640
learn how to use and that many

1094
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:56,200
researchers in the country are are using

1095
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,520
or several researchers in the country

1096
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,400
are using with with great

1097
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,839
advancements but that is not going to

1098
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:08,000
reach the field anytime soon probably

1099
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:10,079
because of Ip barriers ER in Colombia

1100
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,400
you can use the crisper technology for

1101
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,280
research purposes only but if you want

1102
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,559
to develop a commercial product you need

1103
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,240
to license the technology and sometimes

1104
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,599
that is just not

1105
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,559
possible or too

1106
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:25,400
expensive before starting with the ACT

1107
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,480
biog generic model we tried to contact

1108
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,640
some companies to see if they would were

1109
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:32,799
would be open to license not Gene

1110
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:36,880
editing technology but transgenic

1111
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:38,760
technology and we didn't receive answers

1112
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,200
so it's not that they didn't refuse to

1113
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,839
license or it was too expensive they

1114
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:45,319
just didn't reply the

1115
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:47,640
email so something similar might happen

1116
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:49,760
with with chrisper technology where

1117
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:51,599
where developments don't come out of the

1118
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:55,920
lab and if they

1119
00:50:51,599 --> 00:51:00,280
are um eventually profitable will the

1120
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,280
the prices or licensing would be quite

1121
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,520
steep your next question what would you

1122
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,920
say to Young researchers who want to

1123
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,880
dedicate their careers to investigations

1124
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,799
like this for example regarding the

1125
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,920
challenges and opportunities thanks for

1126
00:51:13,799 --> 00:51:18,720
the

1127
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:20,680
talk thank you for your

1128
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,640
question I would

1129
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:26,280
say go

1130
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,119
ahead surround yourself very well with

1131
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,839
great people people that you trust

1132
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,160
people that are there for you that's

1133
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:34,920
more important than the the plants the

1134
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:38,960
genes the lab the machines because you

1135
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,760
will eventually need a lot of help and

1136
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,319
that can only be given by by by good

1137
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,319
people around

1138
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,400
you any other problem can be

1139
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:52,760
solved uh there so there's yeah three

1140
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,720
more questions right now so what are the

1141
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,599
advantages of this public domain based

1142
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,280
model compared to chrisper cast Gene EDI

1143
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,559
thanks great

1144
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:07,280
work thank you

1145
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:09,760
Oscar well the main advantage is that

1146
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,280
it's free to use that it's in the public

1147
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,079
domain and therefore doesn't need to be

1148
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:17,359
licensed in order to be used so it can

1149
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:20,640
from the beginning have a commercial uh

1150
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:23,599
commercial aim um not just for

1151
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,720
research if you're working with crisper

1152
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,280
and you want to eventually have a

1153
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,280
commercial product you you need to bear

1154
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:33,480
that in mind from the very beginning

1155
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,200
that you will need a license and that um

1156
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,720
probably as a as a researcher in a

1157
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,440
Colombian University you're not the one

1158
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,079
who's going to be H putting the

1159
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,440
conditions for that license so you

1160
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:46,160
you're going to have to accept what the

1161
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:49,160
owners of the technology are going to to

1162
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:51,480
demand of you um so if you want a

1163
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,839
commercial product which was the aim of

1164
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,960
the groups since the very beginning for

1165
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:59,240
the seats to actually reach the field uh

1166
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:01,000
working from from a generic perspective

1167
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:05,200
using elements from the public domain

1168
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,960
that's a great advantage and uh at least

1169
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:10,480
in in theory it reduces costs greatly

1170
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:13,559
because you don't have to assume the

1171
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,280
costs of binding the genes discovering

1172
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:17,319
the genes proving that they work pro

1173
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,680
proving the concept the the proof of

1174
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:23,000
concept has been done um because these

1175
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,880
are mature Technologies and you can also

1176
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
um use some of the regulatory

1177
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,280
information

1178
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,160
that has been produced about the safety

1179
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,559
and efficacy of of these Technologies so

1180
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:38,359
so you would be cutting down costs and

1181
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:40,799
time uh using all the information that's

1182
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:40,799
already

1183
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:49,000
available all right so uh for the just

1184
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,040
another reminder uh please fill out the

1185
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,160
survey link I fixed it so that you don't

1186
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,839
have to request so it should be freely

1187
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,280
accessible and available to everyone uh

1188
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,400
next question is is from an anonymous

1189
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,559
attendee to what extent has the off

1190
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,599
patent corn develop by you been adopted

1191
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,760
by farmers in Colombia and how has it

1192
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:06,760
been

1193
00:54:08,359 --> 00:54:15,160
accepted okay thank

1194
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:18,559
you the off patent development was done

1195
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:21,680
together with um with a guild of corent

1196
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:24,040
producers which is fenal

1197
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:26,480
which are actually the farmers

1198
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:30,040
themselves which are in in a guild that

1199
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:33,200
that uh dedicate some of their profits

1200
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:35,119
to research and development of coren

1201
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:39,160
seeds so it

1202
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:41,400
was they themselves who promoted this

1203
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:44,920
this use of the

1204
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:47,880
technology they are importers of seats

1205
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:49,760
biotechnological seats and they wanted

1206
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,880
this technology to be available in the

1207
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,520
seats that were developed by them it was

1208
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,799
introduced into a genotype that was

1209
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,400
developed by the producers themselves

1210
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:01,760
because it's adapted to

1211
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:05,440
Colombian conditions so so the interest

1212
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:07,400
actually not it didn't come only from

1213
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,760
the University looking for someone to

1214
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:12,559
finance the project but the producers

1215
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,480
themselves looking for researchers who

1216
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,599
could bring biotechnological

1217
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,880
developments to their varieties and

1218
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:21,880
their genotypes I however do not have

1219
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:24,400
the information of the

1220
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:27,160
extension the area that has been planted

1221
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,240
or the or the

1222
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:32,440
the

1223
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:36,280
production that has been done using this

1224
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:38,480
specific um hybrid feltech 22 but I do

1225
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:41,200
know that it has been planted and is

1226
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:44,039
planted in Colombia because um the city

1227
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:46,160
is available for sale and it has all the

1228
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:49,520
all the approvals from the national

1229
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:53,839
authorities for for their use uh both in

1230
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,839
the field and for its consumption

1231
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,520
okay last question Anonymous attendee do

1232
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:08,119
you think public sentiment towards GM

1233
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:11,839
technology has changed do you think that

1234
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:11,839
there are effective ways to improve

1235
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:19,680
perception um yes I do think it has

1236
00:56:17,799 --> 00:56:22,400
changed the

1237
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:25,359
focus of the opposition to GM technology

1238
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:27,760
I think has changed from from a safety

1239
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:30,559
point of view which used to be the the

1240
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:32,960
original concern to to put in in a

1241
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,760
certain way I think GM crops the GM

1242
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:38,400
crops that are in the market have been

1243
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:41,160
proven safe once and again and that I

1244
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:44,280
don't think is the main concern I think

1245
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:48,280
the concern among consumers

1246
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:52,039
and um general public is more about the

1247
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:55,039
whole industrial agricultural model um

1248
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:56,559
monocrops um the use of herbicides

1249
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:59,520
pesticides

1250
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:02,799
um agricultural biodiversity what

1251
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:06,319
happens with the seats that

1252
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:09,760
are local varieties things like this and

1253
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:13,160
how how how can they live together with

1254
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:16,000
GM crops uh not from the the

1255
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:18,200
biosafety perspective and I think these

1256
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
are very valid questions that need to be

1257
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:22,960
addressed in any type of Agriculture um

1258
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,400
and that are not necessarily related to

1259
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,960
to a cro being GM but maybe to an

1260
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,640
industrial

1261
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:33,000
um agricultural model that needs to to

1262
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:35,039
be complemented by non-industrial

1263
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,960
Agriculture and I think researchers are

1264
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:41,720
more aware of of of this and the way in

1265
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:45,280
which perception can be improved is

1266
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:47,319
precisely by breaking the link between a

1267
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,880
certain type of Agriculture and GM

1268
00:57:47,319 --> 00:57:51,760
technology these are two different

1269
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:54,400
things GM technology as it as it says

1270
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:57,240
it's a technology it's how a gene is

1271
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,520
introduced into a crop and it has been

1272
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,440
associated with certain crops and

1273
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:03,480
certain models but it doesn't have to be

1274
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,839
that way um I think there is a

1275
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:06,880
compatibility between organic

1276
00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:10,240
Agriculture and GM technology for

1277
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:12,359
example um and another aspect that I

1278
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,400
think could help to improve public

1279
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:16,480
perception in a country like Colombia is

1280
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,839
precisely by having GM crops that have

1281
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,079
been developed in the country H by local

1282
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:24,280
producers with local varieties by a

1283
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:26,440
public university and that is not

1284
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:30,440
necessarily associated with import Ed

1285
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,440
seats at technology coming from from

1286
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:37,599
outside all right thank you again uh

1287
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,240
please fill out the survey you'll also

1288
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,920
get an email link um thank you again to

1289
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,319
our speaker Julian that was a fantastic

1290
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,079
talk it was actually the biggest group

1291
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:48,720
we've ever had for the speaker series um

1292
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:51,760
and you know starting the new year

1293
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,880
strong uh we are overtime and I'm being

1294
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,720
kicked out of the room so I will have to

1295
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,880
end the meeting if you any other

1296
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:01,400
questions please contact us or Dr Julian

1297
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:05,599
Mora

1298
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:09,000
Ober uh whenever you see fit um thank

1299
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,000
you once again
