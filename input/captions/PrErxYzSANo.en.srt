1
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:20,199
okay this uh lecture is uh applies to

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:24,720
every Matrix and it comes really near

3
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:29,080
the beginning of linear algebra uh

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,000
elimination is the the powerful way to

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,200
make the Matrix simpler get a lot of

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,120
zeros in it is what is actually achieved

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,239
by

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,520
elimination uh but then it's a little

9
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:46,120
question what have I done what how do I

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:49,399
describe the answer and I think

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,559
factorizations which you'll see are the

12
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:56,079
fundamental theme in linear algebra or

13
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,320
give a great uh description of

14
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,519
elimination you can see what you've done

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,879
and this

16
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:07,680
factorization

17
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:11,799
uh takes any Matrix a any rectangular

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,640
Matrix Square rectangular and finds a

19
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:18,400
column Matrix and a row Matrix that

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,439
multiplies so it's maybe the first of

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,520
our six factorizations that really

22
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,360
organize the linear algebra course so

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,640
ready to start on this so elimination is

24
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:36,360
familiar but this fact factorization is

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:40,600
more is newer okay uh so I'm going to

26
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,399
take an example there is a matrix a 3x4

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,320
pretty arbitrary

28
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:49,280
Matrix um so uh and I want to do

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,759
elimination to it let me just describe

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,079
elimination how it would start in words

31
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:59,320
I would say I want to turn that three

32
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,880
into a zero so I take three * Row one

33
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,960
and subra ract from row two and that

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,799
gives me a zero there and it gives me

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:13,080
something else and I take four times Row

36
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:17,879
one from Row three and that gives me a

37
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:21,319
zero I think yeah uh the that this is

38
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:24,040
the process that you repeat multiples

39
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:28,040
and and the subtractions can go upwards

40
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,400
here I can I could after I've taken

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,360
three of these away from row two I have

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,519
a new row two I can take some multiple

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,560
of that row two away from Row

44
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,959
one and produce that

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,519
zero I I don't plan to discuss all the

46
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,560
horrible details of elimination right

47
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,840
here just this but I'll tell you the

48
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,440
operations and for this Matrix I end up

49
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:02,400
with that Matrix that this is what

50
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:06,360
elimination goes to if we go the whole

51
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:10,519
way we get a couple of columns so how do

52
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:15,360
I how do I under understand this Matrix

53
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:20,120
Z which came from a well let's see if I

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:23,879
look at the rows I see two nonzero rows

55
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,680
and that that turns out they turn out to

56
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:29,799
be a basis for the row space the

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,480
combinations of those two rows give me

58
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,560
any all of the three rows of a and

59
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,720
notice that there's a zero row so the

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:43,680
rank is only two for this Matrix this

61
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:46,799
Matrix has only two uh nonzero rows in

62
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,480
when it after at the end of elimination

63
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,079
and so so there are bases for the row

64
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,760
space which is

65
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:57,519
two-dimensional and the columns the

66
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,319
first two so the first two columns here

67
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,760
are that's the destination that's the

68
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,519
goal of elimination to get these ones

69
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:10,319
and zeros so they tell us that these two

70
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:13,519
columns were and we'll call those those

71
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,919
those are the First Independent columns

72
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,239
these columns are independent of the

73
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:23,000
previous ones but the last two columns

74
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,240
are combinations of the first two so the

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,479
column space of this Matrix is the same

76
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,320
as the column space is sorry has the

77
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:35,199
same

78
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,919
same basis the same we we learn about

79
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,960
the column space of this Matrix from the

80
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,280
column space of this one so that's point

81
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,320
two The Columns of

82
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:51,960
a these first two columns are a basis

83
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,759
for the column space of a because they

84
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:59,120
became clearly the basis when we went to

85
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,360
Z and finally the null space if we want

86
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,720
to solve

87
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:09,400
axal 0 we this makes us this moves us to

88
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,400
solving ZX equals 0 that null space is

89
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,919
null meaning zero and that that on the

90
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:21,319
right hand side so to solve ZX equals

91
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:24,240
zero uh is easy as and we'll do it in a

92
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:28,280
minute and that will be the same

93
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,919
Solutions as ax equals z so that's

94
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:36,400
that's what elimination it chieves the

95
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:39,639
uh these sub these subspaces have move

96
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,039
in a simple one simple form or connected

97
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:48,080
in a nice way from A to Z okay ready for

98
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:50,319
the next slide yeah all right and I make

99
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,319
it

100
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:59,680
happen oh okay and now my new point is

101
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,520
to see that elimination process which is

102
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:07,120
has been taught in linear algebra for

103
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:10,960
quite a long time I want to see it this

104
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,759
step from the a that we started with to

105
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,759
the elimination Matrix that we ended

106
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,520
with tells me that this original Matrix

107
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,440
factors into a column Matrix times a row

108
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,880
Matrix C time R that's a that'll be then

109
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,240
the first factorization in the linear

110
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:33,800
algebra textbook it comes

111
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,240
first and then the great factorizations

112
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:42,240
of linear algebra like igen values and

113
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:45,199
singular values are build out of this so

114
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:50,319
but this is a factorization every Matrix

115
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,479
a factors by doing that elimination into

116
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,360
uh the column Matrix it has two

117
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:59,879
independent columns just as a has and it

118
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,840
has two independent rows just as a has

119
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:06,479
and what does that tell us that tells us

120
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,800
the two two equaling two there that the

121
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:13,039
column Rank and the row rank are the

122
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,240
same which is really the first wonderful

123
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,759
fact in linear algebra that if I take

124
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,199
any Matrix and if you just glance at

125
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,960
that you can't see how many rows are

126
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,479
independent how many columns are

127
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,240
independent but the number is two in

128
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:30,280
both cases always equal okay now I have

129
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,000
to

130
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:39,000
explain use Matrix notation to say what

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,520
that R Matrix is okay so I start with a

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,520
and I'm all I'll always use little r for

133
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,919
the rank the number of independent

134
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:50,560
columns and you remember that those go

135
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,759
into C so I'm just able to tell you what

136
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,599
the r factor

137
00:07:52,759 --> 00:08:00,639
is so that's the maybe the a

138
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:03,800
key idea here that it's not not usually

139
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:07,360
in textbooks what is that R well it

140
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:11,720
starts with the identity Matrix and then

141
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:15,319
it has a matrix F that that accounts for

142
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:18,840
the dependent columns so the identity

143
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:22,520
Matrix is sitting in the in the columns

144
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:27,280
that are independent in a the first the

145
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:30,560
first uh uh L R

146
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,519
columns independent columns and then the

147
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,360
F

148
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:39,680
Matrix so the F Matrix the matrices

149
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,959
there are dependent on the columns in C

150
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,320
and that tells us that they're

151
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:50,560
combinations so so what's what's there

152
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:55,080
is uh those those columns of of the

153
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:58,760
Matrix a have the form C * F so f is the

154
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,959
Matrix that makes this correct and

155
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,839
annoyingly

156
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:07,440
there we may need to re reorder The

157
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,680
Columns because in my nice example the

158
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,079
independent columns came first columns

159
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,839
one and two but I could if I move those

160
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:18,839
off to the right then I need to get them

161
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,040
back to the left again for my nice

162
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:24,399
picture and it's that permutation P that

163
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,200
does it don't pay a lot of attention to

164
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,600
P here's the important part the the

165
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,000
independent columns and then The Matrix

166
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,920
that tells us how to get the dependent

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,399
columns from the Independent columns by

168
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,920
multiplying by F okay so that's the

169
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,600
that's the factorization and now I want

170
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:50,200
to use it oh I I did an example that

171
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,360
involves P that requires a permutation

172
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,519
yeah it's a good example to look at so

173
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,040
there's our original Matrix a and if I

174
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,240
look for the independent columns well

175
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,720
column one is great okay column two is

176
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,600
not so great because it's dependent it's

177
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,880
just two * column 1 nothing new in

178
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,680
column two so that's a dependent column

179
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,680
and then column three we do have an

180
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,120
independent column so the two

181
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:22,959
independent columns go into C and that's

182
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:26,959
the Matrix that multiplies R and you you

183
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,880
see how a permutation May in this form

184
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,560
the

185
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,640
identity is over over on the fully on

186
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,720
the left side that this has columns one

187
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,600
and two as special but it's the

188
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,000
permutation then that makes columns one

189
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,720
and put puts them into columns one and

190
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,079
three which are really the special

191
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,720
independent columns for a that and that

192
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:55,839
okay so that's just a word about p and

193
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,360
from now on I'll try to forget there

194
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,639
there might be a p Matrix okay if

195
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,200
essential

196
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,279
information what what does elimination

197
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,760
accomplish after all these thousands of

198
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:13,440
years that was vented in China uh more

199
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:16,839
than 2,000 years ago the the information

200
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,560
it is it tells us which columns are

201
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:23,040
independent then there in the identity

202
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:27,360
Matrix shows up in those columns and it

203
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,360
also tells us the Matrix the how the

204
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,680
dependent ones come from the IND dep

205
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,440
dependent ones you multiply C by some

206
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:39,240
Matrix F which elimination finds so

207
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,320
elimination finds all these matrices as

208
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:47,320
we saw in that example and now I want to

209
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:50,440
use that to see what that Matrix right

210
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,839
down here with with a slide or two uh

211
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,279
just exactly what steps of elimination

212
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:01,040
are are allowed so elimination has three

213
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:05,000
simple steps and all of them are rever

214
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,200
reversible uh like exchange two rows

215
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
because if I had a zero on the top left

216
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,440
corner I wouldn't want that so I would

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,480
do a row exchange I I divide I can

218
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,079
divide a row by a number if I had a two

219
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,000
in the top left corner I'd rather have a

220
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:27,199
one so I just divide that row by two and

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,120
this is the main step to subtract a

222
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:33,040
multiple of one row from another row

223
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:36,440
that doesn't change the row space just

224
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,480
changes the the rows themselves but

225
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,800
their combinations have not changed all

226
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,680
these uh three three steps are

227
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,079
reversible if I exchange two rows I

228
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,600
could exchange them again and I'd be

229
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,839
back to where I started if I divide by

230
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,120
seven then I could multiply by seven or

231
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,480
divide by

232
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,800
17th uh so so this is what

233
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,800
is

234
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,680
always if you get this topic in a linear

235
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,240
algebra course this is the Matrix that

236
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,680
you get to and what I want to do is

237
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,079
understand that

238
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:22,360
Matrix uh as coming as entering a

239
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:24,959
factorization of a so I can use

240
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,440
elimination this is so that but that's

241
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:32,720
the picture of what I get as we saw all

242
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:35,440
right so so that's this is the key fact

243
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,320
we're we're sort of like ending the work

244
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,079
of

245
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,720
elimination it can get it'll find out

246
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:44,880
how many independent columns there are

247
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,440
how many independent rows and that

248
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,440
numberb is the same because we're

249
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:54,079
looking at the identity Matrix and then

250
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:58,279
we we see how this is the simplification

251
00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:02,279
of the of the Matrix a okay so what can

252
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:04,839
we do what do we learn from that oh so I

253
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:06,920
I I put in a few slides just to say how

254
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:11,160
would you code

255
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:14,639
elimination uh and it's really neat it's

256
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:18,680
so it's how how does elimination work

257
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:22,560
well column by column so suppose we've

258
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:25,440
got K columns done and we're ready for

259
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,000
the next one like we may have seven

260
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,160
columns taken care of we're ready for

261
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,519
column eight so this is what column 7

262
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:39,120
looks like because it's that same if

263
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:41,639
f0000 P picture it's those seven columns

264
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,759
are finished and now here's one and I

265
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:47,639
let U be the upper part upper half and L

266
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:50,440
be the lower half U is the half that's

267
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,920
or the part that's that's of the new

268
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:57,639
column that's that goes up at the top

269
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,360
and even with the zeros goes l

270
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:04,120
so what what do we do in what does

271
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,720
elimination do with this next column so

272
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,880
I'm describing elimination again in a

273
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,759
way you would code it uh I come to the

274
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,480
new column all right and I want to know

275
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,360
I'm I want something a picture like this

276
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,160
with K moved up to k +

277
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:26,440
one okay it's a lot to give you the all

278
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,040
the details of elimination but there

279
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,480
there everybody catches on to them by

280
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:36,759
doing a few either on a computer or or

281
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:39,399
by hand okay so our question is this is

282
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:41,519
I want a picture like this after one

283
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,319
with one more column in it and the

284
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:49,120
question is is this new column going to

285
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:51,959
feed into the identity well if if L is

286
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:58,440
the zero Vector if if it's all if it's

287
00:15:51,959 --> 00:16:03,199
all zeros below the pivot then uh then

288
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:06,720
this U will go along with f because we

289
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:09,600
we're not getting anything new the we

290
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,920
still have K nonzero rows so at this

291
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:17,279
point we have K nonzero rows or or let's

292
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:21,920
say whatever number we whatever number

293
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:24,600
we have and if L is zero then the new

294
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:30,199
column is dependent on the old columns

295
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:33,319
and doesn't add anything new uh so so if

296
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:36,880
again I'll just repeat if L is the zero

297
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:40,639
Vector if I'm all zeros here then that

298
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:45,440
will go in with f if it's not all zeros

299
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:50,240
there then I then I'm going to do some

300
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:53,880
row exchanges and some pivot steps uh I

301
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,480
can I what I can do is clear out all of

302
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:00,800
L except for one non zero that'll be the

303
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,519
new pivot maybe the next I hope hope the

304
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,880
next

305
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:10,039
uh so if L is all Zer the new column is

306
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,640
joins with f if L is not all zero the

307
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:16,799
new column is independent so we we've

308
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,319
hit another independent column and we uh

309
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,480
do

310
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:25,000
elimination on that column to to get it

311
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:28,439
into the right form to be ready for

312
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,200
column the column K plus 2 is coming

313
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:35,880
next I I don't you the way to learn the

314
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:40,520
steps of elimination is to is to do them

315
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:44,960
on a few matrices and I won't do more

316
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:48,000
here okay so just but but I want you to

317
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,840
know what is elimination telling us so

318
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,120
the result of elimination tells us which

319
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,559
are the First Independent columns

320
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:58,440
they're the ones that end up with a one

321
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:00,960
with the identity Matrix there's and

322
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:05,480
they're the and those first

323
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,760
columns back in a are The Columns of C

324
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,679
the row space is not change those

325
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,360
operations of elimination don't change

326
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:16,320
the row space but but they give us a

327
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:20,919
nice picture so

328
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,880
so so the th this thing is this slide is

329
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:28,000
really telling us that the result of

330
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,280
elimination is the identity Matrix the C

331
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,360
Matrix

332
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,799
and zeros in in the low in the lower

333
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,840
rows we can see how many rows are

334
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:41,360
independent by how many the the nonzero

335
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:45,840
rows are all independent because they

336
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:49,200
that identity is is makes that so so

337
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,960
that's that's where we are uh at the end

338
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,480
of

339
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:57,840
elimination we have little r the rank

340
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:00,240
then the the the dimension of of the row

341
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,039
space the dimension of the column space

342
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:07,960
is little r and we can

343
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:12,679
see the basis for it in C and then we

344
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:16,919
also have that Matrix F so we got to C

345
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:20,799
and F and elimination

346
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:24,520
finished by giving us a picture of the

347
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:29,080
original Matrix much simplified lots of

348
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:32,880
zeros okay oh all right and let's just

349
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:36,240
apply it so here we go you this is the

350
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:40,559
payoff do you rem remember our Matrix

351
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,880
that had 13 27 that was my example at

352
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,559
the very beginning but it had some

353
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,640
combination of those two rows so this

354
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:51,600
third row I've just forgotten because it

355
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:55,320
turned out to be a combination of these

356
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:58,960
and and gave us a row of zeros so these

357
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:01,960
are the two equations in axal 0 we're

358
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:06,240
looking for the n space this is what

359
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:09,840
elimination is tells us how what how to

360
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,039
do it's a step to simplify the equations

361
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,799
from that messy looking two two

362
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:20,280
equations to this simple pair of

363
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:23,559
equations where the one and the one are

364
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:26,240
in columns one and two and and nice

365
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:29,799
numbers and the point is you can solve

366
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:34,520
those without taking a linear out of a

367
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:37,840
course but still take the course okay so

368
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:41,280
I'm looking for solutions to that okay

369
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,919
so I could find a solution if I said X3

370
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:50,559
to be one and X4 to be zero so X4 is

371
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:55,480
zero that's gone X3 is 1 so X1 + 3 = 0

372
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:59,000
X2 + 4 = 0 so X1 and X2 are Min -3 and

373
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,679
-4 and there's the one and the zero did

374
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,400
you see that we produce that solution

375
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:10,200
just by I it jumps out and let's see how

376
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,320
the next one jumps out so we suppose we

377
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,200
take those equations those are the

378
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:19,039
simple form of this horrible horrible

379
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,840
pair we got that we got it to a very

380
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,520
simple form and now I want to know

381
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,559
another solution and another different

382
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,240
certainly different one will be to set

383
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:33,039
X3 equals z so that's gone

384
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:36,840
X4 equal to 1 so that's five and six and

385
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:41,640
then I need X1 to be minus 5 and X2 to

386
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:45,400
be minus 6 to cancel a five and six

387
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:49,440
golden solution Simple Solution complete

388
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:51,120
so I've got two solutions to ax equals z

389
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,559
and the null space has the right

390
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,600
Dimension two and I found a basis for

391
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,559
that space and all other Solutions are

392
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,760
combinations of these Simple Solutions

393
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:08,240
The Simple Solutions have zeros and ones

394
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,240
in the dependent

395
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,400
columns I hope you can just see that

396
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:18,120
after elimination when we get to a

397
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,080
simple form like that it becomes a

398
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:24,600
picnic to solve it the equations are

399
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:27,679
easily solved just let X3 = 1 and X4

400
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,360
equal 0 and you get an answer let X3

401
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,760
equal 0 and X4 equal 1 you get another

402
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:37,159
answer so so that was that's the point

403
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,200
of elimination it's good to make the

404
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:42,400
what was the point of learning this

405
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:48,480
process or coding up this process it's

406
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:53,159
not I have to admit that it's not uh um

407
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:56,279
the most super efficient way to find the

408
00:22:53,159 --> 00:23:00,360
solution uh because it involves

409
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:03,640
subtraction of rows of from rows

410
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:08,360
above and as well as subtraction from

411
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:12,159
rows below so it could be speed it

412
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:13,320
up uh and it usually is for for square

413
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,320
invertible

414
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,760
matrices for let let me ask you this

415
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,600
question if I had a square 4x4

416
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:26,840
invertible Matrix what would over here

417
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:29,360
what would be the the uh reduced form

418
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:33,360
after I do elimination

419
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,880
well it would just be identity identity

420
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,080
the identity Matrix if if I had a 4X for

421
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,080
if I have an invertible Matrix

422
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,159
elimination produces the identity Matrix

423
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,720
so it really goes all the way to

424
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,760
simplifying The Matrix and and you pay a

425
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:54,679
little price if if to get all the way to

426
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:58,840
the identity Matrix but to see the

427
00:23:54,679 --> 00:24:01,960
theory it's it's a right thing to do we

428
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:05,880
won't do we wouldn't actually do it we

429
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:08,520
would stop at a triangular Matrix and

430
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,400
start solving from that point if we had

431
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:14,400
to pay for the for the for the computer

432
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:18,559
time all right and now here I've written

433
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,360
in with Matrix notation what that last

434
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,360
slide showed you and again what that

435
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,760
last slide showed you is that once you

436
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:31,320
have it have completed elimination it's

437
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:35,159
a cinch to solve a x equals z yeah so so

438
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:38,760
we we elimination puts a into that form

439
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:41,240
and then the solutions X are in this

440
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,799
form and If I multiply that by that I

441
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,960
get

442
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:50,480
zero so The Columns of X solve ax equals

443
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:55,240
z I have found the null

444
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:59,360
space I've computed the n space and

445
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:02,720
uh what I wanted to do was to show that

446
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,440
elimination does its job makes it simple

447
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,240
it makes the null space jump out you

448
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,720
just need the F it comes from

449
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,399
elimination the possible

450
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,440
permutations and you've got the answer

451
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:23,399
you've got the the x is that solve ax

452
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:27,480
equals z okay again uh it's not the the

453
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:30,159
code that's used all the time in in

454
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:35,480
Computing problems in physics or

455
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:38,080
engineering but it's for math it

456
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,799
elimination completed elimination as

457
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,760
we've done really gets you to the point

458
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,399
where you can read off the answer

459
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,120
okay so that's the point really is to

460
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:52,720
see how far elimination gets

461
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,840
you okay oh here so here's the comment

462
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,320
that I have just been making what the

463
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:03,159
method that we pushed all the way to get

464
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,960
the identity Matrix is not as efficient

465
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,080
as

466
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:12,039
gaus gaus the greatest mathematician of

467
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,600
all time he uh knew he knew enough to

468
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:17,279
stop when the Matrix was

469
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,279
triangular instead of getting to a

470
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:23,720
matrix that's could could well be

471
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:26,480
diagonal uh he doesn't do the

472
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,360
subtractions from upper rows he just

473
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,960
goes from subtracts multiples of a row

474
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,559
from lower rows and that makes the

475
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:41,120
Matrix triangular and then solving is

476
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:44,559
easy so just want you to and that's the

477
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,880
the the oper the steps that you really

478
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:50,320
everybody learns in linear algebra

479
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:54,120
elimination from The Matrix from a

480
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,840
square Matrix to a triangular one and

481
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,760
then solution is a

482
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,679
cinch okay

483
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,120
all right I'm near the end I just want

484
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,120
to

485
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,120
express what I did in Matrix notation

486
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:13,799
actually that's sort of the fundamental

487
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:16,279
idea of this of this uh lecture that I'm

488
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:20,760
sort of extra lecture on

489
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:25,240
elimination um is to see what's

490
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:27,880
happening in Matrix language we know if

491
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,120
you take the course and you grind

492
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,559
through a few examples of elimination

493
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:36,799
then you know the steps my this lecture

494
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:40,039
is about sit back don't panic with each

495
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:42,840
step but what's the big picture and the

496
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:47,000
big picture is that you started with a

497
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:48,880
matrix like this so you see it's a it's

498
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,760
a matrix with

499
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:58,240
submatrices so this the rank this this

500
00:27:52,760 --> 00:28:02,559
Matrix W here is the is square and it's

501
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:05,200
full its rank is it's got if if there if

502
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,240
the whole Matrix a has R independent

503
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,360
columns and R independent rows then we

504
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,960
move them into this

505
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:16,760
position

506
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:20,120
W so so I want to start elimination

507
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:23,919
again you'll see I'll get it in one

508
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:26,880
quick line I want to start think about

509
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:30,080
elimination but let me suppose that I'm

510
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:33,279
starting with a matrix like my

511
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,799
example that that has a a square

512
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,320
invertible Matrix there and what does

513
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,240
elimination

514
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,480
do what does el well we know that this

515
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:47,720
is the result so this is what goes in

516
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,039
and this is what goes out just 2 by two

517
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,600
block matrices I call them a block

518
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:55,120
Matrix because these are blocks of

519
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,399
numbers not just single numbers of

520
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,440
course to understand the picture quite

521
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:04,760
good to take just single numbers we

522
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:07,720
might have the numbers 3 7 6 11

523
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:11,159
something like that and what does it

524
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:14,200
reduce to okay and the point is

525
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:15,919
elimination we we have we get the

526
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,200
identity

527
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:22,799
Matrix W goes to the identity

528
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,519
Matrix so elimination is really

529
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,760
inverting finding the inverse of w that

530
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:31,159
that's what elimination is doing

531
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,399
and that was my goal to find out what

532
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:36,080
the heck is elimination doing as I take

533
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:38,720
all these steps it's what it's doing is

534
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,240
it's finding it's it's inverting that

535
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,159
Matrix W but of course it's operating on

536
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,880
whole

537
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:48,240
rows

538
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:51,279
so it it some some the subtractions from

539
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,279
down here leave

540
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,519
zeros and the and the steps up here

541
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,320
multiply the W by its inverse to the the

542
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:05,240
identity this is what we recognize

543
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:08,559
that's the r Matrix after elimination

544
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:12,399
it's got if if there are if there are

545
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:16,440
dependent rows they turn into zero rows

546
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,919
the independent columns turn into start

547
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,840
with the identity after elimination

548
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:23,840
that's the whole point that's the point

549
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,559
of elimination to get from a general

550
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,159
Matrix to that kind of a matrix okay and

551
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:32,519
that's what it does that's the row

552
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,360
reduced Echelon

553
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:38,399
form that that elimination does so

554
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,960
that's really this is the simplest

555
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,840
explanation I could give now you might

556
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,919
say wait a minute this is assuming that

557
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:52,120
W up in that left corner is a nice

558
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:55,440
Square invertible full rank Matrix then

559
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:58,559
then we go here suppose it isn't suppose

560
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,559
I have a zero up in the top left corner

561
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:05,600
or something like that then what what

562
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:10,440
what do I do well I do some row

563
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:14,519
exchanges to get and maybe some column

564
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,919
exchanges to to get to to this W to get

565
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,760
to this

566
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:23,240
invertible uh block pivot you could you

567
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:27,039
could call it which which turns into ey

568
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:31,399
so I have to so the next slide will show

569
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:34,320
you the the possible steps I may have to

570
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:37,399
use some permutation some reordering of

571
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,799
the rows you got to be up for those it

572
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:44,039
can have a reordering of the columns and

573
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,679
that will get it into the position into

574
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:49,919
what we want that gets it into what we

575
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:54,880
want and then elimination gets us where

576
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:58,399
we really want okay so so this is a this

577
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:02,159
is we're at the end now this is the

578
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:06,080
picture of elimination where written in

579
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:08,880
its simplest Matrix form I I do

580
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,919
permutations of rows I reorder the rows

581
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,080
and the columns to get the first columns

582
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,519
and the first rows to be

583
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,639
independent and that that means that

584
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:22,639
they have a r by R Matrix W that's

585
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:26,240
invertible then H and J or whatever they

586
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:28,159
are but then then the next step of

587
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,399
elimination

588
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,200
the two jobs of elimination are get

589
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:36,200
things in the right order and get zeros

590
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,840
produce zeros so here I'm supposing that

591
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:43,279
I get them in the right order there and

592
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:44,960
then I produce the zeros there and also

593
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,919
produce a bunch of zeros in that

594
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,960
identity Matrix and this is the F this

595
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:55,480
is our friend F which we're giving we're

596
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:59,159
shining a light in this lecture on this

597
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:02,320
Matrix F that that got really ignored

598
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:05,320
for a thousand years so there you go I'm

599
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,919
not sure if were through for I I feel

600
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,760
I'm through I've see it says 14 of 16 so

601
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:15,480
there must be some brilliant ideas on

602
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,720
the last last things so interesting

603
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:24,519
point the question is where is that W

604
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:27,200
that Matrix of of um that invertible R

605
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:30,559
byr Matrix that that is the basis for

606
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,480
elimination that W up in the corner and

607
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:36,279
and the theorem is that if I find R

608
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,440
independent rows which there are in the

609
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:41,080
row

610
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:45,320
space if i cho if I find our independent

611
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:48,840
columns so suppose the rows are in a row

612
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:51,559
in a matrix B with r rows the columns

613
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:56,840
are in a matrix c as before with r

614
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:59,960
independent columns then where B meets C

615
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:03,519
can you see this on my so B is coming

616
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:06,279
along as independent rows C is our

617
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:10,480
independent columns and where they

618
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:13,560
meet I claim is an R byr Matrix that's

619
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,040
invertible indep it has independent rows

620
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:21,879
in independent columns so for me this

621
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:25,240
was the real math uh principle that that

622
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:30,359
wasn't so I wasn't so sure about but but

623
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:33,679
it works okay oh oh just to tell you uh

624
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:36,480
that the paper is in a journal called

625
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,639
mathematics magazine it's almost

626
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,800
published as I make this recording uh

627
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,639
it's the mass Association of America and

628
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,399
then there's also a website that has a

629
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,280
lot of math

630
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,599
papers put put in there before

631
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,720
publication and they have some crazy

632
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:02,480
long number to identify them but

633
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:07,079
it's this is the linear algebra textbook

634
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:10,480
that that uses this lecture actually

635
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:12,520
this lecture is not in the textbook it's

636
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,160
uh separate

637
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,240
because

638
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,560
the I didn't want to fill the textbook

639
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:23,119
by this complicated thing

640
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,000
where the idea is

641
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,400
simple where you you simplify your

642
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,079
Matrix a by elimination and then you can

643
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,800
read off all four

644
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:40,760
subspaces and all four fundamental

645
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:43,720
subspaces and the idea is to say what is

646
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,560
elimination actually doing to to put in

647
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:49,680
a little more of the details which are

648
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:52,800
in this talk but not appropriate for uh

649
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:56,359
to necessarily to go into the textbook

650
00:35:52,800 --> 00:36:01,160
so there I there it is

651
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:04,960
um uh the paper that that takes these

652
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:08,920
steps is in a journal that many

653
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:13,359
libraries will uh take well thanks for

654
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:15,680
patience with this uh unusual step I

655
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:19,079
didn't know it was going to happen but

656
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,400
it just I was never happy with with

657
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:25,960
elimination without having a matrix

658
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:30,240
description what happens with the Matrix

659
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,680
pieces of the of my overall Matrix a and

660
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:37,119
that's what this lecture was about so

661
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:40,560
thanks for joining and uh best wishes in

662
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:43,560
linear algebra it's a beautiful subject

663
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,560
thanks
