1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,480
All right. Well, last class we started

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,439
to talk about the forier method in

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,920
uklidian space in R2. And the big goal

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,760
for the class is to to digest the forier

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,400
method, finish that story, but also just

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,240
to digest it in general. Um and then

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,560
after that if there's time we'll start

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,800
to introduce civ theory which has a

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,079
extremely parallel story um that but

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,520
that was developed by a different group

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,600
of people and with with somewhat

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,120
different goals.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,879
Um okay so to digest the 4A method I

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,800
wanted to go back for a second to the

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,879
finite field 4A method where everything

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,280
is a little bit cleaner and to make a

17
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,280
point about it.

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,079
Okay. So,

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,119
so our main lema in the finite field

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:10,320
case was like this. If you have a set of

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:12,640
lines um in FQ2

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,400
[Applause]

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,400
and then you add up their characteristic

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,400
functions

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,439
then it has a a big constant part and

26
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,439
then a small high frequency part.

27
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,759
And then the conclusion is that f is f

28
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,439
plus f high

29
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,720
where um fnot is a constant function.

30
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,240
It's the number of lines over q and from

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,520
that you can compute its l2 norm.

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,200
Um l2 squared is number of lines

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,640
squared.

34
00:01:51,200 --> 00:02:00,520
Um and uh fi is has mean zero and we

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,520
have a bound for its alorm.

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,599
Okay.

37
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,440
So, um, so one thing that you can get

38
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,080
out of this is a bound for the L2 norm

39
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,840
of f. If you add these together, you get

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,520
a bound for the L2 norm of f. Um, and

41
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,879
it's worth saying that that bound for

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,920
the L2 norm of f has a elementary proof

43
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,280
that's really simpler than this. Um, let

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,040
me let me show it for comparison.

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,860
to help put this in perspective.

46
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,860
[Applause]

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,200
Okay.

48
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,200
So let's call this elementary L2 bound.

49
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,920
Okay. So there's a first lema that if

50
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,280
you have two different lines

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,680
and then you take the sum over x

52
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,480
l1 of x l2 of x uh this is at most one

53
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,400
could do that. Uh it's just saying that

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,080
two two lines intersect in at most one

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,560
point.

56
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Okay. And we can use this to make an L2

57
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,080
estimate. So here's the L2 estimate.

58
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:31,680
Um

59
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:34,400
if f is the sum l and l of l of x

60
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:39,440
then

61
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:43,120
f l2 is bounded by the number the number

62
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,360
of lines squared plus number of lines

63
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,560
times q.

64
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,120
Um here's the proof.

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:57,280
So f L2^2

66
00:03:51,120 --> 00:04:01,239
is the sum over L1 and L2 of sum on X L1

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,239
of X L2 of X.

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,920
Okay. And now each one of these sums we

69
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,439
can control with this lema. All right.

70
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,439
But we have to be a little bit careful.

71
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,680
If L1 is equal to L2, that's a different

72
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,439
situation. A line intersects itself in a

73
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,280
lot of points. So we're going to split

74
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,199
up this sum. So it's the sum L1 equals

75
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,880
L2

76
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:28,560
plus the sum L1 did not equal L2.

77
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,280
Okay.

78
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,479
So here we have um only L choices for L1

79
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:41,400
or only L choices appear in this sum and

80
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,400
each one of them contributes Q.

81
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,960
And then over here we have L squar

82
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,759
choices for the lines but each one of

83
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,759
them contributes one.

84
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,520
So that's the

85
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,080
all right so if you compare this with

86
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,320
this it looks something looks kind of

87
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,919
similar right we get an L2 bound up

88
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,440
there of L^2 + LQ that matches L^2 + LQ

89
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,840
that we get here with this quite simple

90
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,479
argument.

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,240
Okay, but the main lema has more

92
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:19,039
information than that. Um,

93
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,880
well, there's actually a really two

94
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:26,000
cases. If Q uh is bigger than the number

95
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,360
of lines, then this term dominates here

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,039
and this term dominates here. And in

97
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,880
that situation, the main lema doesn't

98
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,360
really have much more information than

99
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,320
this because the function fh is not that

100
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,840
special. But the other regime is that

101
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,520
the number of lines is much bigger than

102
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,639
Q. So this dominates that

103
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,800
and in that situation most of the L2

104
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,840
norm is coming from F knot which is very

105
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,120
special because it's constant.

106
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,199
Um so so the um

107
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,199
so the main lema has an important piece

108
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,600
of information beyond this that when we

109
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,759
have many lines this sum is almost

110
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,280
constant and and then it's a constant

111
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,880
plus something that's much smaller.

112
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,639
Okay,

113
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,280
so that uh that is also true in spirit

114
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,479
for the main lema in the real case, but

115
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,840
the main lemon in the real case is a

116
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,680
little bit more complicated. So I wanted

117
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,840
to do this first and then we could look

118
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,479
for the analogous thing in the more

119
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,800
complicated real case.

120
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,120
Okay. So what did the main lema say in

121
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,120
the real case?

122
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,290
[Applause]

123
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:43,039
Main lema in the real case.

124
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,039
So now we have t is a set of 1 by r

125
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,039
rectangles

126
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:55,160
and um uh s t is a smooth approximation

127
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,319
of the characteristic function of t and

128
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,800
the exact meaning of that is explained

129
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:07,039
in agonizing detail on the homework.

130
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,199
Um okay and then we have a function

131
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,039
which is the sum over all the t and t of

132
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,199
this smoothed characteristic function of

133
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,000
t.

134
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,120
Okay. Now our bounds are going to depend

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,720
on how these tubes are clustered.

136
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:29,199
So n subt of r

137
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:32,319
is the maximum where t tilda is a two

138
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:39,080
little r by two big r a rectangle or

139
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:39,080
tube of the number of tubes in there.

140
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:51,800
So picture is we have this tilda and we

141
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,800
see how many middle tubes are in tilda.

142
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,440
Okay so that those are the hypotheses of

143
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,599
the main lema and then the conclusion is

144
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,360
that you can write f uh you can break it

145
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,199
up into pieces of different frequencies.

146
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,960
So the pieces are labeled by a sort of a

147
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,280
width parameter little r which is a

148
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,520
diatic number between scale one and

149
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,160
scale capital r

150
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,400
of f sub little r

151
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,280
where the f sub little r has two good

152
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,919
properties. It has a frequency support.

153
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,560
The support of f little r hat is

154
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:33,200
contained in the ball of radius 1 / r

155
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:39,279
and it has an l2 norm uh bound f sub

156
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:43,039
little r l2 2 is bounded by um the

157
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:47,680
number of tubes times this

158
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:52,640
um packing clustering uh parameter at at

159
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,640
the scale little r um times big r

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,480
Okay.

161
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay. Now, one thing you could take away

162
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,320
from this is you could take away from it

163
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,920
a bound for the L2 norm of F by just

164
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,480
adding up all of these. And like before,

165
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,360
that bound for the L2 norm of F has a

166
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,800
simpler proof. Um, and for context for

167
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,360
understanding this, I'm going to show

168
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,760
you this simpler proof.

169
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:27,040
>> Yes. FR is orthogonal.

170
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:29,519
>> The FRS uh the FRS are orthogonal. Um

171
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,279
yeah, the FRS are orthogonal. Um if we

172
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,880
didn't know they were orthogonal, we

173
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,880
would lose a little bit when we we'd

174
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,000
have to do Koshy Schwarz to compute the

175
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,640
L2 of F. Um but the amount that we would

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,279
lose would be like a log R, which is

177
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,279
relatively minor.

178
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Okay.

179
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,279
Okay. So, let's do an elementary L2

180
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,279
bound.

181
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,480
All right. So, like before we when we

182
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,640
expand out the L2 norm, we'll have to

183
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,600
estimate the integral of one tube times

184
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,120
another tube. Um, but one tube times

185
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,279
another tube is a little bit more

186
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,920
complicated than one line times another

187
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,519
line. Two lines always intersect in a

188
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,839
point, but two tubes intersect in a

189
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,760
different amount of area depending upon

190
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,800
the angle between them. So, we're going

191
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:38,640
to keep track of that.

192
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:44,000
All right. So, let's make a definition.

193
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:49,440
the um width r in between t1 and t2

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,399
is the minimum uh r so that there exists

195
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:58,839
a two r two little r by two big r

196
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,839
rectangle tilda that contains them both.

197
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,360
So if this is t1 and this is t2

198
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,399
then um

199
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,399
that would be t tilda and that would be

200
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,399
r.

201
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,640
Okay.

202
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:34,480
So now

203
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,320
if I want to integrate t1 of x t2 of x

204
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,600
dx

205
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,040
that's going to be about big r over the

206
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,760
little r associated to these two tubes.

207
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,600
Why? Well the integral is the area of

208
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,519
their overlap.

209
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,240
And if I I'll sort of sketch their

210
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,200
overlap over here. Um not a great

211
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,920
picture. Um this is around one because

212
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,200
it's contained in one of the tubes. And

213
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,440
this axis here is uh like big r over

214
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,120
little r.

215
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,519
As little r gets smaller, they overlap

216
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,519
more and more.

217
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:17,480
Okay, good. Um so now we can make it L2

218
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,480
bound.

219
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:26,079
Let's say that the integral of f2

220
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:28,639
bounded by the sum uh sum over little

221
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,959
ratic

222
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:35,600
of

223
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:38,240
t * n subt of little r * big r over

224
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,639
little r.

225
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,279
Okay. And the proof is that we'll just

226
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,519
break up this sum as a bunch of sums

227
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,360
bunch of integrals like this. group them

228
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,639
according to the value of little r and

229
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,560
we'll see what happens. This is what's

230
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:54,320
going to fall out.

231
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:59,040
So here's the proof. Um so the integral

232
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:04,600
of f2 is the sum t1 and t2 in our set of

233
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,600
tubes integral of t1 of x t2x.

234
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,519
Now this integral here depends on the

235
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,880
value of little r. So let's group these

236
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:16,079
by the value of little r. So that's the

237
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:21,920
sum over little ratic

238
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:24,240
sum over t1 and t2 with that value.

239
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,959
So the r associated to t1 and t2 would

240
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,720
be about this r

241
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,920
and then I have this integral which I

242
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,480
can bound by the lema. So I get big r

243
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,480
over little r.

244
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,680
Okay. Now I need to know how many pairs

245
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,320
of tubes are in this list here. Well, I

246
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,480
can choose T1 and T1 as far as I know

247
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,200
could be anything. So I have number of

248
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,200
tubes choices for T1. But once I choose

249
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,839
T1, I choose need to choose another tube

250
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,240
T2 that fits into the same rectangle

251
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,279
with T1. So the number of choices for

252
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,800
that is about N subt R. It's what it's

253
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,680
measured.

254
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:10,399
So this is bounded by sum over r diatic

255
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,360
of um

256
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:19,240
number of tubes

257
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,240
and n subt of r big r over little.

258
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,480
Okay, great.

259
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,560
So let's compare this with this.

260
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,760
This is exactly what we get by just

261
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,959
adding up all those L2 norms uh for the

262
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,880
for the F subr.

263
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,639
Okay.

264
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,680
Um

265
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,760
so this proof is a lot easier than the

266
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,040
proof of the main lama that we did last

267
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:50,360
time. Um let's compare the L2 bound in

268
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,360
the main lama.

269
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,760
[Applause]

270
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,160
If I were to erase this information in

271
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,720
the main lema, then all that would be

272
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,440
left is the L2 bound.

273
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,959
But there is this information and this

274
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,800
is helpful. This is telling us something

275
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,720
more. Um, okay. Now, depending upon what

276
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,680
we know about this thing here, different

277
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,160
terms might dominate this sum.

278
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,199
If it so happens that the term little r

279
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,320
equals 1 uh has the biggest contribution

280
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,079
here um then we don't learn very much

281
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,199
because the our information about the

282
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:28,399
support of f1 hat is is the same as the

283
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,639
information we already had about the

284
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,360
support of fhat. So we'd have nothing

285
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,120
new. uh but it may well happen that the

286
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,639
that the the term where this is biggest

287
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,639
is has little r much larger

288
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,560
and then f little r has this frequency

289
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,560
support condition. It gives it some

290
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,199
structure some extra information there

291
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,199
that's going to help us.

292
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,440
So let's talk about what what does it

293
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,959
mean about the function f little r that

294
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,959
it's frequency is supported there.

295
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,079
Okay. So uh intuition

296
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,759
we call this the the locally constant

297
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,759
intuition

298
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,480
says that if I have some function g and

299
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:44,560
the support of g hat is contained in the

300
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:49,600
ball of radius 1 / r um then

301
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:53,720
the function g is approximately constant

302
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,720
on balls of radius plus.

303
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,000
So

304
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,839
um you know if the support of Ghat is in

305
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,360
the ball of radius 1 / r then ghat is a

306
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,280
combination of waves cosine waves where

307
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,079
all of the cosine waves have have

308
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,520
frequency at most one over r. So each

309
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,240
one of those cosine waves is not

310
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,839
changing very much on balls of radius R.

311
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,000
So it's sort of intuitively plausible

312
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,679
that after we add them up also we'll get

313
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,440
something that is roughly constant on

314
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:33,200
balls of radius R.

315
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,559
We'll come back in a little while and

316
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,559
make a precise statement about this.

317
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:45,960
Okay. So based on this, let me make a

318
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,960
picture illustrating main lama R

319
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,880
main

320
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,880
and then

321
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,400
okay. Um

322
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:07,200
so

323
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:10,000
okay so th this will be well so this

324
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,160
will be like a uh each one of those

325
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,400
lines is going to be a one by R tube.

326
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,960
So, I may have a whole bunch of them

327
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,200
over here, sort of like this. And a

328
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,380
whole bunch of them

329
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,880
over here, sort of like this.

330
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,440
[Applause]

331
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,720
And over over in this part of the board,

332
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,480
I might have some that are not uh so

333
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,960
clumped into thick tubes. It might look

334
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,960
sort of like this.

335
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,480
All right. So over here what the picture

336
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,200
I wanted to to give you is that I put so

337
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,679
many thin strokes of chalk one by our

338
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,600
rectangles that they sort of smooshed on

339
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,160
top of each other and they produced with

340
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,160
like a thick stroke.

341
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:02,880
Um and so this part over here might be

342
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,559
dominated by f of r. So maybe this scale

343
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:10,160
might be R and F subr

344
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:13,160
be sort of the sum of this blob and that

345
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,160
blob

346
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,679
and on the other so this so this over

347
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,080
here in blue would be f subr

348
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,400
and on the other hand this over here

349
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,880
would be f sub f sub one all of this

350
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,880
stuff uh is pretty high frequency

351
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,799
Okay. And notice that this f subar is

352
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,480
kind of roughly constant on any ball of

353
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:49,080
radius r. And so if I were to visualize

354
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,080
the set where f is big.

355
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:02,080
Um well there might be some bits in here

356
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:05,280
where f is big

357
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:10,600
but then there also might be some piece

358
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,600
in here where f is big.

359
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:22,559
Okay. Um so over here this is where f

360
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:26,160
sub1 is big and over here this is where

361
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,160
fub r is big.

362
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,679
All right. And and now the kind of

363
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,000
trade-off that happens is we might have

364
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,640
like a very strong bound for the L2 norm

365
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,280
of F1. And so that bound tells me that

366
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,600
this set where F1 is big is small.

367
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,000
And then we have a bound for the L2 norm

368
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,720
of FR. It might not be such a good

369
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,960
bound. It might be bigger. But on the

370
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,360
other hand, FR has this nice structure

371
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,039
that it is constant on balls. So the set

372
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,679
where FR is big is is group is clumped

373
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:04,559
into these big balls. And so that gives

374
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,120
us so the area might be larger than this

375
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,880
area. But the fact that it's clumped

376
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,159
gives us some other geometric

377
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,159
information about it. It's kind of

378
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,159
simpler.

379
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,320
Okay. So let's pause there. I was uh

380
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,960
recapping the main lema in the real case

381
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,600
and um I sort of tried to have a picture

382
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,600
of what it's telling us.

383
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Okay.

384
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,600
Okay. So the next thing that we should

385
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,799
do is this is sort of nice but it is not

386
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,880
a actual precise math statement. So in

387
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,200
order to really make use of this idea,

388
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,280
we need to now replace this intuition by

389
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,760
by uh an actual precise thing. So let's

390
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,760
let's do that.

391
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,799
So here's a precise

392
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,799
version

393
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,320
of the intuition.

394
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:28,789
[Applause]

395
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,200
Okay. So um

396
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,960
okay. So how do we use

397
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:49,960
the fact that the support of g hat is

398
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,960
contained in something like v of 1 / r.

399
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,840
There's a a

400
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,720
nice trick for for doing this for using

401
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,120
this which goes like this. So suppose I

402
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,400
have a function

403
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:09,520
um ADA

404
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:12,880
so that ADA of C is one for all the C in

405
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,480
the ball of radius 1 / R.

406
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,720
There are many such functions ADA and

407
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,760
and you probably the mo the most useful

408
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,960
kind is to suppose that ADA is also

409
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,960
smooth and compactly supported.

410
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:35,200
Okay. So g hat is equal to g hat * a

411
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,840
ghat is supported on this ball and aa is

412
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,840
one on this ball.

413
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,000
And now I can take the inverse for a

414
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:48,520
transform of this and I get that g is g

415
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,520
convolved with a to check.

416
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:58,559
Okay. Um so this uh follows from and is

417
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,320
almost equivalent to this but it's often

418
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,240
a little bit easier to work with.

419
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,080
So next to work with this we should

420
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:10,360
figure out a little bit uh what this

421
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,360
function a check is like.

422
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,679
So properties of a check.

423
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,919
Okay. So for one thing a check of x is

424
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:31,880
less than

425
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,880
um r the minus2 in the plane

426
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,159
that just follows from the triangle

427
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,760
inequality to compute a check. We

428
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,720
integrate ada times a complex

429
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,440
exponential and ada has size one and

430
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,520
it's supported on this ball.

431
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,840
So we get this

432
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,120
um but in addition to that if if x is

433
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,440
large then we get cancellation so the

434
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,840
next thing is that

435
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,080
aa check of x um decays rapidly so I'll

436
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,360
I'll write something precise in a second

437
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,960
decays rapidly

438
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:10,240
if x is bigger than one and so the

439
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:17,840
reason for that is aa check of x is the

440
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:19,279
integral of c e 2 pi iix xc dx c and um

441
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:23,440
we can bound this integral by

442
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:25,520
integrating by parts um and uh this is a

443
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,200
nice and smooth thing and if x is bigger

444
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,559
than this we integrate by parts many

445
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,400
times we get a strong estimate from this

446
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,600
okay the estimate has the following

447
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,159
shape I start with an r to the minus2

448
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:42,480
just to compare to what I had there and

449
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:47,600
then I have um

450
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,440
uh x over r and I can put here

451
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,799
I can put here any exponent I like but

452
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,799
negative a th000 will be fine for us.

453
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:01,480
So if x is more than teeny bit bigger

454
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,480
than r this thing is very small.

455
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,520
Okay.

456
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,410
[Applause]

457
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
All

458
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:46,000
right.

459
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:50,000
So now let me set um C subR to be the

460
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,320
norm of A check.

461
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And so C subR has bounds that we just

462
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,320
computed.

463
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:04,200
So C subar of X is bounded by R the

464
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,200
minus2 and it's rapidly decaying

465
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:12,320
if X is much bigger than R.

466
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:16,400
Um and now we can state a lema.

467
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:19,919
So if the support of g hat is contained

468
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,320
in the ball of radius 1 / r

469
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:27,440
um then

470
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:33,960
the norm of g of x is bounded by

471
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,960
the norm of g convolved with cr x.

472
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,880
And the proof is is

473
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,679
basically just what just what we what we

474
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:48,640
have. So we we started with G hat is

475
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:52,360
Ghat time ADA and so G is G convolved

476
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,360
with ADA check.

477
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,679
Now take the triangle inequality. The

478
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,159
norm of G is less than or equal to the

479
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,720
norm of G convolved with the norm of A

480
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:08,600
check. And that's the proof. The norm of

481
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,600
A check is called CR.

482
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,120
Okay. And um since we're going to

483
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,360
eventually be thinking about L2 norms,

484
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,520
it is helpful to have a tiny variant of

485
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,000
this lema where we have the norm of G

486
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,600
squar instead of the norm of G. And it's

487
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,360
sort of convenient to prove it ahead of

488
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,600
time instead of in the middle of what's

489
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,600
coming. So uh lambda 2

490
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:46,240
if the support of g hat is contained in

491
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:50,240
the ball of radius 1 / r then the norm

492
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,960
of g ^2 is bounded by the norm of g ^2

493
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,960
convolved with cr.

494
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,679
Okay. So be before we do the the

495
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,279
rigorous proof, let me say something

496
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:10,159
about how I think about this. Um, so

497
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,720
this here says that the norm of G is

498
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,720
bounded by this is sort of like taking

499
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,559
an average. It's like the norm of G is

500
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,880
bounded by the average value of the norm

501
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:22,880
of G on a ball of radius R.

502
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,679
Um

503
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,600
and then if you had that by Koshy

504
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,919
Schwarz you would also have that the

505
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:35,919
norm of G squ was bounded by the average

506
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:37,440
of uh the the norm of G squ on the ball.

507
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:41,919
Okay. So that so that's what we'll write

508
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,640
down now. So the norm of g

509
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:50,240
of x squared

510
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:53,520
is bounded by the first lema by the norm

511
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,520
uh by the norm of g convolved with cr at

512
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,000
x

513
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,000
squared.

514
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:06,080
If I write out what this convolution is,

515
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:12,000
it's the integral norm of g of x - y

516
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:14,799
cr of y d y all squared.

517
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,640
And now I can do a koshy schwarz. Um I

518
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,240
want to do a koshy schwarz to get this

519
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:23,360
guy squared with one of those. So when I

520
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,240
do my koshi schwarz

521
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:32,200
my first factor will be integral norm of

522
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,200
g ^2 x - y cr of y

523
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,960
and my second factor will just be the

524
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,960
integral cr of y dy.

525
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,600
So you could to see that this is a valid

526
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,080
Koshy Schwarz. The sort of total number

527
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,240
of exponents of G is two. Total number

528
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,200
of exponents of C is two. That matches

529
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,880
what's on the other side.

530
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,840
Okay. And now um this thing here is

531
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,159
bounded by one which follows by follows

532
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,240
from our bounds for how it behaves and

533
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,840
which goes along with the intuition that

534
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,440
um you know that this integral is one.

535
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,200
And so this convolution is like doing an

536
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,640
average.

537
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,679
Okay. And this thing here is just the

538
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,840
right hand side. This is G ^2 involved

539
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,840
with VC.

540
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,600
Okay. So this is the way we will

541
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:31,720
rigorously make use of the fact that FR

542
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,720
has frequency in there.

543
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:39,039
Um and it corresponds visually to this

544
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,760
picture that I think I'll erase now

545
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,679
that FR looks sort of like this. And the

546
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,279
places where it's big are consists of

547
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,279
some blobs with balls of radius r.

548
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
[Applause]

549
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,559
Okay.

550
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,519
Um

551
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:03,720
so now we can use our main lama to prove

552
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,720
some projection theory estimates.

553
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:23,080
All right. So our setup

554
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,080
is that we have X is a set of unit balls

555
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,960
in the two-dimensional ball of radius R.

556
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:33,200
D is a set of directions. So it's a

557
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,679
subset of S1, which is 1 / R separated.

558
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,000
and s measures the size of the biggest

559
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,480
projection of x in here. So it's the

560
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,360
maximum over all the thetas in my

561
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,360
direction set of the theta projection of

562
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,360
x.

563
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,880
So that's our setup and we're going to

564
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,799
try to bound these different quantities

565
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,760
in terms of how the directions and how

566
00:32:52,799 --> 00:33:00,159
the spheres are clustered. So remember

567
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:03,840
nx of r is the maximum overall possible

568
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:07,279
center c of the amount of x in the ball

569
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:11,440
of radius c of center c and radius r.

570
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,760
And similarly n subd of row is the

571
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:18,880
maximum

572
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:23,760
over arcs in s1 of length row of the

573
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:27,320
number of directions in the ark.

574
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,320
So that's our setup

575
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:31,120
and the projection theory estimate that

576
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,320
comes from this method I'll call it

577
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:38,919
theorem 2 r theorem 2 in the real case

578
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,919
says that uh if we have the setup

579
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,880
then the number of directions is bounded

580
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,880
I

581
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:04,000
s big R / X times the maximum over

582
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:09,960
little R of um NX of little R and D of

583
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,960
little R over big R over little R 2.

584
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,079
Okay, so this is a little bit messy. Um,

585
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,800
and we'll eventually make some

586
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:22,240
hypotheses that allow to simplify it.

587
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,399
Um, but just notice for now that this

588
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,320
estimate takes account of how the set of

589
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,399
directions is clustered and it takes

590
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,200
account of how sorry it takes account of

591
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,800
how the set x of unit balls is clustered

592
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,440
and it takes account of how the set of

593
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,440
directions is clustered.

594
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,879
Okay, so the proof uh follows the uh

595
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,720
idea of the proof we did in finite

596
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:49,200
fields and and makes use of the main

597
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,919
lema. And here's our setup. So for every

598
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:56,800
direction in our direction set, let's

599
00:34:51,919 --> 00:35:01,920
say t theta is a set of at most s we

600
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:05,640
could say exactly s one by r tubes t

601
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,640
that cover s.

602
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,599
So if this projection has size s then

603
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,560
looking at the fibers of the projections

604
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:20,079
I get s tubes that cover my set x.

605
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,599
Okay. Then um t my master set of tubes

606
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:26,000
will be the union over all the

607
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:28,560
directions t theta and f is going to be

608
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,680
the sum over all these tubes of the

609
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,680
smoothed approx uh smoothed um

610
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:40,160
characteristic function of the tube.

611
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,800
Okay. So we observe that for every x in

612
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,440
x um

613
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,440
f ofx is at least the number of

614
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,440
directions.

615
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,960
All right.

616
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:05,599
So now we now we use our main lama and

617
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:09,240
we break up f into these different frs.

618
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,240
use main lema.

619
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,440
Um, and I there are only logarithmically

620
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,119
many different choices of R. And so one

621
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,359
of them has to make a pretty big

622
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:23,720
contribution at each of these points.

623
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,720
And so I can I can choose R.

624
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,760
So that all right. So so I have X * D^2

625
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,920
that's smaller than the integral X of

626
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,720
F2.

627
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,359
And now there are only a few Rs. So that

628
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:45,720
should be somewhat smaller than a like a

629
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:45,720
log times the integral over X of R 2.

630
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,780
Okay.

631
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,780
[Applause]

632
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,359
Now the first thing I might try here is

633
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,280
if if you look at the statement of the

634
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,839
main lama it has an upper bound for the

635
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,359
L2 norm of FR and I could plug in that

636
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:17,320
that upper bound and I would bound this

637
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,320
I would get something out of it

638
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,320
but that's not the optimal thing to do

639
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,920
here. Um dep well depending on what we

640
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,560
know about X depending on what we know

641
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,760
about this. So to get some intuition,

642
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,030
let's look at this picture that I

643
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,149
haven't managed to erase yet.

644
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:35,149
[Applause]

645
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:42,480
So we're trying to understand this

646
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:46,000
thing, the integral overx of fr 2. So

647
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:49,560
let's add an x to our picture. Uh do I

648
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,560
have any more colors?

649
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,280
So x in this picture is going to be

650
00:37:53,040 --> 00:38:00,440
yellow.

651
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,440
And x may look something like this

652
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,280
depends a little bit on nx of r. If nx

653
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,160
of r the biggest that nx of r could be

654
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,440
is r 2. If it's that big then x could

655
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,440
fill in this whole thing. But if nx of r

656
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,960
is smaller than r^ 2 then it's sort of

657
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,640
like the picture that I drew when x is

658
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,359
only a small fraction of this ball.

659
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,480
And in this picture it would be lossy to

660
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:35,440
estimate the integral over just x of fr

661
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:39,160
2 by the global integral of fr which

662
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,160
would include the whole orteal.

663
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:47,680
Okay. Um so we're going to try to do a

664
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:51,440
bit better than that by using our lemas.

665
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:55,720
uh about the about the locally constant

666
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,720
property of the function fr.

667
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,119
All right. So I'm going to erase this

668
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,520
but I'm going to leave this picture here

669
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,520
for our intuition.

670
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:14,079
All right. So we have the integral overx

671
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,040
of fr 2 that is I'll just rewrite it as

672
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,040
the integral of 1x

673
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,040
fr.

674
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,599
Okay. Now if I want to use the locally

675
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,079
constant property of fr 2 it means I

676
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,760
should I could use these lemas and in

677
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,599
particular I can use lema 2 which is

678
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,400
sort of well set up to deal with a

679
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:38,079
square. So this is bounded by the

680
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:44,760
integral of 1x *

681
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,760
fr 2 convolved with uh cr

682
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,839
and um if you write out what this is and

683
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:57,680
do fubini this is the same as the

684
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:59,680
integral of fr 2 times the

685
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,240
characteristic function of x involved

686
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,240
with E R

687
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,440
does that step something you see that

688
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:18,000
yeah okay let's do it so the algebra is

689
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:20,079
like this I have the integral 1x of x

690
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:30,280
and then I have this convolution which

691
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:30,280
is the integral fr of x - y cr of y d y

692
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,200
No, let me do it the other way.

693
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,760
Okay. So now what happens if I fubini

694
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,040
that

695
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:56,480
um that's the integral

696
00:40:51,040 --> 00:41:04,200
fr of y integral of 1

697
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:04,200
x of x c of x - y dy

698
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,240
okay it doesn't look quite right yet and

699
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,520
it actually reminds me that there's a

700
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,520
little something else that's helpful to

701
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:19,119
say about cr Um

702
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:24,319
uh so you can also add here that CR is

703
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:25,680
radial. It implies that it's symmetric.

704
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,839
Yeah, I should probably have mentioned

705
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,599
that earlier in my plan. Uh so the

706
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,520
reason you can do that remember CR was

707
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,599
the 4A transform of some bump function

708
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,119
ADA. If your bump function ADA is

709
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,680
radial, it for a transform will be

710
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,319
radial. So so this guy is radial and

711
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,000
symmetric. Okay. And then because that's

712
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:44,720
symmetric,

713
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:50,880
I can switch those. So that's the

714
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:57,160
integral fr of y integral 1x of x c of y

715
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,160
- x uh sorry this one is this one is dx.

716
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:09,640
Uh so that's the integral of r of y 1x

717
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,640
involved with cr of y.

718
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,319
I feel like there also should be a nice

719
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,920
image of what's going on in this

720
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,400
integral.

721
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,839
um like we have this imagine for a

722
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,280
second that this was the characteristic

723
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,599
function of a set. It's not quite true,

724
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,400
but it's not far off either. So I have

725
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,560
one set and I have another set.

726
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,560
But before I multiply them together,

727
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,839
which would mean intersecting the sets,

728
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,480
I fatten out this set here by a distance

729
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:57,200
r. So I take this this call this set y.

730
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,520
I take y, I fatten it out by r, and I

731
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,200
intersect it with x.

732
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,040
And that's kind of the same thing as

733
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,359
taking X and fattening it out by R and

734
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,640
intersecting it with Y because I could

735
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,240
describe both of them like this. I'm

736
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,160
looking for pairs of points, one in X

737
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,400
and one in Y. The distance between them

738
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,480
is at most R. If I say it that way, it's

739
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,920
symmetric.

740
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,920
And and that's what's going on here.

741
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,200
I guess that's a fancy way of saying I

742
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,119
just took this integral and I wrote it

743
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,839
like this.

744
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,240
And now remember that the function CR is

745
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:35,280
symmetric. Now the whole thing is

746
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,680
symmetric symmetric in in exchanging

747
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,680
these two functions.

748
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,079
Okay, cool.

749
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:47,119
Okay, so now we've written it this way

750
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,960
and the intuitive meaning of this is

751
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:53,760
I've averaged the characteristic

752
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:59,520
function of X over balls of radius R.

753
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:04,319
Um and so uh this is bounded by

754
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:07,920
nx of r / r 2. So this is the integral

755
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:09,520
of that guy over a ball of radius r

756
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,280
and then I'm picking the average. So I

757
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,760
divide by the area of the ball of radius

758
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,480
r.

759
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,280
Okay.

760
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,680
Um so to check this a little bit more

761
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,319
carefully we have to use the bounds that

762
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:27,319
we have for this CR thing which are over

763
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,319
here.

764
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,760
So it's bounded by 1 / r^ 2 on the ball

765
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,680
of radius r that would give the average.

766
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,680
Then it also has this rapidly decaying

767
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,839
tail which to be careful we should take

768
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,440
account of. Um but what what it

769
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:47,240
contributes is is uh is smaller than the

770
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,240
first term the main term.

771
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,839
Okay. So that's how we bound this. This

772
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,599
is now a number. So we can take it out

773
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:58,079
of the integral and we just have left

774
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,040
the L2 norm of fr 2. So we plug in our

775
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:05,040
bound for that. So we have it's bounded

776
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:08,560
by nx of r / r 2. You can think of this

777
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:11,760
thing as the density of x at scale r

778
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:15,200
times the integral of f_sub_r 2. Okay.

779
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,520
And then I just plug in the the bound

780
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:21,200
for the integral of fr 2. And we'll

781
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:24,640
write that out. So um okay, we have

782
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:30,000
number of tubes. We have big r over

783
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:34,240
little r. We have nt of r. That's this

784
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:38,359
thing. Then we have n x of r

785
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,359
and then we have r square.

786
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:50,079
Okay, we are almost done. Um but what

787
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:53,280
what we have here is number of tubes in

788
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,040
a little r by big r guy and the

789
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,960
information we want to be using is the

790
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:01,200
number of directions.

791
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:03,760
So the last step is that the number of

792
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,560
tubes in a little r by big r tube is

793
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,680
bounded by the number of directions in a

794
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:13,040
little r over big r uh angle times

795
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,720
little r. So here's a picture.

796
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:20,720
Here's our um little r by big r tube.

797
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:23,359
Inside of it, I can fit in some tubes in

798
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:26,319
different directions. So if I pick one

799
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:29,119
direction, I can pick little r of them.

800
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:32,240
Um, that's this little r. But they don't

801
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,720
have to go that way. I could also have

802
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,319
them go may maybe the most extreme

803
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,280
direction is I could have them go that

804
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:44,560
way.

805
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:50,319
And this angle here is uh little r. The

806
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:52,240
angle there is little r big.

807
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:55,920
So all of the different tubes that

808
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:58,000
appear here um there are they have to

809
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,920
have an angle in a within a range of

810
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,560
little r over big r. So the number of

811
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,160
directions is like that. And then for

812
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,680
each direction then the number of

813
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:10,720
possible tubes is at most little r.

814
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,720
Okay. So if you substitute this for that

815
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,839
um then this expression becomes the

816
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,839
right hand side of the two.

817
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,520
Yeah.

818
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,599
>> Are you able to kind of use the fact

819
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:40,319
that the tubes that are at an angle like

820
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:42,720
you can fit less of them in? Does that

821
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,760
change the bound or do anything

822
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,680
different?

823
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:50,720
>> Yeah. Okay. So the question was um if we

824
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:54,240
knew that in a given direction these

825
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,920
tubes um were had to have some spacing.

826
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,520
So we could so we could also measure the

827
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,440
clustering of the tubes in a given

828
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,520
direction. So if we add some information

829
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,400
about that then maybe this would have to

830
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:07,040
be smaller than little r.

831
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,880
So in our setup

832
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,640
so our setup involves three things but

833
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,359
we only thought about the clustering of

834
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,079
two of them. Our setup involves set of

835
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:19,920
unit balls X and we looked at how it's

836
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,599
clustered NX of R set of directions D

837
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,520
and we looked at how it's clustered ND

838
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:27,440
of row and also a set of projections

839
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,640
which each have size at most S but we

840
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,240
didn't say anything about how they were

841
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,240
clustered.

842
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,280
So you could add to this setup something

843
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:38,720
about how each projection is clustered

844
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:41,280
and you could then use that to improve

845
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,880
this thing here.

846
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,319
Yeah. So, that could be a little

847
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,720
homework project if anyone is interested

848
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,720
in doing it.

849
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:56,839
Yeah.

850
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,839
Good. Any other questions or comments?

851
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,800
Okay.

852
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,800
Um Okay. So one uh so this the theorem

853
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:12,559
sort of naturally falls out from using

854
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:15,520
the fora method um but it's a little

855
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,800
messy looking and the the the thing

856
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,640
that's particularly messy looking is

857
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,480
this maximum over little rx and d and

858
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,319
there's a a fairly general situation

859
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:28,000
that we mentioned last time where that

860
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:28,960
that messy bit gets a lot cleaner. Um, I

861
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,720
don't know that that's so

862
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,920
philosophically important, but it's I

863
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,839
think it's worth mentioning and that

864
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,480
this is the way this the results usually

865
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,480
appear in the literature.

866
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,160
All right.

867
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,559
And and this will allow us to to you

868
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:52,200
know finally prove the result that we

869
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,200
stated last time.

870
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:10,720
All right. So um so definition we say x

871
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:14,440
is housedorf

872
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,440
or housedorf spacing

873
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:23,920
if nx of r to the beta is bounded by

874
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:27,440
around x to the beta for all beta

875
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:31,119
between zero and one.

876
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,720
So when beta is one this is trivial. Um

877
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,200
this is always true but this is saying

878
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,839
that at at smaller scales beta this x is

879
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:41,440
not too clumped compared to how it is at

880
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:45,800
the uh the top scale. Yeah.

881
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,800
>> How does the appear there?

882
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,599
>> Ah sorry thanks. There was one uh yeah

883
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:58,880
there was one other thing I forgot to

884
00:50:53,599 --> 00:51:01,200
do. Um okay sorry thanks. So, okay. So,

885
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,960
the question is um how did we actually

886
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,400
do all this algebra and get the equation

887
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,640
that the inequality that's actually

888
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,000
stated in theorem 2 and thank you for

889
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,800
the question because I left out some of

890
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,760
the steps.

891
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,760
Okay. Um

892
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,280
so now that we have done the main ideas

893
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,839
we're just talking about the algebra I

894
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,839
will erase this

895
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,839
and um so what do we have so far? If you

896
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,319
put together the inequalities we have so

897
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:32,079
far, we have x times the number of

898
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:34,000
directions squared. That's where we

899
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:37,760
started over here. Then we did some

900
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:41,599
stuff and we ended up here. So that's

901
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:43,680
bounded by number of tubes time big r

902
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,920
over little r

903
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,800
um times

904
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:53,280
um

905
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:55,520
md little r over big r * r. That was

906
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:59,520
this thing for there.

907
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:02,640
n x of r over little r 2 and we can

908
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:04,800
cross those guys.

909
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,680
Now we still have this number of tubes.

910
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:11,040
What's that? Well, we have s tubes in

911
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:14,880
each direction. We have d directions.

912
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:17,040
So this is s * d.

913
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,200
Okay. So now I've gotten rid of all the

914
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,960
extra letters and we only have left the

915
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,440
letters that appear in the inequality we

916
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:27,319
want. And then the last thing you do is

917
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,319
you get D by itself.

918
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,640
So I take one factor of D and bring it

919
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,119
over there and cancel the two. And I'll

920
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:39,880
take the X and bring it over here. And

921
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,880
then what's what's left is what's there?

922
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,079
>> Yeah. Can that inequality be made shown

923
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,000
in any scenario

924
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:53,480
like

925
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,480
any choice of like s x?

926
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,319
Um yeah.

927
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:08,079
Yes. Okay. So, so the question is is

928
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,160
this inequality ever sharp? And uh it is

929
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:14,319
uh sometimes sharp although not super

930
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:16,640
often. And um and the cases that I have

931
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:19,440
worked out so far when it's sharp are

932
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,880
within this houseorf setting. So let's

933
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,400
maybe do that. It'll all get a lot

934
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:26,119
simpler and then I can say what the

935
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,119
cases I know are.

936
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:33,680
Okay. So the house spacing is uh bound

937
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,559
on nx of of little r in terms of the

938
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,720
size of x that looks like this. And I I

939
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,319
coined the term housedorf spacing

940
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,760
because it sort of comes up naturally

941
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:44,319
when you talk about housedorf measures

942
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:46,880
and things like that.

943
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,640
Okay. And it's useful in our setting

944
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:54,599
because

945
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:54,599
if X and D have housed dorf spacing,

946
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:03,520
then when you take the maximum

947
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:08,200
of actually many expressions, but the

948
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,200
one that comes up for us here is this.

949
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,800
Okay, what happens? So, so I assume that

950
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,040
both X and D have housed dorf spacing.

951
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,960
It's important to have both of them.

952
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:24,559
Then each one of these things get

953
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:28,160
replaced by some power of X or D.

954
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:31,280
And um once you have a power law, so the

955
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,440
whole the whole expression will be um

956
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,800
will be uh or another way to look at is

957
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,440
the whole expression will be some power

958
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,760
of little r. Power could be positive or

959
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:43,119
negative. the maximum will occur either

960
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:46,240
at one or at big r.

961
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:49,280
So this guy basically is equal to what

962
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:52,480
happens at one. Uh nx of one is always

963
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:55,440
one. Nd of 1 / r is always one. So we

964
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:59,599
just get one. And when little r is big

965
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:02,319
r, nx of big r is all the points. Nd of

966
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:05,319
one is all the directions. And we have

967
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:05,319
that.

968
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,839
So it's less nasty. And so we get the

969
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:15,920
following corlary.

970
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:21,160
So correlary says if we have our setup

971
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,160
and X and D have high direct spacing

972
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:30,400
then the number of directions is bounded

973
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,640
by

974
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:41,520
uh

975
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:47,640
S SR overX * 1 plus SRX * this thing. So

976
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:47,640
s d uh over r.

977
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,359
Okay. Now this one has an

978
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:55,599
interpretation. If this term dominates,

979
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:58,240
you can cancel the d's and it tells you

980
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:01,440
that s is almost r.

981
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,520
So we get either

982
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,839
s is almost as big as r. r is the

983
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:08,960
biggest it could possibly be. So s is

984
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:15,040
almost as big as it could possibly be

985
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:17,680
or d is bounded by srx.

986
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:19,680
So that's what we stated last time. The

987
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:21,920
formula is not as nasty as the general

988
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,799
formula.

989
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:28,319
>> Yeah.

990
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:30,720
>> There's also a factor of log in the two.

991
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:33,800
>> Yep. Thanks.

992
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,800
[Applause]

993
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,200
So the point from the audience was that

994
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:41,280
I I there was an extra factor of logar

995
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:46,520
that I forgot to write down. So I'll put

996
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,520
this to represent that. Yeah. Thanks.

997
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:54,160
Okay. So this relatively clean estimate,

998
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,720
it exactly matches our theorem to

999
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,319
infinite fields. Um I won't write it

1000
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,599
down, but the the numerology is the

1001
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:04,160
same. Um and it it's a little nicer to

1002
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:08,480
look at. It still takes some digesting

1003
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:11,040
and um this is sharp in some cases. Um

1004
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:14,400
it's sharp in the case that s is pretty

1005
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,839
close to r. So because I I need this the

1006
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,960
smallest I could make s would be

1007
00:57:15,839 --> 00:57:23,280
something like r / log r and if you take

1008
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:25,359
s around that r log r 1 - epsilon then

1009
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:30,359
this is sharp in the example of a grid

1010
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:30,359
of points grid of unit balls.

1011
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,640
Yeah. So that's the main interesting

1012
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,200
example when it that is the main example

1013
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:39,040
that I know when it's when it's sharp

1014
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,119
and there are plenty of examples where

1015
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:43,520
it's not sharp but that great example is

1016
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,839
is important.

1017
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:47,920
Yeah. Um okay I guess it's also a

1018
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:49,920
natural question if we go to the regime

1019
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:54,079
that's not housedorf.

1020
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:56,960
um this theorem added some

1021
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:59,200
junk here to account for for this for

1022
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,760
things being more clustered and it's a

1023
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:05,520
natural question is there any scenario

1024
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:07,040
where this junk is is exactly sharp um

1025
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,640
and I wondered about that when I was

1026
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,559
working on this lecture but I don't know

1027
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:14,920
the answer yet so if anybody wants to

1028
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,920
try that's also a nice little project.

1029
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:27,839
Cool.

1030
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:30,799
Okay. So, that was the meat of the class

1031
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:32,799
and that was the the the the thing that

1032
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,880
um you know

1033
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:37,440
my my my discussion that I planned about

1034
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:40,480
the 4A method in the real case. So, it's

1035
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,119
another good moment to um see if see if

1036
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,240
you have questions to digest

1037
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:47,240
and we'll start something a little

1038
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:47,240
different.

1039
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:58,559
>> Yeah. Um for the the maximum term, could

1040
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:01,760
you explain why only like it has to be a

1041
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:04,000
maximum and it's like the part of the

1042
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:08,240
proof that requires taking maximum over

1043
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:11,119
R instead of any given R.

1044
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,280
>> Um so I think the question is why do we

1045
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:14,720
have a maximum over R instead of maybe

1046
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,079
like a sum over R?

1047
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,640
>> Yeah.

1048
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,559
>> Yeah.

1049
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:22,720
>> Where does maximum come from?

1050
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:24,960
>> Yeah. Um so you you could put sum over

1051
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,640
little r and the difference isn't very

1052
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,359
important because the number of terms is

1053
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,359
only log of r and the log of r is is got

1054
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:34,720
absorbed here. But where did this come

1055
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:36,240
from at all? Well, we had this um

1056
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,160
function that's the sum of all these

1057
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:42,319
tubes which describes our projection

1058
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:44,079
situation. And then we are the key thing

1059
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:45,839
is that we applied the main lema to this

1060
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:48,799
function. And the main lema said you

1061
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:49,200
could break up this function into a few.

1062
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:52,079
Yeah.

1063
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,760
>> Yeah. And so one of those pieces is sort

1064
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:57,640
of the important one and that's the one

1065
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,640
that appears in the maximum.

1066
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,880
>> Yeah. Yeah.

1067
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,160
>> Wondering. So in the proof we have to

1068
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:12,319
keep track of all the Rs.

1069
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:15,440
Um in the hos spacing case it seems like

1070
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:17,359
we just there's only two cases. So I'm

1071
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:20,480
wondering if if you do have positive

1072
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:23,359
spacing is it really necessary? Is it

1073
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:25,280
still important to do the static

1074
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:27,920
division?

1075
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,160
>> Okay. So the question is in the house

1076
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,319
dorf spacing case it turned out at the

1077
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,240
end of the day that only two values of

1078
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:38,559
little r mattered in the final

1079
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:40,799
inequality namely one and capital r and

1080
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:42,720
the question was would it be possible to

1081
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:45,280
write the proof so that only those two

1082
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,680
appeared and we didn't have all this you

1083
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,040
know rather complicated business of

1084
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:52,160
keeping track of all the intermediate

1085
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:54,880
little rs. Um I don't know any way to do

1086
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,400
that. I I think the only way I

1087
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,000
understand it is to keep track of all

1088
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:03,359
the little Rs and then notice that under

1089
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:07,799
these hypotheses, the intermediate Rs uh

1090
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,799
are bounded by the extreme ones.

1091
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,720
Okay.

1092
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:20,000
Okay. So, I thought I would say a a

1093
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:22,000
little bit about the history of these

1094
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,040
ideas. I did haven't been putting names

1095
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,920
next to the theorems and the reason is

1096
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:30,160
that these theorems are small variations

1097
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,319
of theorems from the literature and

1098
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:34,160
there are many kind of related theorems

1099
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:35,200
from the literature but so but but let

1100
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,480
me tell you a little bit about the

1101
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,240
history I think it's interesting I think

1102
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,880
these are kind of fundamental ideas and

1103
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,240
they were discovered uh independently or

1104
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,200
somewhat independently by different

1105
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:48,200
people working on different problems

1106
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,200
Um

1107
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,480
so the thing that we have been calling

1108
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:04,359
the forier method.

1109
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,359
So let's call this history.

1110
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,880
The thing that we are calling the forier

1111
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:13,280
method appears in a bunch places

1112
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:16,319
including the following. Um the earliest

1113
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:19,319
that I am aware of is Linux work in civ

1114
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:19,319
theory

1115
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:24,640
which I will introduce civ theory and

1116
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:28,720
tell you what this work was uh in the

1117
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:30,799
today. So that was in the 1940s.

1118
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:35,280
uh a second place the second place I'm

1119
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:38,000
aware of is Roth's work on the Hybrron

1120
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,280
triangle problem

1121
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,720
which at some point in the class

1122
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:45,119
probably we'll talk about a little bit

1123
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:48,400
in the 70s.

1124
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:49,920
Um Roth was uh he he he knew civ theory

1125
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,000
he knew Linux work well and he'd worked

1126
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,520
on it but in in this problem he did

1127
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,280
something similar that's in uklidian

1128
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:58,480
space and the setup is kind of different

1129
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:00,160
and any so I put it on the list then it

1130
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:05,319
was something like this was done by

1131
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:05,319
falconer in geometric measure theory

1132
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:14,240
so falconer essentially proved um uh the

1133
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:16,720
correlary that I just erosed and that

1134
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:20,160
was around 1980.

1135
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:22,319
Um, and then it was done by Van in the

1136
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:25,319
setting of finite fields. So, lines in

1137
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:25,319
FQ2

1138
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,079
and I'm not positive about this, but I

1139
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:36,400
think that many of these people were not

1140
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:39,760
fully aware of others of these people.

1141
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:43,160
Okay. Um, we also mentioned the double

1142
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,160
counting method.

1143
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,359
and the double counting method um that

1144
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,359
that we did. So is it was done by

1145
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:57,280
Calfman

1146
01:03:55,359 --> 01:04:00,280
in the context of geometric measure

1147
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,280
theory

1148
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:09,680
in the 1960s.

1149
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:13,119
Um and it was done by Gallagher

1150
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:15,920
in the context of civ theory

1151
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:17,359
I think also in the 1960s.

1152
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,640
I'm pretty sure that these two people

1153
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:20,559
did not know what the other one was

1154
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,400
doing.

1155
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:24,079
Um, and I guess it was probably also

1156
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,079
done in the setting of lines and finite

1157
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:27,760
fields in the 60s or 70s, but I don't

1158
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,720
know. I don't quite have I don't have a

1159
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,160
reference.

1160
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,720
And those people probably didn't know

1161
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,720
about either of these.

1162
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,240
Okay.

1163
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:42,400
Um, so now let me tell you what civ

1164
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:45,850
theory is and how it is analogous to

1165
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:53,019
what we have been doing.

1166
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:53,019
[Applause]

1167
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Okay.

1168
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:20,960
So cif theory takes place over the

1169
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,319
integers and the main character in civ

1170
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:25,119
theory is taking the integers and

1171
01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:26,880
reducing it modulo q for different bases

1172
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,200
q

1173
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,319
um okay so z of course is the integers

1174
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:35,359
I'm going to write zq for some people

1175
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:38,240
write z mod qz this is the the integers

1176
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:42,319
modulo q

1177
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:44,799
and there's a basic map pi subq z 2 Z

1178
01:05:42,319 --> 01:05:48,440
cub which takes an integer and reduces

1179
01:05:44,799 --> 01:05:48,440
it modulo Q.

1180
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:56,640
Okay, this map is going to play the role

1181
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:58,559
of our projections. So let me mention

1182
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,640
what is analogous.

1183
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,520
So we've been talking about maps pi

1184
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:08,079
theta that go from R2 to R or a

1185
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:10,880
one-dimensional subspace or from FQ2 to

1186
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:12,640
FQ.

1187
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:16,799
Um, and now we're talking about the map

1188
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:18,799
pi Q that goes from Z to Z mod Q. Um,

1189
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:22,000
what do all these things have in common?

1190
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:25,400
They are all group homorphisms between a

1191
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,400
billion groups.

1192
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:39,400
Okay. Um

1193
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,680
so

1194
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,280
so what we're going to do in civ theory

1195
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:50,079
is take a take a set which is going to

1196
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:52,240
be now a set of integers and think about

1197
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:54,559
all the different projections of its

1198
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,839
integer of the set and think about how

1199
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,280
they're all related to each other and

1200
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:58,799
how they're all related to the original

1201
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,319
set.

1202
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:02,480
Um so I have another little piece of

1203
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:05,359
notation. So this thing is the numbers

1204
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:07,039
from one up to n which is a subset of

1205
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:09,680
the integers.

1206
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,839
Um and let me illustrate projection

1207
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:14,240
theory. Let me illustrate civ theory

1208
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:16,000
with an interesting example of a set

1209
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:19,240
whose projections behave in kind of a

1210
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,240
funny way.

1211
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:25,619
[Music]

1212
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:48,240
Okay. So do an example.

1213
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,640
Our example is going to be basically the

1214
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,440
set of square numbers. It's going to be

1215
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:56,720
the set of little n^ squ where little n

1216
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:59,599
goes from one up to big n to the 1/2. So

1217
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:03,200
it's a subset of the integers from 1 to

1218
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:05,839
n and the cardality is about the square

1219
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:08,480
root of n.

1220
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:11,280
What happens when I reduce this set

1221
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:14,960
modulo p?

1222
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:18,159
Um so if p is prime

1223
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:20,480
when I take pi p of x I get the

1224
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:23,679
quadratic residues and the number of

1225
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:26,319
quadratic residues is p + 1 over two. So

1226
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,920
about half of that.

1227
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,440
So that's kind of an interesting and

1228
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:33,440
surprising fact. Um, of course if P is

1229
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,960
bigger than square root of N, obviously

1230
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,839
the size of this projection is smaller

1231
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:39,679
than X. Um, so I might not even hit all

1232
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:42,880
the quadratic residues if I take a big

1233
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:44,640
P. Uh, that's not surprising. But I

1234
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,719
could take P significantly less than the

1235
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:50,000
square root of N.

1236
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:52,960
And then um I when I do this projection

1237
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:56,239
I only hit half of the elements in Z my

1238
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:58,319
P and I hit each of those many times.

1239
01:08:56,239 --> 01:09:00,000
That's you know it's not something

1240
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:02,400
that's likely to happen randomly. It's

1241
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,080
kind of striking.

1242
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:09,520
So one sample question from civ theory

1243
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:12,239
is um uh

1244
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:15,120
how big could a set X be and have all of

1245
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:18,319
its projections be small like this?

1246
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:22,080
And uh what examples are there? How many

1247
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:26,000
sets like this can you find?

1248
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:27,359
All right. Um so using the using his

1249
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,799
ideas about civ theory, one of the

1250
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,440
things that Linick did was to answer

1251
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:34,480
this answer some of this question. So

1252
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:38,239
theorem of lin

1253
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:41,600
in the 1940s uh it says um if I have a

1254
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:46,719
subset of the integers from 1 to n and

1255
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:49,600
if pi p of x is at most p + 1 / 2 for

1256
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:50,960
every p. Um so there's nothing so

1257
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,560
special about this. We could put other

1258
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,719
things here but I'm just using this to

1259
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:58,640
compare with the squares.

1260
01:09:54,719 --> 01:10:03,560
Um then the conclusion is that the size

1261
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:03,560
of x is at most around n^ the 1/2.

1262
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:09,199
So it says that the square numbers are

1263
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:12,199
just about the biggest set with this

1264
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:12,199
property.

1265
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,480
Cool. So we will give two proofs of

1266
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,840
this. We'll give a proof using double

1267
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,640
counting and we'll give a proof using

1268
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,640
the 4A method.

1269
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,560
Um

1270
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,560
there are lots of hard open problems in

1271
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,760
civ theory and one of them is to

1272
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:35,640
understand uh what the examples are. So

1273
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,640
the only known examples

1274
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:43,920
only known examples

1275
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,920
where where this theorem is roughly

1276
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,920
tight

1277
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:52,840
are the square numbers and close

1278
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,840
cousins.

1279
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:06,880
So sorry it's messy the square numbers

1280
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:09,600
and close cousins of the square numbers

1281
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:12,239
like you can you could replace this with

1282
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,920
another degree 2 polinomial in little n

1283
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,440
and it's not hard to see it's it's kind

1284
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,440
of equivalent and those are all the

1285
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:18,440
examples

1286
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:27,239
okay but people know basically nothing

1287
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:27,239
in about classifying the examples.

1288
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:31,400
Cool.

1289
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,640
Okay.

1290
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:40,239
So, um, so we'll give two proofs of

1291
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,920
this. One based on double counting and

1292
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:43,760
one based on the 4A method. Double

1293
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,800
counting I think we can do today and the

1294
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:50,000
4A method we'll do next time, next week.

1295
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:52,320
And first of all, I think that these

1296
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,840
results are pretty cool. But I also hope

1297
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:56,080
that you see that they're really

1298
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,679
extremely parallel to the results in

1299
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,840
geometric measure theory that we've just

1300
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,840
been talking.

1301
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,360
Okay.

1302
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:10,960
[Applause]

1303
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:31,600
Okay, let me make a little remark before

1304
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:34,560
we start. Um, so, so I'm going to focus

1305
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:36,880
on projections mod p where p is a prime.

1306
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:39,600
You could also reduce mod q where q is

1307
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:41,760
not a prime. And all of the ideas still

1308
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,320
work. It's a little bit more complicated

1309
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,800
because if you take two numbers Q1 and

1310
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:49,199
Q2 that share a common factor, then

1311
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,120
reducing mod Q1 and reducing mod Q2 are

1312
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:52,239
kind of related to each other. And so if

1313
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:54,080
you write everything down, you have to

1314
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:56,239
keep track of that. That's just an extra

1315
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:58,960
thing to keep track of. And not so

1316
01:12:56,239 --> 01:13:00,239
difficult, but it it uh it makes

1317
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,080
everything a little longer and more

1318
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:04,080
complicated. Sometimes you might want to

1319
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,360
do that, but uh in applications, but

1320
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:09,360
just to show the ideas, I'm going to

1321
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:12,360
focus on my P.

1322
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,360
Okay.

1323
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:38,040
All right. So, here's the double

1324
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,040
counting method.

1325
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:49,760
U so I'll call it theorem 1 s.

1326
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:54,400
Um so it says if x is a subset of the

1327
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:57,400
numbers from 1 to n and d is a set of

1328
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,400
primes

1329
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:04,120
uh less than or equal to n.

1330
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,120
Um

1331
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:13,199
and for every p in our set of primes, pi

1332
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:18,679
subp of x is less than equal to s. Um

1333
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:18,679
then we get a conclusion. Um

1334
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:26,480
either

1335
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:31,400
x is bounded by 2s or the number of

1336
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:31,400
directions is bounded roughly by us.

1337
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,080
So I guess this is most interesting if

1338
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,719
the number of directions is

1339
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:43,760
significantly bigger than s.

1340
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:45,920
So if we look at the squares

1341
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:51,600
uh so suppose I know that pi p of x is

1342
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:56,560
bounded by uh p + 1 / 2. So that's my s

1343
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:59,120
um and I need to do this.

1344
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:02,120
Yeah, that's

1345
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:02,120
um

1346
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:08,760
Oh, this may not quite work for this.

1347
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,440
Actually, I'm not sure if this will

1348
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:18,239
imply Linux theorem. Lin proved his

1349
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:20,080
theorem with the forier method. Um,

1350
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:22,159
let's come back to that next time. I

1351
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,480
think we have just enough time to do the

1352
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:28,480
nice double counting argument and uh and

1353
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:33,040
then do the the for the next.

1354
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:34,880
Okay. Um so proof we're going to count

1355
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:40,480
uh coincidences.

1356
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:42,719
That's the set of x1 and x2 and x and p

1357
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:48,080
in our set of directions or set of

1358
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:51,239
primes. So that pi p of x1 equals pi p

1359
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:51,239
of x2.

1360
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:58,880
Okay. So we'll count this two different

1361
01:15:54,960 --> 01:16:02,400
ways. One is a lower bound. So star is

1362
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:04,000
at least for every direction.

1363
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:07,520
When I do this projection, there are

1364
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:10,320
only s images. So a typical image has x

1365
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:13,520
over s pre-im images. square that for my

1366
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:15,520
choice of x1 and x2 and then multiply by

1367
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:23,120
s for the number of choices of the

1368
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:27,400
projection. So that's um x^2 d s of

1369
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:27,400
okay now what's our upper bound?

1370
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:32,960
So now I going to fix imagine fixing x1

1371
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:36,440
and x2 and think about how many ps can

1372
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,440
satisfy this.

1373
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:43,920
Oh um so

1374
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:48,320
um

1375
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:50,000
so if I have pi p of x1 is equal to pi p

1376
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:57,080
of x2

1377
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:57,080
that tells us that p divides x2 - x1

1378
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:03,440
and there can't be that many different

1379
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:06,800
primes that divide x2 - x1. x2 - x1 has

1380
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:10,400
size uh n. So it could be at most log of

1381
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:13,120
n that do this. Um so star is

1382
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:16,320
upperbounded by

1383
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:19,440
um okay so so there is a case where x1

1384
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:22,080
equals x2. So that gives me x times the

1385
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:24,880
number of directions.

1386
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:27,120
And then if x1 is not equal to x2, I

1387
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:29,840
have x squar choices for x1 and x2. But

1388
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:32,840
I have only log of n choices for the

1389
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,840
direction.

1390
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:44,840
Okay. And now I'll compare these to each

1391
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,840
other.

1392
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:10,960
Okay. So I have uh x^2 * d * s inverse

1393
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:13,840
is less than x * d plus uh x^2 * log.

1394
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:17,360
So there are two cases. If this one

1395
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:20,080
dominates um then I would have that x is

1396
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:23,679
bounded by 2s

1397
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:27,280
or if this one dominates then the x's

1398
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:32,719
disappear and I get that d is bounded by

1399
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:35,880
log of n * s and and that's the that's

1400
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:35,880
the theorem.

1401
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:45,920
Okay. So let me give you an example of

1402
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:47,520
this and argue that this is uh well let

1403
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:50,960
me give you an example flavor of what

1404
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:55,920
this is telling us. So suppose that pi p

1405
01:18:50,960 --> 01:19:00,560
of x is bounded by n^ the 2/3

1406
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:05,719
for um 10 log n

1407
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:05,719
* n^ 2/3 different p

1408
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:16,600
um so if that's true then the theorem

1409
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:16,600
tells us that x is bounded by n^ X.

1410
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,719
So these primes might have size around

1411
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:31,600
this big or a bit bigger. So these

1412
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:33,199
primes are much less than n. So each

1413
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,280
projection the fact that each projection

1414
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:37,440
one at a time is small, it's not that

1415
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,560
convincing in terms of x being small.

1416
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,920
But knowing that all of these

1417
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:42,000
projections are this large number of

1418
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:44,800
projections is small. It means that x is

1419
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,800
really that small.
