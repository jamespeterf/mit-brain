loved that my whole time and during lgo

64
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:40,680
I did a lot of tech related things um

65
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,920
and yeah my relationship with fli um I'm

66
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,000
originally from London but my parents

67
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,840
were from a low-income background they

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,519
were immigrants from Ethiopia and so

69
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,200
I've been a big beneficiary of you know

70
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,840
any like Income Support uh when it comes

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,560
to education and it's always been a big

72
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,840
priority of me and my family so yeah I

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,840
was that's me

74
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,920
and I think I'm the the next in line uh

75
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,120
hi everyone um my name is

76
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,599
Elisa um I am a master of Finance

77
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,319
graduate also from the 23 uh program so

78
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,640
graduated last year um prior to that I

79
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,159
worked in banking back in Europe I'm

80
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,760
originally from

81
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,640
Germany and then found my way to the SV

82
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,080
years ago with this master's program um

83
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,480
similar to Daniel have been uh benefited

84
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,720
a lot from um anything like from

85
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,239
scholarships and low income support back

86
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,840
in Germany my parents were both U

87
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,080
musicians so there was a background

88
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:49,200
heavily in that music domain and nothing

89
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,920
much more be beyond that so um that's

90
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,599
why things have been uh very different

91
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,079
for me and um I was able to follow two

92
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:58,799
passions at MIT I did uh Finance but I

93
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,280
also have a huge passion for cyber

94
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,519
security which led to my current wall I

95
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,159
am right now a risk analyst in McKenzie

96
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,079
more specifically I'm working in the

97
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,680
Cyber practice supporting um or Rising

98
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:15,000
companies in their cyber risk post

99
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,919
posture and um yeah that's that's so far

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,919
about me and I'm passing over to

101
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:28,320

116
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,720
everyone amazing thank you all such a

117
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,600
great breath of experience tonight uh so

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,960
for our first question I'll lead into it

119
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,840
by saying uh I know like many of you my

120
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,360
parents were really encouraging me to

121
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,720
pursue as much higher education as

122
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,280
possible but had absolutely no idea what

123
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,240
business school was so I really came

124
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,759
into picking where to go uh without

125
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,639
familial uh input most of them said why

126
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,560
are you pursuing even more so I would

127
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,160
love to hear about why some of you

128
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,800
actually chose SLO and why you found

129
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,440
that this was the best fit for you and

130
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,120
kind of what decisions or what factors

131
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,120
went into that

132
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,000
decision I'm happy to talk about it a

133
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,919
little bit um I had a similar experience

134
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,360
um so I had a a first graduate degree

135
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,400
and I had the same experience where my

136
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,080
parents didn't quite know what um

137
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,319
graduate school really meant and what it

138
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,680
entailed um how where a law school even

139
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,680
fit into the college um experience and

140
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,479
so I had to sort of navigate that on my

141
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,400
own so whenever I I did the SF program

142
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:16,120
which is um midcareer which I I did at

143
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,520
42 so by then my parents were

144
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,080
familiarized um with uh what grad school

145
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,440
looked like but they had the same

146
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,840
reaction of why do you want another

147
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:31,120
degree um and and I I I did and I chose

148
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:36,400
Sloan in particular because it was so um

149
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:39,520
Mission based and um I I would say that

150
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,400
if anything it felt like my background

151
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,280
and a diversity of background um was

152
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,000
seen as an advantage and something that

153
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,360
I was bringing to um the school and from

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,520
everyone that I spoke with during the

155
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,599
admissions process prior to other

156
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,560
students um it it really felt like that

157
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,919
was an asset to me and I was bringing a

158
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,199
color that maybe was under repesent Ed

159
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:07,879
at the school um and I was very grateful

160
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,879
to be able to to have that

161
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,639
valued um yeah for for me uh Sloan was

162
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,120
or I guess it's more the MIT brand I

163
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,840
think that was the big ER for me um yeah

164
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,160
I had like African parents and they like

165
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,039
you know adorned you know the MIT name

166
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,080
in every regard but like they had no

167
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:34,360
idea what business school was

168
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:36,960
and so I think a lot of it was like me

169
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,120
working out what I wanted to do in my

170
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,520
life and also more importantly what kind

171
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,199
of community I wanted to keep around me

172
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,360
I think one thing that I learned from

173
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,039
being going to Sloan and doing lgo which

174
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,680
is the double Masters is the community

175
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,720
people you keep tend to be like quite

176
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,199
nerdy a little bit

177
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,080
International uh passionate about like

178
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,599
like the most random things like it's

179
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,000
like something something Tech and like

180
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,319
that's the community I wanted to keep

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,240
around me and that's the people I wanted

182
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,960
to become and so Sloan just kind of like

183
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,759
checked all those boxes compared to

184
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,039
other schools and yeah I'd like like to

185
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,120
say that I you know contributed to that

186
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,400
Community as well as you know like

187
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,319
obained a lot of value from those

188
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,159
communities so yeah that's why I chose

189
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,919
Stone and I wanted to add to that to

190
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:30,199
Daniel's comment on community they think

191
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:31,560
in visiting different schools and and

192
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,279
through the kind of the process of

193
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,560
selection for me Sloan stood out because

194
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:42,120
it seemed like it had the most like just

195
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,279
down to earth people who were who were

196
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,399
like Dan like passionate about something

197
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,720
coming from all kinds of different

198
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,120
diverse backgrounds but that like down

199
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,360
to Earth was really appealing aspect for

200
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,440
me

201
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,680
because I'm sure as you know we're on

202
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,120
the fly fly panel right so sometimes you

203
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,720
get impostor syndrome right familiar

204
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,880
feelings and being able to like feel

205
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,680
like you can fit in and just be yourself

206
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:12,000
was was really really a big deal so when

207
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,880
I when I walked into Sloan I talked to

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,560
you know prospective sloes and I talked

209
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,680
to sloes who are already there I felt

210
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,040
like okay like cool I don't have to you

211
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,560
know try to put on many many layers of

212
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,160
of trying to be somebody who I'm not I

213
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,600
can just be myself because I see all

214
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,079
kinds of people here and everybody's

215
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,079
just seemed like really nice kind and

216
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,079
interesting

217
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,079
I can also I I can only agree to what

218
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:39,720
was said already um that that hits the

219
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:42,000
nail really um what what made me choose

220
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,160
Sloan was actually uh because I went

221
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,519
there already for a semester abroad and

222
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,200
uh I basically came back to the campus

223
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,160
and I chose this because I was like for

224
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,680
the first time like seen as Who I Am

225
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,040
with all the interest I bring to the

226
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,519
campus and I was able to find every like

227
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,959
for every corner with any Niche there's

228
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,399
something uh you can go to and

229
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,640
you can't really tell from where

230
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,839
somebody's coming from because this

231
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,800
nerdiness brings in like the the DNA of

232
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,480
M is like what kind of interest and how

233
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,519
much curiosity you bring with it and not

234
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,600
much more it's really basically who you

235
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:17,440
are and you can really bring your full

236
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,640
self to to the compos

237
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,200
yeah absolutely so much of that

238
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,959
resonates with how we all feel here

239
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,120
today and I love that so many of you

240
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,440
brought up Community you're actually

241
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,440
beating me to the punch a little bit

242
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,240
that was my next series of questions I

243
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,959
know that um one I one of the things I

244
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,800
think that is so beautiful about the fly

245
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,240
Community both in slone and out is that

246
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,399
it really is a focus on lifting each

247
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,279
other up I know that when I talk about

248
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,519
my educational attainment it's not a

249
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:43,880
oneperson show I'm here because of so

250
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:45,760
many people who came before me and

251
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,959
supported me so I would love to hear

252
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,399
about uh any additional information you

253
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:51,440
have about what communities you were

254
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,040
part of at slan and how you got involved

255
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,040
in the Sloan community and especially if

256
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,600
you have any examples on how those

257
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,560
communities supported you because this

258
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,040
is a pretty intense experience

259
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,399
regardless of the program you

260
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,839
participate

261
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:11,000
in I can jump in on that one to open us

262
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,440
up I I am really really happy to be on

263
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,920
this p panel right now because two three

264
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:21,320
years ago so 20 about 2020 was myself

265
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,639
and two other sloes we founded uh fly at

266
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,720
Sloan and I remember I remember the

267
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,519
process and I remember the excitement

268
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,639
and kind of coming back to this kind of

269
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,399
point of community I remember was like

270
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,639
small very very small group of us there

271
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:40,320
was maybe six or seven people coming uh

272
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,519
doing ask me anything on socio economics

273
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,880
and that's kind of how we found each

274
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,720
other initially and connected and then

275
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,760
myself and two other slones like you

276
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,480
know what we're missing we're missing

277
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,360
this community and official student club

278
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,320
and this the amount of support um just

279
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,360
completely outpouring support both from

280
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,600
the school administration and like our

281
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,399
classmates that we saw immediately was

282
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,240
just amazing so you know coming back to

283
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,320
the point of like fitting in and

284
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,800
involvement and and being able to have

285
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,079
people like you but also with allies who

286
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,160
want to listen to your story want to be

287
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,720
able to support you want to be able to

288
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,760
relate to you and like elevate your

289
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,279
voice um it was it was a really really

290
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,360
awesome experience in that way so it's

291
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:32,160
kind of coming coming full full circle

292
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,160
being on this panel uh so pretty pretty

293
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:38,440
great yeah I want to follow up on the

294
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,480
out foring a support um I think one big

295
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,000
community that got to me I guess two big

296
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,760
communities that was to me and I guess

297
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,800
this panel is for prospective applicants

298
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,600
but like before I joined Sloan was the

299
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,920
blacks and business Students Association

300
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,399
they reached out to me before I like six

301
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,959
months before I got the offer and like

302
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:57,399
the day after they reached out so um

303
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,199
they like already had assigned me like a

304
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,880
mentor or someone to like support me

305
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:03,680
through the transition process to give

306
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,519
me advice on housing so like yeah I

307
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,880
think Sloan is not short on support of

308
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:13,600
this ispit like that um and the second

309
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,760
group is the lgo group um I can

310
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,320
confidently say I wouldn't have

311
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,040
graduated without um the support of

312
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,720
lgs's um just because like the work code

313
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,600
was like so high and so yeah I find that

314
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,760
like the communities that supported me

315
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,720
during Stone was just like I it was

316
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,800
something I hadn't found before even in

317
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,959
college and even to a degree at work now

318
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,000
it's like it's definitely very unique to

319
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:41,680
the school and something I like like

320
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,680
love with all my

321
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:49,199
heart I would also add one thing that is

322
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:54,240
it it stays also after you graduate so

323
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:58,160
I'm uh I'm Amazed by how many people um

324
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,759
reply that I I'm texting from the Alumni

325
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,240
network so now as an alumna like I'm I'm

326
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:04,600
reaching out to people across

327
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,920
Generations that have been at MIT a

328
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,920
decade ago uh but they they share the

329
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,959
same values very very interested in the

330
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,600
younger generation as well so I think

331
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:16,880
there also one advice I can give to to

332
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,440
anyone like it's not only when you're

333
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,480
studying or at grad school but it

334
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,639
continues to be in your back pocket

335
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,639
whenever you need it in your

336
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,079
career um I would add that the the the

337
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,440
best and greatest community that I got

338
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,959
out of the experience was my own cohort

339
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:41,639
um so the the SF program is about 110 or

340
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:45,639
so people uh we have a WhatsApp chat

341
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:48,040
that is literally all 108 of us that

342
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,560
graduated from the program still we're

343
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,320
very much in touch with each other we

344
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:57,160
travel to see each other and um uh as

345
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,800
Alisa was saying um we we draw on each

346
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,120
other for advice and

347
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,279
um resources still um and probably will

348
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,560
for a very long time but getting to know

349
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,440
those people um was one of the best

350
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,160
experiences of my life so your your

351
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,399
cohort and your classmates are going to

352
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:21,279
continually surprise you and how amazing

353
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:25,399
they are um but also how down to earth

354
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:27,839
and supportive and um and relatable

355
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,199
there's there's a lot of adversity and

356
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,240
um in my does a really good job sonone

357
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:34,600
does a really good job of giving you the

358
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,959
opportunity to showcase your background

359
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,360
so that you aren't compelled to just

360
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,600
keep it to yourself you actually share

361
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,240
it with people and then there it makes

362
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,480
relating to each other and bonding with

363
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,199
each other easy and of course it's a

364
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,720
really great group of

365
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:53,360
people absolutely SL does a really great

366
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,880
job of uh helping us find either smaller

367
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,079
cohorts or smaller groups so we can

368
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,800
really get to know each other even

369
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,600
though Sloan encompasses all these

370
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,040
programs and really does encourage us to

371
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,079
show up as our full selves which I think

372
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,199
is really special and I want to dig into

373
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,959
a little bit about how you all actually

374
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:09,199
engage with your Alumni network so Alisa

375
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:12,040
kind of building on something that you

376
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,279
said what uh how you engaged alumni

377
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,440
while you were here and after and how

378
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,920
you found you know community and

379
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,720
advancement through engaging with this

380
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,720
lone Alumni

381
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,240
network I mean I I can go first given

382
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,519
that I just just mentioned that and it's

383
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,600
a currently a big part of my life

384
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,759
because I'm considering like constantly

385
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,720
where to drive my career and um when

386
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,240
you're at bad school you're most exposed

387
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,399
to the to your cohort and maybe they

388
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,399
buff and then the next ones but it is as

389
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,920
I said like it's a like you find across

390
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,199
Generations a lot of people to reach out

391
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:52,199
to so I don't know exactly how I use it

392
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:55,040
there's something about to say about

393
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:58,360
like the background you bring in maybe

394
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,319
you have to find more advice than others

395
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,639
that can from a high income family

396
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:04,439
because there's some sort of compass

397
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,600
missing I don't know how to describe it

398
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,039
but sometimes you feel like there's a

399
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,760
corrective missing or like a clear path

400
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,600
is sometimes not so simple because

401
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,039
nobody else have have told you how to do

402
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,839
it there's also a lot of Advantage

403
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,240
because you can do it by yourself and

404
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,559
nobody's telling you what to do because

405
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,480
your parents maybe don't even know what

406
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:23,679
a business school is on the other hand

407
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:27,039
you might get lost easily so I think the

408
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,600
Alumni network is very helpful to to

409
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,679
give you some sort of like feedback or

410
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,960
like

411
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,039
if something resonates with your

412
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,919
interests or not and you'll find for

413
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,880
sure people that share that do something

414
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,799
you're excited about can reach out to

415
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,679
them that's how I do it and um I'm I'm

416
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:44,440
surprised like how many people are like

417
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,919
happy to share how their Journey was and

418
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,919
um yeah can can really recommend

419
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,200
that for me it um yeah I can speak maybe

420
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,440
to postgraduation experience it feels

421
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,280
like uh the community doesn't stop so

422
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,440
I'm in New York which is one of the

423
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,640
bigger sort of hubs that sends a lot of

424
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,240
Sony's out and it feels like there is

425
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,640
like a massive community of people here

426
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,280
like you know someone's holding a

427
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,159
housewarming on Saturday I just came

428
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,799
back from a wedding of a Sony it's like

429
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,919
it's a community that just like never

430
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:20,240
stops and so it has it supports me you

431
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,240
know both socially and like emotionally

432
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,159
to this day and then you know within

433
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,360
Sloan it was um an amazing experience to

434
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:31,480
feel like you know like Eliza said like

435
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,039
you feel like you have a support network

436
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,159
to give you advice when you don't know

437
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,559
what to do next and I think like during

438
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,640
the recruiting season that's like

439
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,600
especially pertinent uh when you want to

440
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,880
know like okay how do I pursue this

441
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,159
really Niche startup that I've never

442
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,919
heard about before but then there's a

443
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,799
Sony there that knows someone that knows

444
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,080
someone and so there's always that

445
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,400
connection that helps you um you know

446
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,039
recruit but also you know let loose a

447
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,039
little bit on the

448
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,159
weekends I have a lot of success with

449
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:04,320
the career development office um it's

450
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:07,679
got a a great platform that will help

451
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,159
pair you with somebody um who is either

452
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,320
in the field or has experience that

453
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:12,799
you're looking for they actually Avail

454
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,080
themselves they put themselves out on

455
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,440
this platform to accept um meetings with

456
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,200
you so that that is something that's

457
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,000
available to you which is phenomenal and

458
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,799
even if it's just like hey I'm thinking

459
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,600
about a startup or I'm thinking about a

460
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:29,320
career switch or something like that

461
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,720
they're there to um just bounce some

462
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,360
ideas off which is really great but I

463
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,559
also actually use LinkedIn constantly

464
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:41,280
and I pull up other sonies um and I've

465
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:45,440
had a 100% success rate in reaching out

466
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:48,320
to other slon um and um asking if I

467
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,760
could you know just tap their Network or

468
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,200
talk to them a little bit and um

469
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,200
Everybody

470
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:02,080
replies yeah I S similarly on um on my

471
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:05,559
side during during Sloan um the actual

472
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:09,480
NBA program it was really really helpful

473
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:12,480
for recruiting purposes and just kind of

474
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,960
getting advice getting mentorship which

475
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,960
a lot of the times a piece that we

476
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,039
really really need right because like at

477
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,159
Lea men we can't we're not really going

478
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,679
back to to our families to ask for

479
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:25,120
advice and might not have as big of a

480
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:27,760
network to to lean on to so getting

481
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,840
access to this huge and amazing slow

482
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:34,440
Network is a is a big big benefit and

483
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,200
then postgraduation I start working uh

484
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,880
here here at BCG and I'm in Boston

485
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,200
office so there's a lot of lot of sloes

486
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,960
around and it's been pretty awesome

487
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,600
because even on my day one right at work

488
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,440
here you walk into the room and you see

489
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,360
a bunch of slones and familiar faces

490
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,960
whether they're your year slon or prior

491
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,120
Year and that has been also um really

492
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,880
really awesome as a source of Support

493
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,880
also source of mentorship in my

494
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,760
career fantastic and so kind of winding

495
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,720
back to your time here on campus were

496
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,400
there specific resources that you found

497
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,039
were really helpful for you as a first

498
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,559
gener local income student uh or any

499
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,960
specific resources uh initiatives or

500
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,400
programs that you would recommend for

501
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,400
other students coming in with a similar

502
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:32,880
background uh well one big one for me I

503
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,120
mentioned Income Support before uh this

504
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,000
is gu very specific to the lgo program

505
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,240
but they offer a wide range of

506
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,799
fellowships for people who sort of can't

507
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,640
afford tuition and I'm like one of the

508
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,240
biggest beneficiaries of that like

509
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,520
without a doubt I couldn't have attended

510
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,279
business school any kind of grad school

511
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:54,440
without it and so it very much unlocked

512
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:57,640
the ability to sort of not have to

513
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:01,440
stress about tuition costs and sort of

514
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,600
emers myself in full stone experience um

515
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,200
because I'm like I was one of those

516
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,679
people like I couldn't go to my parents

517
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,240
like they can't afford it so like you

518
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,960
know who so it's nice to feel like I

519
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,240
feel supported from the lgo program

520
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:16,120
through the fellowship and I think this

521
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,080
extends to MIT um Sloan MBA program too

522
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,679
where they have a wide range of

523
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,640
fellowships too so um yeah income

524
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,200
support for me was like my biggest um

525
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,159
Unblocker when it comes to attending

526
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,559
Sloan and I felt very supported from the

527
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,559
program then

528
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,240
I would iterate what Candice was saying

529
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,720
about the career development office I

530
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,679
engag with them quite early and I'm

531
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,039
still in contact with my um responsible

532
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,919
person she's just checking in a couple

533
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:49,279
of months I'm going and um I think yeah

534
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,080
this is this is one of the greatest

535
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:55,960
resources that stays beyond the beyond

536
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,880
graduation um the program office was

537
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:04,559
really helpful um to me but also most of

538
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:07,200
my um cohort mates were um parents they

539
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:09,320
had children and so moving your entire

540
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,279
family across the world um finding a

541
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,159
place to live that is Affordable they

542
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,440
really tap the resources of the program

543
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:18,200
office to help guide them through it

544
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,679
wasn't just necessarily um you know

545
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,039
moving here it's it's all a new country

546
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,360
and a lot of things for them to have to

547
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:27,279
navigate and Boston's a busy place and

548
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,919
um there were a lot of resources that

549
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:32,559
they can help you so I would I get the

550
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,559
advice from your program office as

551
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,440
well yep all great advice and I'll just

552
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,559
add a couple sents as someone who's kind

553
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,360
of on the ground now um I've been really

554
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,240
impressed by how many paid opportunities

555
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,480
there are also around Sloan during the

556
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,880
semester there's I know pretty much

557
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,679
everyone I know is a TA and a research

558
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,240
assistant there's in semester

559
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,440
internships there's been a number of

560
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,840
opportunities for ways to kind of get

561
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,520
money to help you get through this

562
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,760
semester as well as I think Sloan has a

563
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,360
a culture where no we don't want anyone

564
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,320
to feel excluded so there are also a

565
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,320
number of events that are not

566
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,240
financially intensive um and like I said

567
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,200
earlier there's a social impact fund so

568
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,080
if you want to pursue something social

569
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,200
impact related over the summer there is

570
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,640
a stien you can apply for to help pad

571
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,960
that so it means that you know students

572
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,480
who aren't coming into Sloan with a huge

573
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,200
number of savings are excluded from kind

574
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,120
of pursuing those opportunities that

575
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,559
aren't able to pay you as much so there

576
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,520
are a couple of different things around

577
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:33,640
campus to help us feel a little bit more

578
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:36,120
like we're not inhibited by the

579
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,520
background and uh we got a question in

580
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,000
from the audience that I really really

581
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,720
loved and it's as a first generation

582
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,559
college graduate or low-income member of

583
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,320
the slone community how do you balance

584
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,279
the drive to push your limits and break

585
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,960
new barriers while taking the time to

586
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,120
celebrate and acknowledge your victories

587
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,120
and achievements

588
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,799
I know everyone is smiling because we're

589
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:08,640
all probably reflecting and thinking of

590
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,919
that it's a difficult that it's a

591
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,480
difficult thing to do um for me I I can

592
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,320
definitely speak for myself it's a it's

593
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,679
an

594
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,600
ongoing uh striking of a balance and the

595
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,080
reminders to myself to quote quote stop

596
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,799
and smell the roses right and and enjoy

597
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,799
I have a h one and a halfy old daughter

598
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:31,039
now and she is definitely helping kind

599
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,039
of bring that balance and pull me more

600
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:38,120
into the enjoying the the small you know

601
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:39,919
happy happy moments on uh you know as as

602
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,520
as you plan your life and your

603
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,520
achievements and your next steps to be

604
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,159
able to kind of pause reflect on

605
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,799
everything that you've done and how far

606
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,880
we've come and um I know all of us on

607
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:55,120
the panel and folks you know in the uh

608
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,840
all participants listening in I'm sure

609
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:01,399
that the path for any lwi income first

610
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,840
first gen student is a typically pretty

611
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:06,480
long right and there's a lot of

612
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:11,559
challenges to to overcome so I think

613
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:13,919
it's it's probably a well-deserved pause

614
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:16,600
for for most of us to look back and and

615
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,080
just appreciate how far we've come and

616
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,960
uh what we've done and the GD and

617
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,960
resilience that it's

618
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,480
taken um I don't think I balanced it

619
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:31,200
well to be honest I think like like

620
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,320
candidly I think it's very easy to get

621
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,480
caught up when your career trajectory

622
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,000
your money your Liv Stones your dydx is

623
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,200
not positive like when that gradient is

624
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,919
not positive you can get very much

625
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,279
caught up in that and feel like you're

626
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,159
not you know pushing your limits you not

627
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:49,080
breaking

628
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:50,679
barriers um and so you know I think I

629
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,279
think the times when I do double check

630
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:54,159
myself and try to be a bit more bit more

631
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:56,760
optimistic and acknowledge like where

632
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,760
I've succeeded is like when I speak to

633
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,240
like my family who are like are still

634
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,799
like you know like they're still like so

635
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,360
like like the same they're like

636
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,000
consistent throughout my whole life it's

637
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:10,120
like a good day to to compare how you

638
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,640
are now versus like how you were in the

639
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,039
past

640
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,880
and I think when they like you know

641
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:17,080
especially my dad like my dad's like oh

642
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,600
like you could try this you could try

643
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,640
that or you've changed XY Z like it's

644
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,919
like a very good reference point for me

645
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,080
and yeah I think it's a good way for me

646
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,440
to slow down so it's like the community

647
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,640
I keep around me I think allows me to

648
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,320
sort of see where I am and how I'm

649
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,440
feeling but I don't think I balance it

650
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:39,000
well like I think that's like the

651
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,279
truth um I'm also not sure if I balance

652
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,240
it well on this question really it's

653
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,559
it's a really good one I mean also if

654
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,960
you think about like there's certain

655
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:50,559
selection Biers going on the fact coming

656
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,480
from a low income family to already be

657
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,320
here that are that are the ones per

658
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,640
definition that are driven towards

659
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,679
reaching something very far um so that

660
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,679
makes us all very driven and I like

661
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,880
Daniel's point of like finding a

662
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,159
reference point that humbles you down

663
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,080
and that can be in my case like the

664
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:12,200
oldest friendships I have like the

665
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,720
people that know me well remind me that

666
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,880
maybe the starting conditions have been

667
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,640
different and my fear was always like it

668
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,000
goes up and then when is going down but

669
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,799
you you reach that step where you are at

670
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,720
at grad school so it's it's a plateau

671
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,080
and that's something I tell myself so

672
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,440
can go up but it can't go down anymore

673
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,320
because I bring that fear with with it

674
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,159
because growing up like having Financial

675
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,600
concerns is something that is Raising

676
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,120
much more than for others like others

677
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,840
like I want to get from Rich to Rich I

678
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,240
I'm like okay don't want to go back so

679
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,440
that's something um that I tell myself

680
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,559
so it's it's it's getting always better

681
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:51,039
so

682
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:53,000
yeah yeah I would um say it's gonna be

683
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,559
drinking through a fir hose while you're

684
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,399
there in in a good way because there are

685
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,120
so many things to do and there's so many

686
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
opportunities you can spread your

687
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,320
yourself a little bit thin between the

688
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:05,519
opportunities too and maybe diffuse your

689
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:08,480
impact on anyone um so you'll you have

690
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:12,799
to be judicious and you have to be

691
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,600
strategic and going in try to have a

692
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,120
plan on what you want or how much you

693
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,600
what you want to get specifically out of

694
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,200
your experience at Sloan and you can

695
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,559
help strategize around that by talking

696
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,799
to people um and you know talking to us

697
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:29,039
and messaging us and talking um uh with

698
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,440
the program office and things like but

699
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,799
uh to the original Point how do you

700
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,360
balance the two

701
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:36,159
things you can still be really involved

702
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,919
because there are a lot of special and

703
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:43,519
fun activities that the um that the

704
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:46,120
program offers and that um uh uh MIT

705
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,519
does in general that allows you to be

706
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,840
connected you're still there you're

707
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,880
still hanging out with your so on a

708
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,440
level you're still networking um but

709
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,000
you're actually taking some time away

710
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,840
and doing something fun and you know

711
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,679
going to one of the many activities that

712
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,080
they um uh set up for you so take

713
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:04,200
advantage of those because it gives you

714
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,720
a breather you you get to step away but

715
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,360
you still get to be around um people

716
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,760
whom you're really going to

717
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,360
like it's very family friendly in my

718
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,200
experience it was very family friendly

719
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,600
and so you know if you are traveling

720
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,120
with um a family or bring in your family

721
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,320
then a lot of times there's activities

722
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,880
for the kids

723
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,720
too absolutely SOS Partners kids dogs

724
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,240
the whole family are welcome it almost

725
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,440
almost every SL

726
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,159
event and so kind of jumping off of what

727
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,600
you said about how it's like drinking

728
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:37,320
from a fire hose um are there any other

729
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,919
things that you wish you had known about

730
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,200
Sloan before you started here God

731
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,799
everybody gave me the proper

732
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,200
admonishments everybody was like yeah

733
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,279
it's going to be too much it's a kid

734
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:48,440
candy store kind of a thing um that's

735
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:51,080
really true I wish I I understood it

736
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,159
fully and if I could take a second pass

737
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:56,120
at it I probably would and I would do

738
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,840
things a little bit differently um but I

739
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,000
would actually spend more time with my

740
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,080
with my cohort and I would get to know

741
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,080
even more people and I would cross over

742
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,679
a little bit more to the infants um and

743
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:13,679
the lgo students and really get to know

744
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,679
people um uh in this course and

745
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,279
others um I think one thing I would do

746
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,559
different is maybe frame my experience

747
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,639
differently I think I came in with the

748
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:27,080
mindset that like I'm here to Career

749
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:28,840
pivot I'm here to make friends and

750
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,360
that's it like I did didn't like that

751
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,120
was like my one track mind goal but like

752
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,399
in hindsight I think the way I would

753
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,120
frame it now is it's a lowrisk way of

754
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:41,279
trying out a bunch of things that you

755
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,000
like can do literally literally anything

756
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,279
it's you mentioned like can call you

757
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,039
mentioned like the social impact fund

758
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:48,000
but like one thing I regret is like not

759
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:50,240
coming in being like maybe I could do a

760
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,760
startup maybe I could you know leverage

761
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,840
the fact that MIT gives you a bunch of

762
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,399
free money to you start whatever like

763
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,039
nonsense business you want maybe not

764
00:31:55,399 --> 00:32:00,320
nonsense but like any kind of business

765
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:02,200
want and so I think if I had come in

766
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,120
with that mindset I think I would have

767
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,880
been a bit more exploratory and like

768
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,159
similar to what Kanda said like that

769
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,720
could mean meeting people outside your

770
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,840
program it could mean a a bunch of

771
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,039
different things but like not being too

772
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,559
like goals focused but rather being like

773
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,159
path and journey

774
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:19,159
focused um

775
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,360
yeah um I agree a lot with with u what

776
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,320
you guys saying and

777
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,880
maybe to add like think about the timing

778
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,480
of things like if you have a one year

779
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,200
program or two years program or whatever

780
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,720
like think about like zoom out quickly

781
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,440
that that is what what I've would have

782
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,519
Tau myself like zoom out quickly with

783
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,399
your interest go into everything and

784
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:46,399
then there's something about like

785
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,159
repetition like if you find something

786
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,639
then then stick with it and explore it

787
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,159
more and more I think one of the

788
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:52,440
mistakes I was doing is like I come in

789
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:54,880
and I was like okay I'm open to

790
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,519
different things but I I lost myself

791
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,799
also because I was trying like every day

792
00:32:56,519 --> 00:33:01,440
you have a decision of like 10 events or

793
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,799
like something is going on so have a

794
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,559
have a mind like have an idea of how you

795
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:07,120
make decisions do you want to try every

796
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:08,399
day something new or do you want to

797
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,440
stick with something you liked in the

798
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,240
beginning and and try to to build a

799
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,760
network around it and uh engage early

800
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,440
with Aluma Network that is something I

801
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,159
learned after this I should have done

802
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:21,080
this much earlier um strategically so if

803
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:22,760
you go out of that school you you have

804
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,039
an idea of like who is your network on

805
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,600
the street because it's very different

806
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:30,799
when you're not getting more on this

807
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:32,360
very nicely sympathic MIT slown umbrella

808
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,039
U which you take it with it but the

809
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,679
world is sometimes sometimes not so nice

810
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:37,679
you want to know your

811
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:46,799
people yeah I'll I'll Echo canice's

812
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:49,519
Point earlier on the relationships and

813
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,080
and getting to know your cohort getting

814
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,159
to know folks and other cohorts I think

815
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,840
meeting more people and then building

816
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,279
relationship with them and getting to

817
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,080
know them

818
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:01,639
beyond the first initial conversation

819
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,399
there's like the same kind of template

820
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:05,080
of conversation typically happens right

821
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:06,600
as long you meet new person hey what did

822
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,639
you do before what are you doing now

823
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,040
what are you planning to do like

824
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,440
actually kind of digging a little bit

825
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:17,839
deeper uh to understand and learn this

826
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,800
person um I I've done some of it I was

827
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:23,560
in in doing my two-year MBA during Co so

828
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,879
it was a little bit of a hiccup in our

829
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,399
ability to do it well but that is like

830
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,040
the best I think advice and the the best

831
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:35,079
way to really I think in my opinion to

832
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,440
to get the most um out of out of the

833
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:39,720
time it's loone is is meeting people and

834
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,200
really building those relationships

835
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:45,119
because the the people are your the

836
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,399
classmates that um you have are are

837
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,720
pretty amazing and and you will keep

838
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:50,720
those relationships after you

839
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:56,359
graduate absolutely great points and I'm

840
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,480
pulling from the chat now we have a

841
00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:00,480
number of really great questions

842
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,280
um so an anonymous attendee I really

843
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,320
appreciated Olga's comment about fit and

844
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,000
being myself at the same time I know

845
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,440
schools that try to support fly students

846
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,680
like us aren't perfect could you be uh

847
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,119
as candid as possible and tell us about

848
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,320
some of the more difficult moments when

849
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:15,920
you were like oh I don't fited as much

850
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,640
as the other students from non-fi

851
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,640
backgrounds how did you navigate that

852
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,000
I

853
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:36,599
think one for me one experience uh

854
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,480
tended to be like around like trips and

855
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:42,200
money um I think you there are some

856
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,520
students who are able to just do every

857
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:49,079
single trip and they can afford it and I

858
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,400
definitely couldn't do that and so I

859
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:53,160
mean there was two ways I tried to

860
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,680
navigate it was like one was you know

861
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,359
trying to you know find you fun times or

862
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:01,440
like other things that got rid of that

863
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:04,440
fomo locally something that I could

864
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,640
afford um and the second one was like

865
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,359
plan the trips myself and contribute to

866
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,319
those communities so that I'm the one

867
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:13,720
who's aware of the fact that it's now

868
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:17,560
cost prohibitive and so those are my

869
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,560
strategies for doing but again it's not

870
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:29,520
perfect yeah for for me some of the

871
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:32,560
moments where you you know I felt like I

872
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,480
didn't fit in and it's it's the

873
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,240
conversations that sometimes you can't

874
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:41,520
relate to right like hey what did you

875
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:45,200
all my parents have a house in h is it

876
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,839
Hampton's um right or or a lot of the

877
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,599
hobbies that you know I didn't know how

878
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:52,640
to ski um I ended up learning later on

879
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:55,280
uh and got peer

880
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,000
pressured at at long which I did don't

881
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,440
regret but I think it's some of those

882
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
times where you're just kind of you know

883
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,839
you're part of the conversation but

884
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,160
you're can't really relate you can't

885
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:09,280
really add anything because everybody

886
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,560
seems to connect on that topic but you

887
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,839
just don't have any experience and you

888
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,640
feel a little bit you know awkward just

889
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:20,480
kind of like nodding or trying to stay

890
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,920
positive about it but uh you know you

891
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,800
you really you feel like you don't

892
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,640
belong in that in that part of the

893
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,480
conversation yeah I I think for me that

894
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,040
definitely that definitely occurs and I

895
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,720
I had similar experience where everybody

896
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,960
was going to Davos just just going to

897
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:40,920
Davos um and uh not everybody could and

898
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:44,240
and so you feel it yourself or you feel

899
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:47,240
it on behalf of others but um I'm you

900
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,839
know like I said I'm from rural Texas uh

901
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:54,000
my parents were laborers and so um sort

902
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:58,560
of the the

903
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,119
um the the pedigree or the um fine

904
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,800
I didn't always felt like I had or

905
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,800
exuded um the way that some students did

906
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,359
and so I felt like even in in my 40s

907
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,400
like I stuck out like a sore thumb um I

908
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,680
would say if you feel that way um own it

909
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,480
I would say two things just own it um

910
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,240
there's

911
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,520
something great about being your

912
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:23,119
authentic self and um if if you don't

913
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,079
have experience with something or a

914
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,160
certain situation um you'll probably

915
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,319
find that other people haven't as well

916
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:32,480
and but also it again it was just such

917
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:33,880
an a supportive friendly group of people

918
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,599
that somebody always felt it felt like

919
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,160
somebody was taking me under their wing

920
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,440
but you can also the second thing I

921
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,160
would say is that you can also find a

922
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,400
mentor whom you can be very candid with

923
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,119
and say like this is sort of my

924
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,000
background I I really feel uncomfortable

925
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,000
in these

926
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,040
situations um and try to find a mentor

927
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,720
who maybe has a similar background or

928
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,599
can relate in some way who can help

929
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,880
guide you through that or at least talk

930
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,160
you up um because like I said when I

931
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,599
first started this is actually a

932
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,240
strength of yours you're coming from a

933
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:01,200
different background with a different

934
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,480
Viewpoint um and that is that diversity

935
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,640
of thinking is so valuable in the school

936
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,240
and in the in the business world and in

937
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,280
an innovation environment so please

938
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,280
always just think of it as an

939
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,160
asset and we have maybe last maybe

940
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,079
second to last question but I've seen a

941
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,839
couple questions in the chat about

942
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,920
balancing kind of going from being a

943
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:31,079
full-time employee and especially when

944
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,839
you have family who's who relies on you

945
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,960
either kids or parents what is how have

946
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,520
you navigated the transition from you

947
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,319
know being able to play that role in

948
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,280
your family to kind of still bearing

949
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:46,000
that stress either material or emotional

950
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,000
uh while here it's alone

951
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,960
Courtney would you give the question one

952
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,720
more

953
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,520
time yeah so um the question was about

954
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,440
what how did you manage going from kind

955
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,680
of being a full-time employee kind of

956
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,480
bringing money in and having either kids

957
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,200
or parents or other family members who

958
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,200
rely on you financially how did you

959
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,920
transition from that to being at Sloan

960
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,680
where many of us don't have income

961
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,839
anymore and we're still worried about

962
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,839
financially supporting our family

963
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,920
also a big question we can maybe we can

964
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,640
also switch to a different one as well

965
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,400
um I'll just briefly touch on I have

966
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,400
family who financially relies on me a

967
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,680
bit and that's when I really pulled in

968
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:48,520
other parts of my community um Extended

969
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,760
relatives siblings other people to help

970
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:52,520
bear that weight and taking advantage of

971
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,240
some of the opportunities to make money

972
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,839
while here uh to supplement but also you

973
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,280
know having the hard conversations of

974
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:01,760
saying my ability to support the family

975
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,000
is Ching right now and it might not be

976
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,520
forever but finding you know it's it's

977
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,040
different for everyone finding ways to

978
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,680
balance that um and then there are ways

979
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:14,160
if you have children to navigate that

980
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:18,319
here with our um subsidized child care

981
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,680
as well um but other question is maybe

982
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,480
our last wrap up uh what advice do you

983
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,440
have for first generation students

984
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:29,680
applying maybe like a one a one sentence

985
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,680
kind of your One Word of Wisdom to leave

986
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:40,800
with um I can go first um I think words

987
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,480
of wisdom I would agree with what

988
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,920
Candace is saying see it as an advantage

989
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,359
that you can do your own path there are

990
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,680
no predefined paths you can you have to

991
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:53,480
own it and it's your your asset and you

992
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:57,440
you should like don't disappear Just go

993
00:41:53,480 --> 00:42:00,800
with it and and find your own way and um

994
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,520
yeah so I I think I leave it

995
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,240
there I'll actually piggyback on what

996
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,040
Daniel said and maybe this is a little

997
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,720
bit less philosophical a little bit more

998
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:14,839
tactical take advantage of resources

999
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:18,359
like sandbox um it's free money for a

1000
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:20,000
potential startup and um an incredible

1001
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:23,040
way to gain

1002
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,359
mentorship um because I I know I and and

1003
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,880
several other people like we don't we

1004
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:28,000
don't have familial connections that are

1005
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,119
going to connect us with reserves to

1006
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,800
help support an idea that we have but

1007
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,160
something like sandbox can actually

1008
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,760
teach you how to make those connections

1009
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,000
um and in that way kind of change your

1010
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,000
life forever it was an incredible

1011
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
experience for me um and some of my

1012
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,800
friends who have gone on um to Delta V

1013
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,200
and

1014
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,200
whatnot also be

1015
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:54,720
yourself I would say tell tell your

1016
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:58,040
story and be proud of

1017
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,839
it and then ask don't be afraid to ask

1018
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:04,000
for help ask anybody and everybody for

1019
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:06,640
help information anything and then pay

1020
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,640
it forward to

1021
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:14,000
others um yeah I don't think I can sum

1022
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,760
up all that by still say one word um

1023
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,520
yeah just echoing what everyone else has

1024
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,720
said and I guess given that this panel's

1025
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,280
for prospective applicants I think it

1026
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,920
would be like like Leverage your

1027
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,680
identity whether that's being like using

1028
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,559
a see as a superpower to tell your story

1029
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:33,400
or like using it as a super power using

1030
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:35,559
as a way to connect with other fli or

1031
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,400
even other people in general to like

1032
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:42,200
connect and like educate people about

1033
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,559
what fli means and so yeah those are

1034
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,120
that's my advice like Leverage your

1035
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:49,590
identity as your super

1036
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,590
[Music]

1037
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,040
