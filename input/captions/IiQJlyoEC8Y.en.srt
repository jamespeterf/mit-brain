1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,000
hi everyone good morning very excited

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,720
for this uh discussion where we're able

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,559
to have three terrific industry leaders

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,880
here who are dealing with some of the

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,519
generative AI uh challenges that were

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,559
coming up in earlier presentations in

7
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:18,119
their everyday uh lives and careers so I

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,160
just wanted to um start by asking our

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,680
our three panelists we have uh Lisa

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,920
gelber here who's the founder of grow

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,080
with Google and the chief marketing

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,439
Officer of Google in the Americas we

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,599
have Marco who's the global head of the

14
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,359
CIO office for ING uh a large global

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,960
bank um which he'll he'll describe in

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,120
more detail and then finally PR

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,399
natarajan from um from Capital One who's

18
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,120
the chief scientist and head of

19
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,160
Enterprise AI which I think is probably

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,960
the most fitting title we could have for

21
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,440
this for this discussion PR um but just

22
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,199
a a question for all of you to get us

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,920
started and and to dive into some

24
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:51,480
details I'd love to hear a little bit

25
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,760
about how in your roles you've been

26
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,840
dealing with generative AI applications

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,920
where you've seen kind of a no-brainer

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,079
or a slam dunk case of using these tools

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,680
and where are you thought that the tools

30
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,479
would be useful but it turns out we're

31
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,560
not there yet and maybe starting with

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,000
you Lisa and your role with grow with

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,320
Google sure

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,960
um uh good morning

35
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:19,560
everyone um so on in my world um growth

36
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,360
Google is really about digital Equity um

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,119
we're focused on how do you make sure

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,560
that the opportunities that are created

39
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,240
by technology are truly available to

40
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,479
everyone and that's really relevant in

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,720
the case of AI

42
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,479
um so we've been focused on how do you

43
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,600
give everyone the basic skills for using

44
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,360
these tools to improve their performance

45
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,840
their knowledge and their

46
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,560
productivity um so we've been talking to

47
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,799
a lot of employers um and hearing basic

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,640
use cases and and you can look at things

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,159
like even the McKenzie study from May of

50
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:58,039
this year and basically what people are

51
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,479
saying is there's great use cases in the

52
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,840
place of things like HR where people are

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,479
finding real cost savings phenomenal use

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,840
cases in customer service higher

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,040
resolution faster and then um in the

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,120
world that I work in um for the other

57
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,319
half of my job really good use cases on

58
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,239
the marketing and sales side as well

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,760
better ability to reach customers with

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,879
more personalized messages leading to

61
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,360
more efficient and effective marketing

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,400
and better sales

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,560
pipeline terrific Marco how about in in

64
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,360
the world of High Finance

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,519
the world of High Finance or digital

66
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,400
Finance for that matter there we go yeah

67
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,599
um well for us this is a logical next

68
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,840
evolution in in banking we've served

69
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,159
some some waves whether it's process

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,159
automation or the internet wave or the

71
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,040
app wave or the cloud wave modular

72
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,040
architecture wave so this is the obvious

73
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,080
next wave in banking probably leading to

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,480
new business models or business

75
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,280
propositions for that matter um and the

76
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,599
last couple of years we've been

77
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,159
experimenting a lot with the with data

78
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:07,400
usage how can we use it what really

79
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:09,400
delivers value uh one obviously is there

80
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,280
it's it's a massive use case that's all

81
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,280
the reporting that we need to do to all

82
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,720
kind of

83
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,319
stakeholders you need to do it it

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,720
delivers a certain value but I would say

85
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,680
the the most value we get out of

86
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,040
increasing customer experience in

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,159
customer interaction getting providing

88
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,519
better insights for example having a

89
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,239
better conversation more relevant and

90
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:34,720
the other one is the developer

91
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:38,400
experience um so really making life a

92
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:43,000
bit easier and faster for our developers

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,000
turning into a better time to market for

94
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,720
example um before getting into the use

95
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,280
cases Ben uh maybe just I'll make a few

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,439
comments on like what makes you ready

97
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:00,159
for uh AI um and I think there are a few

98
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:02,439
prerequisites um one is uh the talk that

99
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,239
you all just heard from Barbara uh the

100
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:07,760
state of your data

101
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:11,079
infrastructure um AI brings to life the

102
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,040
value that is resident in your data so

103
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:15,799
if you don't have your data act together

104
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,280
that's kind of the first thing to do and

105
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,320
what is the state of your data stack as

106
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,240
well the second is the overall Tech the

107
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,280
modernity of your Tech stack and your

108
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,160
Tech

109
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,440
infrastructure um are you you know

110
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,560
ideally you know Capital One went all in

111
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:37,160
on the Cloud 5 6 7 8 years ago before my

112
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,800
time uh that's a state of excellent

113
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,199
Readiness in my mind when I joined a

114
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,680
couple of years ago I was surprised by

115
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,800
the Readiness of the tech infrastructure

116
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,160
um versus are you fragmented across many

117
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,680
different Tech Stacks ETA are you Cloud

118
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,320
native or not uh the third is the state

119
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,039
of your talent uh what is the state of

120
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,080
your in-house Tech Talent what are your

121
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:58,759
gaps what do you need to bring in a lot

122
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,560
of this um the system integration

123
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,960
approach doesn't work work you know

124
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,680
classic it Enterprise it has been a lot

125
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,240
about integrating systems in third

126
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,800
parties uh but in this case you really

127
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,720
do need to have some practitioners uh

128
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,720
and so Banks uh we're not the only one

129
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,160
but we're certainly one of the uh first

130
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,440
ones uh having a history of practicing

131
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,440
machine learning uh in their decision

132
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,080
processes or putting them uh to work um

133
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,840
are are in a better state of Readiness

134
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,039
having said those I'll say uh the two

135
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,440
ones it's not going to be a big reveal

136
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,600
for anyone I mean if Jim Kramer is

137
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,400
talking about it on CNBC and saying

138
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,800
customer servicing is a big opportunity

139
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,880
for AI it's not like the best kept

140
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,479
secret in the world um but the way I

141
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,000
would look at it is take a look at where

142
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,680
is The Leverage where are most of your

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,800
opportunities uh use it as a test and

144
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,479
learn approach early on so uh customer

145
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,919
servicing is one uh we certainly uh put

146
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,199
in place systems uh these are early days

147
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,280
for everything you're asking about

148
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,000
what's working what's not working I

149
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,440
don't think we've proven anything is

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,280
actually working massively yet right we

151
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,400
just have a lot of conviction around the

152
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,599
areas where they're going to work um AR

153
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,520
you were talking about the software

154
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:16,479
piece I think globally everybody's

155
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,800
making a big bet across Industries where

156
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,800
technology is used at scale uh that

157
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,360
software development is going to be uh

158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,840
another place but it's about the full

159
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,199
sdlc a peace meal approach to just

160
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,080
authoring or just testing or this or

161
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,160
that doesn't actually give you that much

162
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,759
of an unlock but our early experiments

163
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,680
on both are super promising we're

164
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,919
already seeing lift but it's too early

165
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,960
to talk about actual numbers but I'll

166
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,280
say like in the customer servicing in

167
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,080
certain areas you can see uh pretty

168
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,960
substantive lift in terms of the agent

169
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,000
experience definely to stay with you PR

170
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,479
for a second you know we hear in earlier

171
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,880
presentations about the democratization

172
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,360
of technology and that generative AI in

173
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,319
particular could be a democratizing

174
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,319
force putting more um potential in the

175
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,639
hands of individual users but what you

176
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,960
said at the beginning I found

177
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,720
interesting where you need to have the

178
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,520
infrastructure in place to really make

179
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,080
use of these tools and not everyone has

180
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,280
that infrastructure so it seems like it

181
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,360
might take a while to get to the actual

182
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,639
democra so I wonder how you feel like I

183
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,440
think it's two different things I mean

184
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,800
the fact that the goal is

185
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,680
democratization yeah but we all know

186
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,960
democracies require a lot of work and

187
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,919
they require a lot of infrastructure and

188
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,199
they require a lot of scaffolding to

189
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:31,520
work right so I'm just talking about

190
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,479
what is is your state of Readiness yeah

191
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,039
to be to be practicing or pursuing the

192
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,520
stated goal of democratization of AI I

193
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,360
mean I think I don't think you'll find a

194
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,000
single Enterprise leader who says um my

195
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,720
goal is to make sure only like a small

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
fraction of my users can benefit from

197
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,159
this right we really do want everybody

198
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,240
to benefit and you create mechanisms uh

199
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:56,319
those mechanisms include education at

200
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,759
one end resources for experimentation

201
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,960
and learning somewhere in the middle

202
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,240
ready to use tools somewhere in there

203
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,120
but the maximum leverage you know to the

204
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:11,360
extent that everybody believes that your

205
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:15,639
data Advantage is your AI Advantage

206
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,400
right uh I certainly believe that uh you

207
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,960
can't be practicing the and your data is

208
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,199
proprietary and I think the future of AI

209
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,759
is also proprietary for Enterprise and

210
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,599
it's not proprietary in the sense that

211
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:28,560
the algorithms are particularly

212
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:30,400
proprietary so it is democratic in the

213
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,880
sense the tools Technologies and the

214
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,320
platforms are available to everyone but

215
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,440
that doesn't mean everybody's going to

216
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,640
be equally proficient at practicing how

217
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,839
to bring things to life that's where you

218
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,519
have to make investments yeah fully

219
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,480
relate to that and with that respect

220
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,800
highly recommend also one of the books

221
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,480
of Caesar by the way uh become how to

222
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,839
become Future Ready highly can recommend

223
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,200
that

224
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,959
but in indeed what you stress as well

225
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,680
you need to be ready to work with to

226
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,880
tools like this and it's not isolated uh

227
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,839
you work together with your Tech

228
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,120
ecosystem for so for example in our

229
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,640
customer interaction yes we've seen uh

230
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,040
we've seen the value but not let's say

231
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,399
from the data on its own but working

232
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,320
together with our friends at gcp for

233
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,399
example or working together with our

234
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,600
friends at Adobe George was touching

235
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,800
upon that it only works if the whole

236
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,519
system works same applies for the

237
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,720
developer experience yes thanks thank

238
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,480
you for co-pilot but it's all about

239
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,920
making life easier for developers so we

240
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,200
work together again with our friends at

241
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,040
Spotify to really improve let's say this

242
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,519
developer experience and bring the data

243
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,200
in otherwise it's just another

244
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,800
tool so to shift gears a little bit Lis

245
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,279
you know you've made these speaking of

246
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,200
democratization you've made resources

247
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:50,040
for learning about AI more available

248
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,560
through Google's AI Essentials course it

249
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,640
builds on a series of courses you've

250
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,079
already developed around data science

251
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,000
and you know we talk about maybe the

252
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:58,640
infrastructure for an organization is a

253
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,079
a data stack here we have something like

254
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,680
a training St back I wonder why you felt

255
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:05,839
like at Google this was important and

256
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,920
what skills are really necessary to

257
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,560
learn in order to use these tools

258
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,560
effectively yeah so um so we spent a lot

259
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,279
of time talking to organizations about

260
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,120
how's it going uh what are what are you

261
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,440
actually seeing your people do and the

262
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,839
other day I was talking to the head of

263
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,399
AI for a big multinational company and

264
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,519
he basically said I just can't get

265
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,600
people to use it and I was like what do

266
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,079
you mean and he said well people don't

267
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,120
know how to use it so they're basically

268
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,240
treating it like search they're doing a

269
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,079
crappy query they're getting crappy

270
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,360
results and they're going ah it is all

271
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,720
hype and they don't really appreciate

272
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,279
the value so one of the most important

273
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,200
things I think is teaching people to

274
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:48,600
prompt well these tools are amazing when

275
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,480
you know how to use them but it is

276
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,839
garbage in garbage out um and so one of

277
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,000
the things we've created at Google is a

278
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,320
short form course called AI Essentials

279
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,839
um and it teaches you all the basics

280
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,160
what is AI how does it work what do you

281
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,040
have to be careful about and then kind

282
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,600
of the art of prompting um and then we

283
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,200
put that course online and made it

284
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,760
available to everyone because one of our

285
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,959
core principles is that AI can be a

286
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,600
great equalizing technology and I can

287
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:21,680
talk about that in a second um so I have

288
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,040
kind of an evolving mental model of um

289
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,040
how we can get individuals to be

290
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,519
productive in our organizations around

291
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,079
using Ai and because I'm a marketing

292
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:32,720
person I call it the four C's the first

293
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,880
is Clarity do people in your

294
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,839
organization understand what the

295
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,360
parameters and guard rails are around

296
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,920
how they can use this stuff do they know

297
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,680
what information is okay to put in what

298
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:50,040
tool Clarity the second is critical

299
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,839
metrics are you um clear on which

300
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,560
metrics you're going to use to evaluate

301
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,519
success so as you go into building out

302
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,240
these projects everyone knows what

303
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,720
you're shooting for the third is

304
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,120
community how are you helping people

305
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,480
share best practices across the

306
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,480
organization um and the fourth is

307
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,200
credentials so one of the things that I

308
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,480
was talking to this person about was how

309
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,720
do you motivate people to educate

310
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,000
themselves and fortunately or

311
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,839
unfortunately people are a little

312
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,480
motivated by having a credential they

313
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,360
can show for what they've learned they

314
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,199
can put it on their LinkedIn or

315
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,320
internally use it as a badge and so

316
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:27,600
that's why things like our AI Essentials

317
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,240
program are also useful is because

318
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,240
Google is giving you a credential

319
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,880
certifying that you have learned the

320
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,360
basics so I think in in my mind these

321
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,040
four C's are kind of in addition to the

322
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,040
tech and data infrastructure that

323
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,320
they've been talking about kind of the

324
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,480
change management part for getting

325
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,639
people to embrace these tools so did

326
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,079
they sign up to put their people through

327
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:51,320
the course or what was what was the end

328
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:53,120
of the story there yeah so lots of

329
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,560
companies are signing up to use RI

330
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,240
essential City group was actually the

331
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,720
first um company to sign up their whole

332
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,560
organization um so any company can use

333
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,839
it please check it out Google AI

334
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,079
Essentials but also um individuals can

335
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,440
use it so if you're personally

336
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:09,360
interested um all of our courses are

337
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,279
hosted on corsera it's really easy to

338
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,360
find the Google AI Essentials course and

339
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,240
of course we have a whole stack of ways

340
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,560
to learn if you're more advanced or more

341
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,279
technical learner as well and I wonder

342
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,440
at at in in Capital One what has been

343
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,240
the approach to learning have you seen

344
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,480
something similar to this executive like

345
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,959
resistance to I know that there's a

346
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,680
group probably of power users who are

347
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,560
early adopters and excited to use these

348
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,639
tools and then as as we've seen in our

349
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,560
research a majority of people still have

350
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,440
yet to adopt or maybe curious but

351
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:39,000
resistant type attitudes what have been

352
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,160
your experiences you first okay thanks

353
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,480
um I'll say actually it's more about

354
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,040
keeping the floodgates closed so it

355
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,519
there's no there's no lacking of

356
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,720
excitement like there's a tremendous

357
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,759
excitement across the Enterprise whether

358
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,759
you're whether you're a tech associate

359
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,839
or Tech employee or doing other kinds of

360
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,680
jobs like business analysis and stuff

361
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:04,000
like everybody thinks that jobs are

362
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:07,120
going to be transformed uh by AI I will

363
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,880
uh say um uh I agree with the first

364
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,600
point I think you do have to Define what

365
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,160
are your metrics for success or like

366
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,320
what does success look like even if it's

367
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,360
not a metric metrics are pretty hard

368
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,959
right now like take software development

369
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,040
there's a fair amount of debate going on

370
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,199
around what's a real metric is it the

371
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,120
speeding up of the release cycle is it

372
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,720
the shortening of the Agile development

373
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,519
it's just it's not clear that any of

374
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,680
these are clear signals but you want to

375
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,079
have a sense of what success looks like

376
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,360
uh before you start beyond that you also

377
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,480
want to take a look at uh kind of the

378
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,839
state of the Readiness of the different

379
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,759
places along the three things I were

380
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,920
talking about how ready are you

381
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,440
especially on the talent side uh in

382
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,000
terms of absorbing uh some of these

383
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,320
things maybe the highest leverage use

384
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,920
cases are the most complex in some sense

385
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,279
and maybe the way at least the way we've

386
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,320
fashioned it um internally and the way

387
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,040
that I U most comfortable with is to

388
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,959
take a test and learn approach right

389
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,759
like slope your way up right find the

390
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:10,759
things where there's leverage start

391
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:13,360
small bring people into the process by

392
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,199
having small groups of test users bring

393
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,040
their feedback into the design show them

394
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,560
how your design is adapted to their

395
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,040
feedback on the change management piece

396
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,800
change management is not like a it's not

397
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,680
like here's my project plan for change

398
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,639
management it's it's a bit of a cultural

399
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,519
thing as you know and so you have to

400
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,319
build into the cultural values of the

401
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,199
organization that you're in you have to

402
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:36,040
tap into that and say how am I going to

403
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,519
manage this process but no we're not

404
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,440
lacking for excitement in fact we have

405
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,319
to hold back and say let's do the

406
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,759
thoughtful thing

407
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:48,759
here um yeah well in the ing there's a

408
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,720
also a DNA uh thingy so we're always

409
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:53,399
embracing new technologies and want to

410
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,800
be first and want to experiment with it

411
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:59,680
uh we are very agile but specifically on

412
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,519
the autonomy uh part so we love autonomy

413
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,519
not so much alignment so there's a lot

414
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,040
of autonomy around yeah let's experiment

415
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,040
and coming back to George point

416
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,360
yesterday what we need to bring in right

417
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,240
what we are bringing in right now is a

418
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,959
little bit more governance and alignment

419
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,680
on okay now let's join forces and and

420
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:19,680
and really accelerate um and we see a

421
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,759
lot of uh spontaneous

422
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,160
upscaling in in in all aspects you were

423
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:27,440
for referring to the licenses I see it

424
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,319
also are people on LinkedIn I have a

425
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,480
Google license oh I didn't know that you

426
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:36,360
were interested but okay cool uh Gardner

427
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,160
conferences not so much about ceso

428
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,079
whatever you see some applications and

429
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,440
then data analytics everybody wants to

430
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,839
go there so it's it's obviously hype

431
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,800
everybody wants to learn and I would say

432
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:48,839
it's it's also something to embrace and

433
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,959
encourage but with a little bit of

434
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,560
governance and

435
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,399
Alignment you know maybe Ben if I may go

436
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,519
out of cycle just add one thing I'll say

437
00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:01,519
like I think to the extent that we all

438
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,120
believe I think most of us do that the

439
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,000
geni

440
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,439
transformation is going to be an

441
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,360
enduring it's going to be a

442
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,799
transformative force in the long run

443
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,079
it's going to create an enduring

444
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,079
transformation of the business Etc to

445
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,720
that extent I think if we really believe

446
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,280
those things it doesn't go hand inand

447
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,000
with a gold rush mentality that we have

448
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,039
to mine it now if this thing is truly

449
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,520
transformative is truly enduring take

450
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,200
your time think this through figure out

451
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,520
how to do it thoughtfully and resp

452
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,400
responsibly build the scaffolding to

453
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,000
bring everybody along either you or you

454
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,000
think there's all of the competitive

455
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,039
advantages are in the next 6 months and

456
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,640
you have to rush to it so I I think

457
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,520
there's that balance that needs to be

458
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,120
struck like where you say what is my

459
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,360
hypothesis it's a fundamental

460
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,080
transformative Force fine then let's

461
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,600
treat it like one with the respected

462
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,799
deserves approach it with the right uh

463
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,919
mindset that makes sense and one thing

464
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,159
Marco brought up earlier was customer

465
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,400
facing tools you know we can talk about

466
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:02,039
workers and work adoption but I wonder

467
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,159
if customers particular banking

468
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,480
customers are ready for a personalized

469
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,880
experience that is you know influenced

470
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,679
by generative a in my banking experience

471
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,240
that's not necessarily what I'm looking

472
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,559
for and and I wonder if you're seeing

473
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,799
different customer profiles or you know

474
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,679
if customers are looking for this next

475
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,080
Generation technology and how they're

476
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:23,240
engaging with your services well we do

477
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,919
uh we do see the the the differences in

478
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,760
different countries so for example in my

479
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:30,720
home country nland is very let's say

480
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,240
adaptive to new technology so it's it's

481
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,520
99.9% digital uh and they really love

482
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,960
insights insights like this in Germany

483
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,720
perhaps a little bit less it's more on

484
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:45,120
on on sovereignty in Australia bring it

485
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,480
on uh so you see the differences in

486
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,720
countries

487
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,799
but we do have a common Foundation that

488
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,880
we work with or a common data capability

489
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:58,400
Foundation or platform to work with that

490
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,799
and let's say to keep up with the pace

491
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,240
of the respective countries uh and

492
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:06,760
coming back to your earlier question

493
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,600
what is a use case or value case that

494
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,960
hasn't materialized yet as much as I

495
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,000
would love to that is more in the kyc

496
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,159
fraud area uh where I I see a lot of

497
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,320
value in let's let's call it contextual

498
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:24,440
banking bringing all the data that you

499
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,840
can gather to prevent fraud um but for

500
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,320
that we need some sort we had a small

501
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,520
discussion about that we need some sort

502
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,200
of Tim at consent customers aren't there

503
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,919
yet which makes sense the villains they

504
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,240
just take your consent so to prevent

505
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,280
fraud it would be helpful to get all

506
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,520
kind of data in to prevent to prevent

507
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,600
this these fraud

508
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:51,760
schemes uh that is still something that

509
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:55,679
we haven't Harvest uh to the max right

510
00:19:51,760 --> 00:20:00,520
anything else yeah I can um I think um

511
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:03,919
in general uh sloping your way not just

512
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,919
in terms of learning how to scale your

513
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:10,360
application but sloping your way through

514
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:14,559
risk is crucially important especially

515
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,240
in a regulated industry like Finance um

516
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,799
uh there is the Instinct of course let's

517
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,760
just put it out there customers will use

518
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,880
it but you can introduce all kinds of

519
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,760
risks in the system I mean I'm sure all

520
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,640
of you are tracking how these things can

521
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,880
make offers that don't exist or that

522
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,919
offers you can't back up Etc even though

523
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,679
those are not white spread in the case

524
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,039
of banking Finance is so Central to all

525
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:37,080
our lives access to managing our

526
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,320
finances responsibly and enablement of

527
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,000
Finance is so Central to our lives that

528
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,000
we do have that additional burden of

529
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,480
responsibility in the finance industry

530
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,480
to make sure whatever we're putting out

531
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,200
there in front so our approach to

532
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:52,640
sloping the risk in this case is that

533
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,559
pretty much everything we do will be

534
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,960
with a human in the loop to start with

535
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,640
and for the foreseeable future until we

536
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,440
can have the Telemetry and observations

537
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,480
that tell us this is working well enough

538
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,039
here's where we can automate more right

539
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,240
so take customer

540
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:10,520
interactions uh customer interactions

541
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,679
are a huge area of investment for most

542
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,120
companies like ours well you know you're

543
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,320
interacting with customers the daily

544
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,480
transactions Etc so we have a lot of

545
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,720
agent Associates Associates is our term

546
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,240
for employees who interact with the

547
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,200
customers how do you make to me the

548
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,200
noble aim of AI is to transfer the

549
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,200
cognitive burden from the human to the

550
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,200
system

551
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,520
right so my agent Associates have a lot

552
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,880
of cognitive burdens they face when they

553
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,559
have to get information in the moment to

554
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,520
answer a customer query how can we make

555
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:43,480
their lives that much easier that much

556
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,880
simpler while they're helping these

557
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,200
systems while they're leveraging these

558
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,840
systems to help them in their jobs uh

559
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,120
same with software development right

560
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,039
like despite all the predictions um I

561
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,840
think we're trying to bring in these

562
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:58,600
tools to make our software Engineers

563
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,200
more you know focus on the more creative

564
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,960
aspects of their jobs uh try to automate

565
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,880
the more routine aspects like testing

566
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,600
and things like that and some of the uh

567
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,360
boiler plate code generation Etc so I

568
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,240
think that's kind of the sloping I see

569
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,799
like figure out for your particular use

570
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,760
case what is the risk slope and how do

571
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,440
you progressively go up that risk slope

572
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,520
in a responsible way just to follow up

573
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,600
quickly on that because you talked about

574
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,880
Shifting the cognitive burden which I

575
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,120
think could you could interpret in one

576
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,360
of two ways one like you mentioned you

577
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,360
can introduce this tool into your job

578
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,600
and then you could take on more skilled

579
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,360
higher value ad tasks as an individual

580
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,720
maybe that translates into higher pay as

581
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,600
well and we've seen that in some cases

582
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,480
like HR taking over routine interactions

583
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,360
and then having HR workers move into

584
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,640
more critical thinking problem solving

585
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,600
type tasks you could also imagine it if

586
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,760
it takes over your cognitive burden you

587
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,679
end up deskilled in the tasks of

588
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,039
checking the you know whatever the

589
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,039
algorithm's producing to make sure it's

590
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,919
accurate or doing more rote tasks that

591
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,720
the algorithm can't take over yet so I'm

592
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,799
wondering how to guarantee in in this

593
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,120
question to everyone how do we ensure

594
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:05,320
that this is actually creating higher

595
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,600
quality jobs for workers versus just

596
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,760
increasing the

597
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,480
drudgery would you like to go first go

598
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,760
ahead please go um I was actually

599
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,279
thinking you know we've been talking

600
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,080
about very big corporate um highly

601
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:23,200
regulated uh use cases but one of the

602
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:27,640
places that has tons of democratization

603
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,919
I think already um are small businesses

604
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,679
and I think it's a great example of you

605
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,000
know the vast majority of small

606
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:38,120
businesses in our country are um sole

607
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,919
Proprietors it's a one person show right

608
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,799
80 plus percent of them um and if you

609
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,799
think of all the drudgery tasks that go

610
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,320
into running a small business you can

611
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:51,080
take AI you can create an entire new

612
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,799
product line overnight you can name it

613
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,360
you can come up with a logo you can come

614
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,120
up with a tagline you can come up with a

615
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,360
marketing plan A business plan a

616
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:02,400
promotional plan a targeting plan in AI

617
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,640
in a very very short period of time in a

618
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,600
day call it maybe less in a way that you

619
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,559
could never do before as like a small

620
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,720
business owner so I also think we've

621
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,679
been talking about very corporate

622
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,760
examples probably that's resonant with

623
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,240
most of the audience here but if you

624
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,080
think about drudgery versus empowerment

625
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,559
there's all these additional use cases

626
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,799
that I think is are just worth

627
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:25,960
mentioning where all these things you

628
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:28,120
could not have found even the time to do

629
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,000
as an entrepreneur and now it does it

630
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:34,440
with you human in the loop um to empower

631
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,880
you to you know expand your product line

632
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,880
and do more in your business than you

633
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,480
could ever do before I think that's also

634
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:45,200
an interesting um use

635
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,559
case um yeah in general what we see is

636
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,159
in indeed it offers a lot of benefits uh

637
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,200
which which are valued so for example

638
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,600
you for our developers it takes away

639
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,360
some of the heavy lifting not only AI

640
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,399
takes away lot of heavy lifting also

641
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,440
marketplaces or Plug and Play kind of

642
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:04,840
kind of

643
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,000
tooling as a result their time to Market

644
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,880
uh massively improves which they love so

645
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
they there are better things that come

646
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,799
to life and they have all kind of

647
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,520
analytics to see okay this is really

648
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,799
working let's let's do some uh some

649
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,000
further AB testing so basically they get

650
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:22,000
more out of their work that's the good

651
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,200
the good side of it and we also see that

652
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,640
let's say in our marketing area so they

653
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,799
can really play with the numbers instead

654
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,039
of writing a text basically I'm

655
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:34,159
exaggerating a little bit that's what we

656
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:36,480
see happening on the one side what we

657
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,799
what we what we also see at the a very

658
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,720
same moment is that there's uh we had

659
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:43,840
the discussion also before for example

660
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,080
for our talents that just come out of

661
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,480
University I think it was also topic

662
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:52,640
yesterday normally or typically you give

663
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,880
them the easy work to gain some

664
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,039
experience and then move on there's

665
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,880
there's not a lot of easy work around

666
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,080
anymore so how do you educate let's say

667
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,480
your new uh you're new to the company

668
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,039
people that is a bit of a of a challenge

669
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,240
and especially in that area we see some

670
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,640
challenges not so much with the let's

671
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,559
say the the current

672
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:18,120
Workforce yeah you on this is I mean

673
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,200
there are two aspects of this one is uh

674
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,360
the intensity of your concern on that

675
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,200
fund it depends on which articles you

676
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,640
read right um and which which uh

677
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,120
thinkers you follow there's one end

678
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,200
where that says AGI is already

679
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:37,679
here the actual codes right from people

680
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,880
we all know to um people thinking it's

681
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,559
out there 2 to three years away all the

682
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,279
way to somebody like Yan who will say

683
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,880
there's no human with AGI why do we

684
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:49,039
think systems will have AGI right so

685
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,000
there's a whole Spectrum here my view

686
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:55,320
you know grounded in the Here and Now of

687
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
these things is that um and also I said

688
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,480
it transfers cognitive burdens not the

689
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,080
cognitive joys my view is we enjoy the

690
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,440
creative aspects of our world I think

691
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,799
that requires reasoning that requires

692
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,159
planning now you can read some things

693
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,600
that say all of these things are

694
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,320
happening but then when you start

695
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,679
actually trying them out you know

696
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,159
there's a difference between something

697
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,600
working sometimes well enough to kind of

698
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,760
grab our attention and say hey this is

699
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,240
coming sometime in the future versus

700
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,960
this is here and now and I can use this

701
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,640
at scale and it's good enough and

702
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,880
reliable enough and people can count on

703
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:28,679
it that's uh that's one uh one the other

704
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,360
part is for the most uh in most cases is

705
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,159
is definitely true where uh I'm working

706
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,679
right

707
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,720
now

708
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,600
are we're not lacking for ideas or

709
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,640
products that we want to develop our

710
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,640
biggest uh limitation is the bandwidth

711
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,679
of the resources we have so every year

712
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,640
our list of things that we want to do is

713
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:53,840
growing it's not shrinking so when I

714
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,480
look at it from that if this allows me

715
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,080
to limit the rate of growth of that list

716
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,399
uh by using using technology to

717
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:03,720
accelerate that development that just

718
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:05,600
allows us to accelerate the speed with

719
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,840
which we can provide services and value

720
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:12,159
to our customers and our Associates so I

721
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:14,720
don't necessarily there is a zero some

722
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,279
view of it which is different the way

723
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,679
we're working I don't see it we're still

724
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:21,240
hiring we're still not able to keep up

725
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:22,720
with all that we want to do technology

726
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,240
better help us because otherwise we're

727
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,799
going to continue to fall

728
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,840
behind and just to to follow up you know

729
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,159
we this is is something consistent with

730
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,399
what we've heard from a lot of companies

731
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,000
that this isn't necessarily um Zero Sum

732
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:36,640
where you're trying to reduce headcount

733
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,399
to solve the same number of problems

734
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,080
instead it's enabling you to solve more

735
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,480
problems with the res do more with the

736
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,840
same or more with more um one question I

737
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,720
have about the ways that you're

738
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,679
deploying these tools um you could

739
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,399
imagine you're deploying these tools in

740
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,559
a way that is top down that has kind of

741
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,559
Executives choosing High leverage use

742
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:59,600
cases and then asking individuals to to

743
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:01,640
use them this particular way and kind of

744
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,919
narrowing individual discretion and then

745
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,440
we've seen some companies do a very

746
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:07,159
bottom-up approach where they give an

747
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,760
internal version of a let's say a chat

748
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:11,080
GPT to the individuals so that they can

749
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,720
use it as they wish and then they can

750
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,600
track use cases to understand which are

751
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,760
the most effective I wonder how you see

752
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,519
the trade-offs of these different

753
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,519
approaches in in your organizations and

754
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,559
and what you've seen effective in in

755
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:26,080
different contexts you want us to

756
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:28,559
talk I can share an anecdote is it

757
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,320
recorded okay let's see uh

758
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,159
um I think you signed away the right

759
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:36,120
otherwise I will apply as Capital One it

760
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,080
was

761
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,679
uh was it that was already last year of

762
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,279
course with the with the Big Fuzz about

763
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:46,039
Chad DPT 10 10 billion so I got a call

764
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,919
from the board asking Marco are we

765
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:51,480
missing out why do you think we're

766
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,799
missing out ah there's a big thing going

767
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,919
on and we're missing out well at the

768
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,679
very same moment there was a was also a

769
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:01,919
survey in the financial t

770
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:04,720
times banks that are doing the most with

771
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,399
or are fur the furthest with with their

772
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:12,399
development of of AI in was globally on

773
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:14,360
number seven so so I replied apparently

774
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,799
the outside world actually think that

775
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,760
we're doing quite a lot already but

776
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,440
let's let's let's give some context to

777
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,120
it and some educational stuff so

778
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,320
including the supervisory board and said

779
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,679
okay this is what we are doing already

780
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,240
because we have we have attracted great

781
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:32,559
talent that are let's say that that are

782
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,640
open to fur to new developments they are

783
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,640
simply getting out there getting this

784
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:41,080
knowledge implementing testing it this

785
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,799
is what we already have so at least

786
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,919
within Ing and perhaps partly uh uh

787
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:48,080
because of our DNA and we're open for

788
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,559
new technologies it was already

789
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,240
happening before actually the board

790
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,440
became aware of it so I I really do

791
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,320
encourage this this this learning and

792
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,600
this experimentation this part of the

793
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,880
agility the autonomy part just go out

794
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,639
learn and at a certain moment put some

795
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,000
governance alignment on it otherwise it

796
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:12,279
will really go ballistic but uh at least

797
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,840
within in it was a bottomup

798
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:17,480
approach i' say I think

799
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,039
um I always hate it when somebody says

800
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,080
both but I I am going to say both and

801
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:25,240
but I I hopefully I'll articulate why

802
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,760
and it's it's concrete

803
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,720
um it all starts with finding out where

804
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,399
is is the maximum leverage in your

805
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,360
company or in your in your industry or

806
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:36,559
in your business some of those areas of

807
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,720
Leverage especially maximum leverage

808
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,279
take software development which

809
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,320
everybody's aligned huge leverage there

810
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:47,600
those end up being cross cutting across

811
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,000
the company things doing bottom up

812
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,240
doesn't really help you don't want like

813
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,120
six different Sol if you have if you're

814
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,360
a if you're a company that's practicing

815
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,840
software development uh as it should be

816
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:02,039
you have one as TLC framework software

817
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,000
development life cycle framework you

818
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,240
have one set of tools that allow you to

819
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,320
go all the way from planning and design

820
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,600
to development to testing to moving into

821
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,919
production and then post- production

822
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,159
monitoring and everything you want to

823
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,639
have an sdlc that's integrated you don't

824
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,000
want everybody to be going and getting

825
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:18,679
it because that actually makes your

826
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,080
systems less secure less maintainable

827
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:24,039
increases cost Beyond uh sustainable

828
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,480
limits Etc there are other areas where

829
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:27,240
there are a lot of people practicing

830
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,760
things like you know there's a business

831
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,039
analyst who's working on certain things

832
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,080
or all the reporting you were talking

833
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:33,320
about and those reports are so stylized

834
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,600
different Regulators want different

835
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,679
types of reports they are asking

836
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,120
different types of questions there is

837
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:41,120
really no le so what is the leverage

838
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,760
there The Leverage there is in providing

839
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,840
a set of platforms and tools that people

840
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,639
can most easily develop applications and

841
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,200
customize them for their if they have to

842
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:53,159
do it from scratch it's too hard that's

843
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,360
where the platform story comes in so one

844
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:56,639
you have platforms as Solutions the

845
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,760
other is where you have platforms as

846
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:01,279
building blocks and that platform as a

847
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,519
building block is where the bottom up

848
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,799
thing becomes uh that's what enables the

849
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,880
bottomup development we have tremendous

850
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,440
number of use cases in development right

851
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,720
now we know every single use case that

852
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,120
is in development because we have a

853
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,440
central use case review and approval uh

854
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,159
mechanism regulated industry you have to

855
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,559
do it Regulators will come and ask tell

856
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,320
us all the use cases you have to be able

857
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:24,760
to produce a list and show them the

858
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,279
other hand that also makes sure

859
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,039
everybody's thinking about things in the

860
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:30,440
same way that eventually when you have

861
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:32,880
an Enterprise that is very AI

862
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,720
transformed the look and feel and the

863
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,080
experience they're all seamless so I

864
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,039
think it's it so I'll just say it's both

865
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,000
but hopefully I gave you exact and I

866
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,080
think it might come up in a different

867
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,559
context when you're working with small

868
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,720
businesses or or

869
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,880
entrepreneurs yeah I was just um I was

870
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,840
also just thinking about some of the

871
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,279
surprising use cases so the other day I

872
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,279
was reading about one of the things that

873
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,440
Walmart is doing um so they they

874
00:33:54,279 --> 00:34:01,200
actually created a bot as I understand

875
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,840
it to NE negotiate with with vendors so

876
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,600
um this is obviously everyone wants to

877
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:09,119
sell their stuff at Walmart um and

878
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,919
that's a bandwidth constrained thing so

879
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,040
they actually made a bot that negotiated

880
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:17,800
with vendors um as an experiment so you

881
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,200
could um you know pitch your idea to the

882
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,800
bot and the bot would negotiate with you

883
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,359
and their results were that people

884
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,399
preferred negotiating with the bot over

885
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:29,720
negotiating with people and essentially

886
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:33,159
Walmart still got the same high quality

887
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,520
deals out of it and if if you had

888
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,560
thought about this you would never have

889
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,839
imagined either that it would work as

890
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,359
well or that people would be as

891
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:42,919
satisfied negotiating with a bot right

892
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,280
so I do think also there's these

893
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:46,760
interesting use cases that people

894
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,359
wouldn't have thought of or wouldn't

895
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,480
think would work that we're all going to

896
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:54,560
discover over time are actually um kind

897
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,599
of fascinating so um it's good to be an

898
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,920
observer and see like what are all the

899
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,440
things that other people are doing it

900
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,800
might spark also creative new ideas well

901
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,200
and to follow up on that it's always

902
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,040
exciting to be at a university because

903
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,160
you're in learning mode but what is

904
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,560
great about the university convening

905
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,960
folks like yourselves is I feel like

906
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,480
we've all been in learning mode for the

907
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,640
last 18 months or so and being able to

908
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,680
share experiences like this is is really

909
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,839
exciting one of the surprises that that

910
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,359
we got we recently did a survey of about

911
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,880
9,000 workers in in nine different

912
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:27,079
countries and we thought you know

913
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,200
consistent with some observations that

914
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,960
um those most optimistic about tools

915
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,160
like generative AI would be highly

916
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,640
educated knowledge workers but actually

917
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,280
people without a college degree were

918
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,920
more optimistic about the benefits for

919
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,359
their work than college degree holders

920
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,000
so maybe you know last question for you

921
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,960
before we head to some of the questions

922
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,240
from the audience is how do you see kind

923
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:52,880
of uh the the jobs that are most open to

924
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,880
to change the types of jobs within your

925
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,640
um communities you know there's some

926
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,200
economists a big hypothesis being that

927
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,280
this will be a skill leveler more

928
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,000
beneficial for low skilled low wage jobs

929
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,680
and we really see mixed evidence that

930
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,240
for some expert developers it seems to

931
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,319
be a superpower whereas for junior

932
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:10,920
developers might be harder to use um I

933
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:13,400
wonder how that shakes out in your

934
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,680
experiences well I don't have empiric

935
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,599
evidence here but what what what we do

936
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,119
see happening is I think you touched

937
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,720
upon that as

938
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,079
well the the the number of fases are

939
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,000
actually Rising so we need more people

940
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,400
perhaps a little bit more in in the data

941
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,359
area obviously but also work with that

942
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,040
you see some spontaneous upskilling of

943
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:37,400
people and perhaps in that indeed even

944
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:41,440
in the what you might call lower skilled

945
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:43,760
areas but somehow it's now much easier

946
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,880
to keep up with the pace because we we

947
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,560
also deliver some tools to actually

948
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,640
apply it so it's not not only having the

949
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,760
the AI knowledge but we also provide the

950
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,560
tools working with that and in doing so

951
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,400
uh learn learn some new techniques or

952
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:02,440
skills here so at least from although

953
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:05,359
it's indeed not not scientifically

954
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:09,400
proven but I do see see some upskilling

955
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:11,760
of of lower lower skilled jobs yeah okay

956
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,440
so I'd like to democratize here to the

957
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,760
to the audience and allow each of you to

958
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,760
pick uh you know we we can go around at

959
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,079
least once a question that you find you

960
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,400
most interesting from this um this

961
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:29,079
audience uh collection

962
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,079
system Lisa do you want to start

963
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,599
can you scan that down a little bit to I

964
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:38,240
can take the one about uh

965
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:41,599
education great um so I think education

966
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,160
is a really fascinating um AI use case

967
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,599
and I'll take two different parts of it

968
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,640
um so one is I want to talk about

969
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,480
teachers um as we all know um there was

970
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,720
kind of

971
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:58,440
a panic in the world of Education around

972
00:37:53,720 --> 00:38:01,920
um AI as a cheating tool and um it made

973
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:06,280
teachers and and parents and others uh

974
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,000
quite um anti- AI for a period of time

975
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,040
um which I think actually did a real

976
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,800
disservice both to the educational

977
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,800
system and to teachers themselves and

978
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,599
what we see now even in our search query

979
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,480
data at Google we look at queries that

980
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,560
start with AI for blank and actually AI

981
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,599
for teachers is now one of the top

982
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,520
queries on on

983
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,560
ai4 on Google and this is because

984
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,200
teachers are starting to realize that if

985
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,800
students understand something at a

986
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,240
minimum they need to understand it too

987
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,240
and they're just starting to realize

988
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,400
what a powerful tool it can actually be

989
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,240
for a teacher so one of the courses

990
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,839
we've created is Gen AI for educators

991
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,920
and it's a course specifically for

992
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:52,599
teachers to learn how to use

993
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:55,760
AI um because actually AI can be a

994
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:58,079
really incredible teaching assistant I

995
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,079
just give a few quick examples

996
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,119
a teacher could take their lesson plan

997
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,400
say a science lesson and say help me

998
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,240
teach this lesson this science lesson

999
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,480
using Sports analogies and the AI will

1000
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,119
craft a a way that that teacher can do

1001
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,560
that to meet students where they are you

1002
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,520
could take your lesson plan for a

1003
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,000
certain age group and convert it to

1004
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,800
different reading levels or different

1005
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,400
levels of understanding take the entire

1006
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,160
week's lessons and summarize it for the

1007
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,079
kid who was out sick write the class

1008
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,480
newsletter on and on and on it's

1009
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,440
actually an outstanding uh tool for

1010
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,280
teachers and actually we built our

1011
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,760
teacher course with MIT with a

1012
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,599
responsible AI in society and Education

1013
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,240
team and I think um we're going to see

1014
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:43,760
it be a really powerful tool for

1015
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,640
teachers um and for learning but I also

1016
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,280
think what we're realizing in society

1017
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,400
more broadly and even beyond the AI use

1018
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,200
case is that there is absolutely no way

1019
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,720
that all of us will be able to learn

1020
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,000
everything we need to know for our

1021
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,760
careers in the Years we're in school or

1022
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,760
in College we are way past the point in

1023
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,839
society where at whatever 22 years old

1024
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,280
you've learned everything you're going

1025
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,599
to need to know and people are going to

1026
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,040
need to be constantly

1027
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:13,040
reskilling um that's one of the reasons

1028
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,000
we created the Google career certificate

1029
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,200
program is so that people could easily

1030
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,520
change careers and make pivots so we'll

1031
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,520
teach you to become a data analyst Marco

1032
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,520
was talking about the vast need for data

1033
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,040
analytics or to be a cyber security

1034
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,440
analyst or an IT support professional

1035
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,280
and you can do it all online on demand

1036
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,920
and this is the way I think people will

1037
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,200
res skill in the future um working

1038
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,680
people need ways they can access real

1039
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,200
training when they have time it has to

1040
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,400
be available to them and so all of our

1041
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,839
Google career certificates are therefore

1042
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,440
online on demand and allow you to Res

1043
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:51,319
skill into these professions in a pretty

1044
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,920
straightforward way learning from Google

1045
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:54,640
experts and giving you as I was

1046
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,119
mentioning before a real credential you

1047
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:01,160
can you can point to

1048
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:02,920
and the the first or the one on top uh

1049
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,880
organizations are never ready for for

1050
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:08,680
Change Is Never necessary to create a

1051
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,720
sense of urgency definitely

1052
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:15,640
not I would rather say uh start thinking

1053
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:17,839
beyond the hype uh uh uh and and put

1054
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,920
some some more perspectives to it like

1055
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:23,400
having a value based approach to it uh

1056
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:27,280
because the let's say AI on itself

1057
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:29,400
doesn't deliver that much value you and

1058
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,839
we had that discussion yesterday what

1059
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,040
problems are we solving here what

1060
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,800
business are out there are the new

1061
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:37,920
business or new business models and and

1062
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:41,079
how can it can iI enable this uh are you

1063
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,079
ready as a as a company to even start

1064
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:44,640
thinking about it or working on it or do

1065
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:46,599
you have some other problems to solve

1066
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,400
first so it's not so much a sense of

1067
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:52,520
urgency uh people do want to change uh

1068
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,960
they do like to embrace it but hold your

1069
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,319
horses a bit uh uh it's it's not the

1070
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,119
holy Grill and you really need to have

1071
00:41:57,319 --> 00:42:01,800
your act together so it's perhaps uh the

1072
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:04,079
opposite

1073
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:05,680
great says you're looking Prem we have

1074
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,160
one uh organization we've been working

1075
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,280
with that um is doing exercises uh with

1076
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,040
learning about generative AI realizing

1077
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,440
that they might need to abandon whatever

1078
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,040
applications they build because there'll

1079
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,800
be a vendor that can do it better in six

1080
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:21,839
months so that for them it's maybe the

1081
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,520
option isn't to wait and just hold on

1082
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,359
entirely it's to keep learning but

1083
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,400
recognize that you might need to change

1084
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,119
what you're doing as as you learn the

1085
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,040
technology evolves but I think your

1086
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,200
point is really well taken that urgency

1087
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,000
doesn't seem helpful in in this case yes

1088
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,040
I'm going to present a challenge for

1089
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,079
your presenters I'm going to pick the

1090
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,000
most popular remaining question but also

1091
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:45,599
the one about four big areas of impact

1092
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,559
because I think I see ativity there so I

1093
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,920
want to see say it out for the I want to

1094
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:50,839
see if you can actually show two

1095
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,240
questions at once on your screen that's

1096
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:56,520
the challenge here if not maybe that's

1097
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,800
the next AI generated U ux that uh you

1098
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,599
can go for

1099
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:03,800
um but you know this whole thing I'll

1100
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,599
focus on that four big areas of impact

1101
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,400
I'll start with the secret source for I

1102
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,720
think the generic business processes

1103
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,480
radical transformation personal

1104
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,559
productivity radical transformation is

1105
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,040
not a category of its own in in other

1106
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:16,599
sense it's a horizontal that we're going

1107
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,640
to radically transform the other three

1108
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:20,920
areas generic business processes secret

1109
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,720
Source personal productivity a software

1110
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:25,440
development is about as generic a

1111
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,640
business process as you can get and and

1112
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,280
the reason we're seeing a lot of

1113
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,800
progress there is because there's just

1114
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,160
so much code available in open source

1115
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,880
which means there's so much training

1116
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,319
data that's available this is the

1117
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,839
connection I was seeing with the garbage

1118
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:39,520
in garbage

1119
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:42,359
out it's a lot of code and a lot of good

1120
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,880
code we now know there's a lot of

1121
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:46,640
emerging literature showing that more

1122
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,359
important than perhaps the sheer volume

1123
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,559
of data is the quality the cleanliness

1124
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,119
of the data the relevance of the data so

1125
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:56,359
whatever you call Quality is making a

1126
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:59,359
bigger difference to the performance of

1127
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:01,800
AI systems now uh than the sheer uh

1128
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:03,839
volumes uh in fact most of the best

1129
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,800
performing things all of us use have

1130
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,440
invested disproportionately in improving

1131
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:10,240
cleaning the data that they're using to

1132
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,880
train to get some of these advances and

1133
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,960
so the secret Source in a data and AI

1134
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,240
Enterprise and you know Ali who leads

1135
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,760
data Brooks often say every company of

1136
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,559
the future is going to be a data and AI

1137
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,400
company and the secret Source what is

1138
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:27,880
our secret Source our secret source is

1139
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,280
really the data that we have have that

1140
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:31,359
represents our interactions with our

1141
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,960
customers what do our customers want how

1142
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,240
do we support them best what are their

1143
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,480
intents and needs how do we serve those

1144
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:41,359
best Etc if that's kind of the key

1145
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,000
ingredient of the secret Source then you

1146
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,920
have to have a data operation that

1147
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,640
ensures that you have high quality

1148
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,680
complete data that you can then use to

1149
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,440
train your AI so I do think when I look

1150
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,119
at destination a few years down the road

1151
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,599
the biggest transformation is going to

1152
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:59,520
be that the company companies who can

1153
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,640
use their proprietary data to create

1154
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,720
proprietary AI that differentiates their

1155
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:07,119
services from what others in their

1156
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,079
industry are able to uh offer that's one

1157
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,960
part of it there's also a part where

1158
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:12,800
generic business processes are going to

1159
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,480
those are going to be table Stakes

1160
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,720
everybody better be using all of these

1161
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,920
things for the generic business

1162
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,760
processes otherwise you're going to

1163
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,960
create negative differentiation for

1164
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,920
yourself simply because the crowd is

1165
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,000
moving ahead of you in general and and

1166
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,920
for all of these I think it's important

1167
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,520
for the quality of data uh to be good

1168
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,520
and from the end user perspective I

1169
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,319
think they really two things if you need

1170
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,480
to use prompting or in context learning

1171
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:38,680
to improve performance that's a

1172
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,079
diminishing number of use cases because

1173
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,800
performance out of the box will continue

1174
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:44,319
to become better for places where it's

1175
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,920
just the in context learning from

1176
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,319
prompt-based tuning that helps I don't

1177
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,359
think that's necessarily going to be

1178
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:52,000
huge but the place where it will help is

1179
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:54,119
where you have to really tune with your

1180
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
data great and I think that's a

1181
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,960
wonderful place to leave it and and just

1182
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,800
a common theme Here here about how

1183
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,920
organizations and individuals are are

1184
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,839
climbing the learning curve and just it

1185
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,440
aligns with this new data set that we

1186
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:07,079
have that shows that workers who are

1187
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,400
most motivated by learning and upward

1188
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:10,680
Mobility are also the most open to using

1189
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,400
these sorts of tools and see them as

1190
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:15,599
beneficial in their work so um a big

1191
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,359
thanks to Lisa Marco PR for for joining

1192
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,920
us today and sharing their experience

1193
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,920
thank you thank you
