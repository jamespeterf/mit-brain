00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,620
Hello, everyone, and welcome
to the 2024 Gardner lecture.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,650
I'm Julie Shah.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,380
I'm the department
head here at AeroAstro.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,660
This Gardner lecture
is made possible

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,660
by the bequest of the
late major Lester D.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,570
Gardner, a member of
the MIT class of 1898

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,010
to sponsor annual presentations
on aeronautical history.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,980
An officer in World
War I, Major Gardner

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,660
was the recipient of
numerous aeronautical awards,

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,740
including the Daniel
Guggenheim Medal in 1947,

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,620
given for outstanding
achievement

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,220
in advancing aeronautics.

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,720
He had a long and storied career
establishing a publishing group

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,940
responsible for four
aeronautical trade

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,490
publications, including the
predecessor of Aviation Week.

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,290
He was also a founder
of the Institute

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,290
of aeronautical sciences,
which would eventually

19
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,600
evolve into today's AIAA.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,030
Major Gardner's interest
in MIT and our department

21
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,920
continued throughout
his life and lives

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,270
on not only in the memory
of the Gardner lectureship,

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,670
but also the Hunsaker
professorship,

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,460
which he helped to establish.

25
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,560
Over the years, our
Gardner lecturers

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,430
have included Grover Loaning,
Igor Sikorsky, Yvonne Brill,

27
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,190
Neil Armstrong,
Robert Stevens, Jr.,

28
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:22,010
Gwen Shotwell, John Langford,
and Pam Melroy, to name a few.

29
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,610
This year, we are honored and
excited to welcome four speakers

30
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,300
to deliver the Gardner lecture.

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,630
These are four
core 16 alumni, who

32
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,520
have gone on to become leaders
and innovators in their field.

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,700
Together, they decided
to give a joint lecture

34
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,030
on a very specific topic,
which they are calling aviation

35
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,440
in the age of John Hansman.

36
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,950
Our John Hansman, Jr., is the
Wilson Professor of Aeronautics

37
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,100
and Astronautics.

38
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,280
He directs the International
Center for Air Transportation,

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,280
as well as the laboratory for
aviation and the environment.

40
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,950
Over the course of his
40-plus year career,

41
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,670
John has contributed to the
field of aviation in a myriad

42
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,910
of ways, through research and
technical papers, new patents,

43
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,290
and novel approaches.

44
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,480
But perhaps his greatest
contribution to the field

45
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,060
has been through his mentorship
of entire generations

46
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,340
of academic and
industry leaders.

47
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,259
Our Gardener lecturers
wanted to give us

48
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,870
a sense of John's tremendous
sphere of influence,

49
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,000
his impact on modern
aeronautical history

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,550
through their own expertise.

51
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,540
So a few words about
our speakers before I

52
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,280
turn it over to them.

53
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Amy Pritchett is the Department
head of aerospace engineering

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,060
at Penn State University.

55
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,180
Her research focuses
on the interaction

56
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,090
of technology, humans,
and safety in dynamic time

57
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,078
critical and safety
critical environments,

58
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:33,870
including human-robot
interaction and space

59
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,790
exploration, human
autonomy, teeming

60
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,150
and aviation, novel flight deck
designs and manual control.

61
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,630
Craig Wenke is a chief engineer
for the Miter Corporation's

62
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,480

Aviation Systems Development

63
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,810
and editor-in-chief of the
Journal of Air Transportation.

64
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,790
Among his
accomplishments include

65
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,520
leading the development,
field testing, and technology

66
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,010
transfer of several
capabilities now deployed

67
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,620
as a part of the FAA's
operational traffic flow

68
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,830
management system.

69
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:03,400
He is an AIAA fellow.

70
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,030
John Paul Clark is a professor
of aerospace engineering

71
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,070
and engineering mechanics
at the University

72
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,010
of Texas at Austin, where
he holds the Ernest Cockrell

73
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,940
junior memorial
chair in engineering.

74
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,340
He's an expert in
the development

75
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,100
of the use of stochastic models
and optimization algorithms

76
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,130
to improve the efficiency and
robustness of complex systems

77
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,710
with a particular
focus on aviation.

78
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,040
And Brian Yutko is the
chief executive officer

79
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,150
of Wisk Aero, a leader in the
advanced air mobility market.

80
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,070
His focus is on electric
and autonomous aviation.

81
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,880
Prior to joining Wisk, Brian
served in numerous leadership

82
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,230
roles at Boeing and
Aurora Flight Sciences,

83
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,500
managing various rapid
prototyping and autonomous

84
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,540
technology development programs.

85
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,540
Thank you very much.

86
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,296
And with that, I'll
turn it over to Amy.

87
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:49,761
[APPLAUSE]

88
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:57,650

89
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,390
Thank you, Julie, and thank you
to the Department of AeroAstro.

90
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,380
It is a pleasure to be
back and have a chance

91
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,290
to give this storied lecture.

92
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,750
Indeed, I have to
multitask, and I

93
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,510
have 15 minutes
to do it in that I

94
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,360
want to reflect the spirit
of the Gardner lecture

95
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,760
with a historical perspective.

96
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,300
I would like to stay technical,
as my former advisor taught

97
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,440
me to do, and focus on the
important technical aspects

98
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,800
in aviation safety.

99
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,010
And in doing so,
I think we'll see

100
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,160
that there is a common theme to
the presentation, a name that

101
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,610
keeps recurring in
what I will reflect on

102
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,570
as major achievements
in aviation safety.

103
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,590
So with this quick historical
perspective, looking back

104
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,820
to 1959, looking at the accident
record of jet air transport

105
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,090
aircraft, the numbers have now--

106
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,680
safety is hard to define.

107
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,220
We don't measure safety.

108
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,800
We measure the
opposite, accidents.

109
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,060
And the accident rate has
gone down to the point

110
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,140
that I think we can
argue the Civil Air

111
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,850
transportation in
the Western world

112
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,890
is the safest system ever,
definitely the safest

113
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,160
transportation system.

114
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,570
But right now, I'm ready to
take on nuclear power as well.

115
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:20,840
But to achieve this, to achieve
the level of safety that

116
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,980
is reflected with such a
profound reduction in accident

117
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,950
rates, requires several
different approaches.

118
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:33,750
And the historic approach was to
focus on single point failures,

119
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,530
make certain that you didn't
have some unwitting accident.

120
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:41,550
And looking back
through aviation safety,

121
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,140
we have those flashbulb
moments, those accidents

122
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,370
that we in the discipline
remember profoundly

123
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,850
and that the entire
industry used

124
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,940
to drive our new
insights as they

125
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,180
reflected what was going wrong.

126
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,820
For me, perhaps the first
snap bulb industry--

127
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,190
and one that's really important
to this more modern age--

128
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,430
was United flight
232 in July of 1989,

129
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,470
where the fan disk
in engine number two,

130
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,460
which was mounted in the tail,
right above where the three

131
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,880
hydraulic lines all joined
together, needed to power

132
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,690
the control surfaces.

133
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,480
Well, the fan disk blew.

134
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,500
And while there were many things
leading up to the fan disk

135
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,200
blowing apart and blowing
through the hydraulic lines,

136
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,200
it in the end highlighted
that at that instant,

137
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,340
in flight, given you
had a fan disk that

138
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,690
had design and maintenance
issues that in flight, we

139
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,280
had a single point failure.

140
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,740
Now, I particularly
recall this because I

141
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,120
was a freshman in what was then
called the MIT Aeronautical

142
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,300
Systems Lab.

143
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,170
We gathered around this
thing called the TV

144
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,080
and watched live
news to watch it.

145
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,530
And the McDonnell Douglas
engineer who was briefing CNN

146
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,250
was holding a schematic and
pointing everything out.

147
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,560
And his Brass Rat
was going up and down

148
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,010
in front of the national
news as he described

149
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,020
just how we had
gotten to the point

150
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,800
that one single failure could
make an airplane-- well,

151
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,540
at the time, they said it should
have been considered unflyable.

152
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,870
The second lesson that we
learned that day is that we,

153
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,330
in many cases, safety ends up
being a factor also of people

154
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,360
being able to come together
and work together in new ways,

155
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,640
for Denny Fitch to run back from
his passenger seat and be able

156
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,410
to work the throttles while the
crew already in the flight deck

157
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,830
flew around a while, learning
to fly the airplane only with

158
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,940
differential thrust and elevator
trim to the point that they had

159
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,950
something roughly approximating
a landing and something where we

160
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,550
would have expected
everyone to not survive,

161
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,380
to instead have 2/3
of the people survive.

162
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,080
And this accident, we look
back then on both lessons,

163
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,320
the single point
failure, but also

164
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,260
the role in the crew
on figuring things out.

165
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,680
Now we'll go forward
a little bit more--

166
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,630
1995, the Cali accident.

167
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:27,000
An American Airlines 757
was en route from Miami,

168
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,840
descending down
to land into Cali.

169
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,970
It's a tricky approach.

170
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,820
You can see on the
left the terrain

171
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,730
where you would have to
descend down into the valley

172
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,780
to line up on the final approach
to the land roughly to the south

173
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,710
here.

174
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:47,370
And unfortunately, the
autoflight system tried to--

175
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,610
apparently thought it
could fly through granite.

176
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,190
There was no terrain information
available to the pilots.

177
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,790
And as I will talk
about a bit more later,

178
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,820
there's also a
question of just what

179
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,040
was available to the
pilot for interpreting

180
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,760
where their autoflight system
was going to take them.

181
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,170
Now, this accident was in 1995,
and one of the principal things

182
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,150
that was called out was the lack
of terrain situational awareness

183
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,840
for the pilots--

184
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,540
1995 accident.

185
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,040
1993 study by
Koocher and Hansman

186
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,000
looking at terrain
situational awareness,

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,630
developing those
fundamental insights needed

188
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,120
for Don Boutwell at
Honeywell and others

189
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,000
to really develop the enhanced
ground proximity warning

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,450
system so that as the industry
recovered from this accident,

191
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,250
they were able to say, but
there is a technical solution

192
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,540
that we can implement.

193
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,050

194
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,220
So it was this
study in building 37

195
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,490
in a part task simulator cobbled
together with IRIX machines

196
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:04,980
that I view as one of those key
moments around the industry,

197
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,890
looking at what is
possible in 1993

198
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,420
and being positioned when we
actually had the accident in '95

199
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,240
to step in and to say
we have solutions.

200
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,450
And with this, here's the
data on jet aircraft accidents

201
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,780
for the period
1991 through 2000.

202
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,050
It's divided, each
bar representing

203
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,900
a different category
of the major descriptor

204
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,510
of the type of accident.

205
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,730
In this case, look at the
two big bars that we had

206
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,330
in the 1990s.

207
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:47,840
The leading types of accidents,
loss of control and next to it

208
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,430
CFIT, Controlled
Flight Into Terrain.

209
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,570
And the Cali accident
is a major part

210
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,630
of that big bar
of the fatalities

211
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,730
that we were seeing
because pilots

212
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,010
couldn't tell where the airplane
was going relative to terrain.

213
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:09,350
Let's skim forward to the most
recent set of data that I have,

214
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,930
2013 to 2022.

215
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,640
Can you find CFIT on there?

216
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,700
It's down there.

217
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,660
It's down in the noise.

218
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,420
It's one of those small bars.

219
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,770
And so we can see cases
where some of these advances,

220
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,850
we can point to as having
such profound impact,

221
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,130
like the enhanced ground
proximity warning system.

222
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,870

223
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,710
That's the good news.

224
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,880
The bad news is that how do you
make a system safer than this?

225
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,440
How do you address the more
complex and interrelated

226
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,560
accidents?

227
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,490
For this, I would
put out that you

228
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,460
have to do many things
all at the same time.

229
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,490
As engineers, we
normally start by looking

230
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,610
at the single point
failures, so the reliability

231
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,570
and redundancy, the fault tree.

232
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,220
And this is necessary
but is not sufficient.

233
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,800
Then we look at creating
multiple layers of defense,

234
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,840
robustness, and these
layers of defense

235
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,080
can include pilot training
and procedures and maintenance

236
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,860
and making certain that the
pilot doesn't have the fan disk

237
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,480
blow apart in the first place--

238
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,910
necessary, but again,
not sufficient.

239
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,280
And finally, we
find that we have

240
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,090
to also look at how we
control the situation.

241
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,780
And the levels of control again
are operational control, traffic

242
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,540
flow management, so you don't
have a pile up of airplanes

243
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,475
in the same sector.

244
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:39,150

245
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,150
Specifically
important is how do we

246
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,260
control the situation right
at the point of the incident,

247
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,420
of the problem--

248
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,340
the pointy end of the stick.

249
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,980
Now there's multiple
layers of control.

250
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,930
But hey, it's always fun to talk
about autonomy and autoflight

251
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,380
and to talk about how control
automation shaped the flight

252
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,020
deck.

253
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,230
So here is a picture
of an aircraft design

254
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,010
and first flown in 1969.

255
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,950
You can see that there's four
throttles, four stacks of engine

256
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,520
instruments, and there's even
a flight engineer over here,

257
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,410
a third pilot in the cockpit.

258
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,100
So I hope you can guess if
you're in this auditorium what

259
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,370
airplane this was.

260
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,670
And here was the redo, the
model 400 from the 1990s.

261
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,440
It still has the same
flight instruments,

262
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,600
but now they're shown
on a glass cockpit.

263
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,410
It still has the four engines,
but all the engine instruments

264
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,690
are shown again on
the glass screen.

265
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,010
And instead of having a flight
engineer, a third pilot,

266
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,440
we have reduced the pilots from
three being standard to two.

267
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,990
What the flight engineer used
to do is now start and stop.

268
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,330
The full authority
digital engine controller

269
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,860
is a full authority controller.

270
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:06,200
There are things that we
have successfully automated,

271
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,320
but there are other
things like where

272
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,200
do we want the airplane
to go that are very hard.

273
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,130
And for this, I will return
back to the Cali accident.

274
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,910
And with the Cali
accident, this is a picture

275
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,160
in the lower right here is
from the control display

276
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,350
unit recreated by the
NTSB from the NTSB report.

277
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,210

278
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,760
Why did the airplane try
to fly through a mountain?

279
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,160
Well, the airplane logic was
suggesting go to waypoint R

280
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,130
and then join the route
into land at Cali.

281
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,280
And the pilots had very
poor understanding.

282
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,910
What does this mean?

283
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,670
Should I have even gone to
point R in the first place?

284
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,460
And the answer is no.

285
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,190
And so here now,
we're also starting

286
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,400
to think not just about
the single technology,

287
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,660
but how do we get the
parts to work together?

288
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,980
How do we get--

289
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,000
particularly close
to my own heart--

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,870
how do we get the pilot
and the technology

291
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,250
actually working
together better?

292
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:21,580
And again, we can point to some
things in this time in the 1990s

293
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:28,800
where Eric Johnson and I met
each other by doing a class

294
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,380
project for Tom Sheridan
and John Hansman,

295
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,080
where we proved that in
the building 37 simulator,

296
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,710
it was pretty easy for me to put
the captains in what would be

297
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,370
an innocent mistake into a steep
descent into terrain and most

298
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,850
of them to not detect it until
it was too late to pull up.

299
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,130
And on the right, I'll show
the vertical profile display,

300
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,620
recognizing Sanjay Vakil,
Alan Midkiff, and John Hansman

301
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,160
here that emphasizes
not just where are you

302
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,630
in space and time in
a vertical profile,

303
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,720
but where is the autoflight
system going to take you

304
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,350
with the way it's programmed
right now, a display that I

305
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,120
think we can now
pretty much point to

306
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,470
in the A380 787 and other
subsequent aircraft?

307
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:21,410
So with this, we're working on
many new questions about how

308
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,100
human-machine interact.

309
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,190
We haven't answered them yet.

310
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,790
Aviation, I think of as
the leader in aviation

311
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,350
in human factors, and for this,
I point out that in 1951, it

312
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,890
was in a National Academy
study chaired by Paul Fitts

313
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,920
looking at effective
air navigation that

314
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,400
posted this model, a model
I wish that could be burned

315
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,680
at the stake and
tortured for its value

316
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,100
that it doesn't have called
"the men are better at.

317
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,490
Machines are better at."

318
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,850
And I mind not just
the gender language,

319
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,110
but the fact that it doesn't
understand that the two of them

320
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,560
need to interact and it
doesn't understand something

321
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,030
fundamental about who ultimately
controls the situation.

322
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,819
For that, I think we should go
back to the Federal Aviation

323
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,910
regulations.

324
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,859
Who controls the situation?

325
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,710
The pilot in command
of an aircraft

326
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:16,589
is directly
responsible for and is

327
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,609
the final authority as to the
operation of that aircraft.

328
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,230
And what does that mean?

329
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,589
It means that as
the captain, you

330
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:28,860
engage the autoflight system.

331
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,650
What do you do?

332
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,660
There's a 1996
Simpsons episode that

333
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,310
says once you engage
this navitron system,

334
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,680
all you have to do is sit
back and feel your ass grow.

335
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,010
We're not recording this.

336
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,670
I'm just quoting The Simpsons.

337
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,400
But no, as the pilot--

338
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,200
the pilot in command--

339
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,900
you now have to sit
there and monitor it.

340
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,980
How often do you
need to monitor it?

341
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,490
As fast as it can screw up.

342
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,440
For an autopilot,
that's pretty fast.

343
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,440
And then you need
to figure out when

344
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,580
to intervene and to intervene
before it is critical.

345
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,330
And this is not easy.

346
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,000
Now that I'm a
department head, I

347
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,720
can assure you monitoring and
supervising and intervening

348
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,390
is harder than just
doing the task yourself.

349
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,370
And yet this is the task that
we are putting pilots into.

350
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,340
Let's put them
into a tough spot.

351
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,220
We say that their role
is shifted to monitoring.

352
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,890

353
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,170
And yet there were
brilliant things said before

354
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,400
in that 1951 report.

355
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,240
The mamba mamba list was
embraced by the controls

356
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,680
and autonomy engineers.

357
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,850
Yeah, I can get my machines to
do these-- these new things.

358
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,180
And it's commonly cited.

359
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,560
Rarely cited is what's
on the next page.

360
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,500
In 1951, they took the
position that human operators

361
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,230
are poor monitors when
all they have to do

362
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,290
is watch the performance
of automatic equipment.

363
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,470
And so with this, we are at
a very interesting time where

364
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,620
we are seeing public-private
partnerships in aviation safety,

365
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,580
broad discussions throughout
the industry, talking about,

366
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,260
wow, what do we need
to do differently?

367
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,870
Not just focusing on one
system or one technology,

368
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,430
but looking at broad
operational principles.

369
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,540
And so now moving
forward to 2013,

370
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,050
the safety alert for
operators was actually

371
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,360
recommending that we have
pilots fly more often,

372
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,150
maintain not just the
manual control skills,

373
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,530
but we're now finding that you
need those same manual control

374
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:42,370
skills also to have the mental
skills, the knowledge, the task

375
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:45,520
ability to monitor
in the first place

376
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,970
and detect when something
is not going right.

377
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,730

378
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,310
Finally, bringing this
up to the very latest

379
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,320
stage, pointing out
some things again,

380
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,140
from the National Academies
that we're working on.

381
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,340
We find that the same
names keep popping up

382
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,500
in these national
level committees that

383
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,170
are coming together to look at
the current state of aviation

384
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,580
safety.

385
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,290
In our overall review of the
aviation industry's ability

386
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:17,860
to identify safety
issues, our summary

387
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,570
is that there are many ways that
we are monitoring air transport

388
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,350
safety right now as based on
the tube and wing aircraft that

389
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,780
are flying the
operational models that we

390
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,520
have at this point.

391
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,220
They span from
single organizations

392
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,540
to industry-wide teams, like the
commercial aviation safety team.

393
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,430
They span deep dives
on particular hazards

394
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,050
to things they're
monitoring systemwide.

395
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,960
And in this, we now have
the mechanisms in place

396
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,440
to be jumping on
any immediate issue.

397
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,900
And extrapolating
forward, what do we think

398
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,170
are the intermediate potential
near-term evolution issues?

399
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,510
But the predictive
is kind of hidden

400
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,870
a little on the Rubik's cube.

401
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,690
It's a little hidden
off on the right.

402
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,810
Predictive-- how do we predict
the safety of something

403
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,080
that's never flown?

404
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,680
Some new AAM vehicle
that's brought in

405
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,370
or V/STOL aircraft flying with
a very different business model,

406
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,450
very different traffic density,
and traffic operations.

407
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:27,120
For this, we need new
methods and new time frames.

408
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,140
And this is in the face of
all the amazing things that

409
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,350
are happening in
aviation right now.

410
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,370
Each of these things,
we can look at going,

411
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,350
wow, we can do new
business models.

412
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,680
We can have
transportation that gets

413
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,230
above the gridlock
of Mass Ave. We

414
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:48,720
can have new technologies that
are so much more efficient.

415
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,300
We can help with
sustainability and climate,

416
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,690
but at the same point
we also then say,

417
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,370
and how do we predict the safety
impact to maintain the safety

418
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:02,010
level for things
that we don't have

419
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,960
that same weight
of knowledge for?

420
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,207
An interesting time,
if I had an answer,

421
00:22:08,207 --> 00:22:09,790
this would have been
a different talk.

422
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,970
But as it is, I'm
just saying this

423
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,670
is where we are now with big
questions left to be answered.

424
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,530
And so I thank you,
and I offer apologies

425
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,660
to similar important
technical advances

426
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,700
in addressing aviation
safety, including

427
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,250
icing, wind shear, collision
avoidance, and detection

428
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,660
and so forth.

429
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,917
Thank you.

430
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:32,402
[APPLAUSE]

431
00:22:32,402 --> 00:22:46,330

432
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:46,830
All right.

433
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,280
Hello, that was a great setup.

434
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,210
OK, I'm Craig Wenke, and I'm
going to talk about air traffic

435
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,110
systems.

436
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,970
There's a little
bit of obviously

437
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,660
the relationship
to safety is there.

438
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,158
I'm going to say a
little bit about myself

439
00:23:01,158 --> 00:23:02,700
and that it's relevant
to this, which

440
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,560
is I was here at MIT for
10 years roughly, mostly

441
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,720
working with John
during that time.

442
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,480
I took that
experience to my work

443
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,855
at Miter, where
we operate what's

444
00:23:13,855 --> 00:23:15,938
called a federally funded
research and Development

445
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,640
Center for the FAA,
which is where I've

446
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,790
spent all of the last 31 years.

447
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:24,323
And along that time, I spent a
lot of time working with AIAA as

448
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:25,740
well, as I'm sure
you do, and I'll

449
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,520
get to why that's
important later on.

450
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,140
I wanted to go back to when
I was preparing this talk.

451
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,510
I wanted to go back to
see some of the things

452
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,070
that we did in
graduate school, and I

453
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,760
had to go find a paper that
had a figure that would reflect

454
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,660
what we worked on.

455
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,770
That figure was glued together
with glue sticks and pasted up

456
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,670
to be photographed for a paper.

457
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:49,330
But one of the
accidents that Amie

458
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,880
didn't talk about that
were kind of in the news

459
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,710
when we were in
grad school, were

460
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:54,950
wind shear related accidents.

461
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,410
And there had been a couple
of them, notable one,

462
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,040
the Eastern accident,
where the airplane was

463
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,040
lost because it flew through a
downburst from a thunderstorm.

464
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,080
And so systems were being
developed to alleviate this.

465
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,890
And you see the terminal doppler
weather radar on the lower left

466
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,900
and other systems
like the low level

467
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,420
wind shear avoidance
system on the right.

468
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,910
And the question
was, how would we

469
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,660
use these systems to
stop these accidents?

470
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,827
You'll notice no accidents
have happened since then.

471
00:24:19,827 --> 00:24:21,680
I can't tie it
directly to this work,

472
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,860
although the TDWR has
something to do with it.

473
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,710
But in the process of what
my work was around, how would

474
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:31,460
you design a system to detect,
synthesize data, and alert

475
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,750
the pilot of these things?

476
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,870
And in so doing, it
formed everything

477
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:38,270
I needed to go forth
in a career and looking

478
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,960
at human decision support
in the context of aviation.

479
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,340
And that's going to be
the theme of this talk.

480
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,633
So human-centered design
is one of those things.

481
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:48,050
Something else I
wanted to mention

482
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,980
for those of you who are in
this stage of your career.

483
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,480
The other thing that John taught
me that was super important

484
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,590
was that publishing is a
way to actually execute

485
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,200
on your entire plan because
you submit abstracts

486
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,940
for things you haven't done yet,
and then you have a deadline.

487
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,440
And you're not being
fearless enough

488
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,770
if you never withdraw a paper.

489
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:10,970
So it's OK to occasionally
withdraw a paper.

490
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,460
And finally, aviation is
all about weather, also

491
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,260
terrain, but also but
also all about weather.

492
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,370
And as I went on to
my career in working

493
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,720
in the national-- on the
National Airspace System,

494
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,070
I really began to appreciate all
the ways in which that is true.

495
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,180
Now, one of the things that
I found as soon as I left MIT

496
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,700
was that I was now
at a company that

497
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,280
was supporting the entire
development of the National

498
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,000
Airspace System.

499
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,500
And I lamented the
fact that the one

500
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,270
course I never took in aviation
at MIT was air traffic control.

501
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,220
So I had to learn all of that.

502
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,380
This is a diagram
of all the systems

503
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,410
that make up the US Air
Traffic Control system.

504
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,350
And it's an imposing system.

505
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,100
So you can see
the numbers there.

506
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,740
I'm not going to
go through them.

507
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,660
And it's run by a team of
14,000 air traffic controllers

508
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,160
and a number of other folks
that handle the other functions,

509
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,535
the traffic
management functions,

510
00:26:01,535 --> 00:26:03,350
and so on and so forth.

511
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:08,020
And so anything that
is introduced to this

512
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,230
really needs to be
carefully considered.

513
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,920
Safety is the
number one priority.

514
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,345
And as Amy noted, the current
safety record is excellent.

515
00:26:16,345 --> 00:26:18,220
And so everything that
needs to be introduced

516
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,910
has to be compared to that
record, which I'm sure Brian

517
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,510
will probably get into later.

518
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:30,130
So over the 31 years since
I graduated, a lot of things

519
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,790
have happened in this system.

520
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,790
There's something called
the Next Generation Air

521
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,540
Transportation
System was deployed.

522
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,137
And this revamped all of the
primary automation systems.

523
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:39,970
There's a lot of jokes
back in the day about

524
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,830
how the FAA ran systems
on vacuum tubes.

525
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,920
To my knowledge, there
are no more of those.

526
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,340
I'm not entirely sure.

527
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,340
There may be in Alaska
some weather systems that

528
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,480
have vacuum tubes in them,
but for the most part,

529
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,270
the system has been deployed.

530
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,180
And we move a lot more
people and freight today

531
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,750
than we did back
when I graduated.

532
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,550
And the delays are
generally not worse,

533
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,130
which tells you what's working.

534
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,500
So that's the state of the art
over the course of that time.

535
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,480
And where much of my work was is
that the science of air traffic

536
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,680
flow management has
changed radically.

537
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,595
Back in the day, 31 years ago,
the FAA controlled everything.

538
00:27:14,595 --> 00:27:16,720
Now there's a collaborative
decision-making process

539
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,140
where the airlines and the
DOD and other operators

540
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,130
take part in the
management of the system.

541
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,310
And that's been a major advance.

542
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,040
Weather forecasts have improved.

543
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,190
Traffic management
tools have improved.

544
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,667
And so our ability
to do more than just

545
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,250
keep aircraft from
hitting each other,

546
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,333
but rather to make the
whole system more efficient

547
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:35,130
has improved.

548
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,710
And we've gone to
something called

549
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,280
trajectory-based operations.

550
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,770
And what this means
in practicality

551
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,110
is that when things get
incredibly dense at an airport,

552
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:46,380
we can manage the flow
by time of arrival.

553
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,600
And because of the deployment
of GPS and other precision

554
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,610
navigation systems,
aircraft are much better

555
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,440
at following those
things, provided

556
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,460
that the pilots are
interacting with the system

557
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,780
and not just watching it happen
and it was just talking about.

558
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,400
So just briefly, you guys
probably already know this,

559
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,150
but I didn't know it
when I left MIT, so I

560
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,520
figured I would put it in here.

561
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,937
Air traffic control
is what people

562
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:14,130
know is controllers
separating airplanes.

563
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,420
It's a fairly exact science.

564
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,470
It's well defined.

565
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,530
There are tools that have been
deployed over the past 31 years.

566
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,800
But fundamentally, it's not that
different than it was back then.

567
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,240
A traffic management
where you're

568
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,410
looking out, say, 30
minutes to 24 hours

569
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,410
to plan against things that
are probably going to happen

570
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,540
is something that has been
evolving quite radically

571
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,430
over that time.

572
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,860
And it involves many,
many stakeholders.

573
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,180
It's a bit of an art.

574
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,018
And honestly, there are a lot of
still unsolved problems in this.

575
00:28:44,018 --> 00:28:46,060
And so that's where I'm
going to spend a good bit

576
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,325
of the time in this lecture.

577
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:50,670

578
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,940
So to get back to weather,
aviation weather forecasting

579
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,610
is challenging.

580
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:57,550
It's one thing to know if
you're going to hold a picnic,

581
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,300
that it's the 30% chance
of rain this afternoon.

582
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,480
You need much, much
more precise weather

583
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,978
to do anything with aviation.

584
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:07,020
You need to know whether
a particular routes will

585
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,330
be closed, whether
airports will be closed

586
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,830
or will be impacted
by low visibility.

587
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,620
This is an example
of the absolute state

588
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,070
of the art in long range
thunderstorm forecasting.

589
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,120
Each of those areas, which
are hundreds of miles long,

590
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,120
tell you that there's
maybe a certain likelihood

591
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,790
of thunderstorms happening and
what the likely tops of those

592
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,380
would be.

593
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,480
Planning to this is not
trivial, nor is it precise.

594
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,660
And so the essence of the
modern system is flexibility.

595
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,853
You have a lot of
tools to manage flows.

596
00:29:37,853 --> 00:29:39,270
And so the challenge
is how do you

597
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,370
react to something like this?

598
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,875
Under 90 minutes, we can
watch thunderstorms move,

599
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,250
and we have a
pretty good chance.

600
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,550
So I'm going to talk about are
some of the tools that I've

601
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:50,008
been involved with developing
and applied my lessons that I

602
00:29:50,008 --> 00:29:54,120
learned here at MIT to
help develop and deploy

603
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,130
and some things that
we haven't solved yet.

604
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,900
So one of the first
things I got involved

605
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,100
with when I left here
was in trying to support

606
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,850
this collaborative
decision-making process

607
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,520
by giving traffic managers
what you would think

608
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,730
would be a very simple thing.

609
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,710
There's weather.

610
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,918
We have a pretty good idea
of where it's going to be.

611
00:30:10,918 --> 00:30:13,293
How do we know which airplanes
are going to encounter it,

612
00:30:13,293 --> 00:30:14,480
and what do we do about it?

613
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,310
So again, simple problem.

614
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,463
They had no way to do this.

615
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:19,130
You were doing this
incredibly manually.

616
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,290
And so all of this--

617
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:23,290
all of this did.

618
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,900
We actually pulled a trailer
out at one of the centers

619
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,500
and put a bunch of
computers in it.

620
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,750
And we let traffic managers
come out and play with it,

621
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,650
looking at the real data and
do some tests to get back

622
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:36,040
to human-centered design
and come up with a system

623
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,748
where you could draw
a polygon or a line,

624
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:39,540
and you could add a
bunch of filters to it.

625
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,313
And it could move.

626
00:30:40,313 --> 00:30:41,980
And what it would
fundamentally give you

627
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,060
in the middle of
the screen, there

628
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,770
is a list of which
flights were involved

629
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:49,100
and how many were encountering
it as a function of time.

630
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,620
And what we found was if you
give them something like this

631
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,700
and it was deployed in what was
then called the enhanced traffic

632
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,750
management system, they would
find a million ways to use it.

633
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,330
And so this tool actually is
the basis of a lot of the things

634
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:05,030
that caused your pilot to
say while you're sitting

635
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,960
on the runway in and
perfectly clear weather,

636
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,180
we can't leave because
of air traffic control.

637
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,410
That's actually a good
thing, believe it or not.

638
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:16,070
But there are things called
airspace flow programs that

639
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,460
keep us from overloading sector
controllers near these weather

640
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,510
areas and a whole host of other
what we call traffic management

641
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:27,902
initiatives that are planned
by the use of these things.

642
00:31:27,902 --> 00:31:29,610
And one of the things
I learned from this

643
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:32,018
was that if you give
people a flexible tool,

644
00:31:32,018 --> 00:31:33,810
they will find all
kinds of innovative ways

645
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,180
to use it that you probably
didn't even [INAUDIBLE].

646
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,210
But the most important thing
about giving any kind of tool

647
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,820
to people who have essentially
a full slate of work

648
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,587
on their plate, that the first
thing it has to do is save time.

649
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:47,170
And that's what
computers are good at.

650
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,860
Have the computer do the
things that are drudgery,

651
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,890
the things that are
difficult, and then

652
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,120
but have it be an interactive
part of the process.

653
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,920
And this was a great
example of that.

654
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,050
The next thing we tried
to do was say, OK,

655
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,710
let's say you take some action.

656
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,420
To move aircraft
around that weather.

657
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,310
What's the impact
of that going to be?

658
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,320
This proved to be
a much harder thing

659
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,145
to get designed appropriately
and for them to do so.

660
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:13,520
On the left there,
you see a case

661
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,290
where something called
a national playbook

662
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,830
play is being evaluated.

663
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,740
That's a predefined
set of routes

664
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,470
that get around weather
in certain places.

665
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,470
And there is a whole virtual
online book of those.

666
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,970
You can actually
look it up yourself

667
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:30,640
if you go to the NOAA
status page on the web.

668
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,790
But in this case, it's
going to move possibly

669
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,790
hundreds of airplanes.

670
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,998
And the question is, what
will that do to the system?

671
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:40,060
And so on the right
is a system that

672
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,218
was deployed that
allows you to test that,

673
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:44,260
and it tells you how many
airplanes you're moving

674
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,360
from one place to another.

675
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,500
Without getting
into detail, this

676
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,060
is a tool for
determining whether you

677
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,430
have the right staffing
in place to handle this.

678
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,970
From the time that this
was developed to the time

679
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,960
that it was deployed
was 17 years,

680
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,880
which is on the long side.

681
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,910
Typical I think the average
time to deploy a new feature

682
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,580
to the NAS is about 10.

683
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,080
But this is what
happens when you're

684
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,247
working with a system that
has to work all the time.

685
00:33:12,247 --> 00:33:15,510
And it's an argument I get into
with my military colleagues

686
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,060
all the time on the
other side of miter where

687
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,110
they can deploy something
in two or three years.

688
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,580
And the difference is ours
have to work all the time.

689
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,220
A military system can
work 95% of the time

690
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,840
and still be acceptable and
still give you an advantage.

691
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,757
And that's a huge
difference when you're

692
00:33:31,757 --> 00:33:32,840
working in an air traffic.

693
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,060

694
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,640
The next step beyond this was
to start thinking about systems

695
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,920
that suggest solutions.

696
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,350
And this is an example
of one that we worked on,

697
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,800
and it employed some
NASA ideas as well.

698
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,780
But basically, the
idea would be instead

699
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,250
of having to
develop those routes

700
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,130
and do what-if examples to test
them and so forth, you could

701
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,620
actually identify for each
aircraft involved, what would be

702
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,080
a reasonably optimal route to
get around a weather situation,

703
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,750
coordinate it.

704
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,270
And then one of the big
problems with rerouting

705
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:06,370
is you have to collaborate
amongst facilities.

706
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,310
And so this would automate
that coordination.

707
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,610
Again, we did a bunch of
human in the loop testing

708
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:15,556
and worked through it until
they were satisfied with it

709
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:16,639
and thought it would work.

710
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,130
It was put into the
deployment pipeline,

711
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,489
and then the funding dried up.

712
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:23,420
But it is a possible
thing to do.

713
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,070
It's still potentially
on the list,

714
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,800
so maybe someday we'll
see something like this.

715
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,710
But to date, we don't move
aircraft one at a time.

716
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,679
We move them in giant groups.

717
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,120
So that's still the
state of the art.

718
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,070
And the last system I
wanted to talk about

719
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,600
was the problem
of strategic TFM.

720
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,350
The stuff that I was
talking about before,

721
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,517
you saw pictures of weather.

722
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:46,864
That means we had either
weather radar returns on there

723
00:34:46,864 --> 00:34:49,239
or we had short-term predictions
where you could actually

724
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,949
draw essentially
where you thought

725
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,239
the weather was going to move.

726
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,833
But strategic TFM uses
that initial weather

727
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:56,500
picture that I saw,
which is that I have

728
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,250
a vague idea of where
the problem is going

729
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,492
to be 12 hours from now, six
hours from now, whatever it is.

730
00:35:01,492 --> 00:35:02,950
And I have a bunch
of aircraft that

731
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,630
are going to take off and maybe
spend five hours in the air.

732
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,460
What do I want to do?

733
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,380
And there's a couple of
problems with this situation.

734
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,980
Number one, typically, when
humans are solving a problem,

735
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,590
they rely on past experience.

736
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:20,950
You never get the same weather
day twice in the past, really.

737
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,330
And so it's very hard to learn.

738
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,730
The other is you have a bunch
of stakeholders involved

739
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,070
that have different objectives.

740
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,220
The FAA folks want to
protect their controllers

741
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,720
so that they continue to
safely handle the aircraft.

742
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,650
Airlines obviously want
to meet their schedule.

743
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:42,640
DOD wants to execute their
mission, so on and so forth.

744
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,450
And so it's not clear
what winning looks either.

745
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,880
So it makes it a hard
problem to solve.

746
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,430
So the way we do this today
is that every two hours, there

747
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,680
is a teleconference
where we argue about what

748
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,890
the right solution ought to be
and pick some set of solutions

749
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,900
out of an infinite design space
and then see how they work.

750
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,480
And then two hours
later, we go back

751
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,510
and have another argument
and work on the next thing.

752
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,310
And so for years
and years, we've

753
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,482
been trying to design systems
that would solve this problem.

754
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:12,940
You're looking at a picture
here of the Air Traffic Control

755
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,370
Command Center in Northern
Virginia, where this--

756
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,180
which is where they
coordinate this argument.

757
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,590
And the data that they
have is the weather

758
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,000
forecast that you saw and
some other weather forecasts.

759
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,670
They have counts of
traffic around the area.

760
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,900
And of course, they still use
those flow evaluation areas

761
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,020
that I showed back then to
look at what traffic is where.

762
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,930
But there aren't really any
diagnostic systems to do that.

763
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:42,470
So you can't have a talk
today about aviation

764
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,430
without AI coming
into it someplace.

765
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:47,570
So this is where
we're trying to apply

766
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,675
modern artificial intelligence
to solve that specific problem.

767
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:53,240

768
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,730
Past attempts to solve
this problem using

769
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,160
previous kinds of
technologies have generally

770
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,250
failed due to the same reason
that it's hard for humans

771
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,040
to solve this problem, which
is that it's very hard to draw

772
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,770
conclusions about what
worked in the past

773
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:10,550
because you don't really
have great data to work from.

774
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,818
Modern machine learning
systems, turns out,

775
00:37:12,818 --> 00:37:14,360
can piece things
together pretty well

776
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,960
from a whole variety of
vaguely similar situations

777
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,320
and draw better conclusions.

778
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,410
And so for the
first time, we think

779
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,900
we've found something that
can help people navigate

780
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,880
this enormous design space.

781
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:34,170
And you just look at-- to give
an example of what these kinds

782
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,045
of problems are--

783
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:42,220

784
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:47,450
so I'm just going to
go to this, actually.

785
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,160
Look at a real example.

786
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,220
Here's a very simple air
traffic management example.

787
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,190
Something's happening, in this
case, in the Atlanta area.

788
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,787
And you might have low
ceilings at the airport.

789
00:37:57,787 --> 00:37:59,120
They'll reduce the arrival rate.

790
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,480
You might have weather that's
occluding the fixes that

791
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,260
supply that traffic to it.

792
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,140
And if you go through
and say, well, I

793
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,980
could control with a ground
delay program, the arrival rate.

794
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,750
Over the next, say,
four to six hours,

795
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,900
I have a variety start and
end times hourly rates.

796
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,320
I can decide which
aircraft are in there.

797
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,140
I can put in trail
spacing restrictions on

798
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,800
or the time-based
metering on those fixes.

799
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,260
I can decide to
ground stop traffic

800
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,270
into Atlanta for a while.

801
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,060
If I just go through and
enumerate those possible design

802
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,850
choices, you rapidly
get into the billions,

803
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,320
trillions of options.

804
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,930
And they do this
today, and they just

805
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,760
make those decisions
based on their sort

806
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,970
of intuition and experience.

807
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,830
And then you take
that against the fact

808
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:48,060
that you have variation
in the weather.

809
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:51,200
And so we actually have
forecasts now that our ensemble

810
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,230
forecasts that they generate a
whole series of possible weather

811
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,170
outcomes.

812
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:59,060
The one we use for this
happens to generate 26.

813
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,850
And so the question is,
over all that possible range

814
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:05,300
of outcomes, what are the
best designs for solving

815
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,830
that problem?

816
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,710
And all the things
we've tried in the past,

817
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,470
we've actually been able
to solve it and come up

818
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,680
with reasonable solutions.

819
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,510
But the compute
times range in weeks,

820
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,760
which obviously [INAUDIBLE].

821
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,130
But AI, with using AI methods,
actually using a method that's--

822
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,250
that was tested
to play StarCraft,

823
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,960
we adapted it to
this, and it actually

824
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,040
it does find a reasonable
solution for that.

825
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,470
So there is some promise
that we can finally

826
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:40,320
bring some science to the
traffic management process.

827
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,630
And it's time because
the system is now

828
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,670
entering a period of
change that we haven't

829
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,270
seen over those 31 years.

830
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:53,350
Amy mentioned new aircraft,
standard commercial aircraft.

831
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:56,070
That's been the bulk of
the concern of the FAA

832
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:59,140
and the aviation community
for all of that time.

833
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,020
And that's really
beginning to change.

834
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:07,020
We have small UAS at the
low end of the spectrum,

835
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,840
small unmanned aircraft, Amazon
package delivery type things

836
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,270
and, so on and so forth.

837
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:18,720
That's a new operational design,
urban air mobility or aircraft,

838
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,420
such as Brian's
potentially going to talk

839
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,710
about, eVTOLs and air
taxi type things which

840
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,820
are potentially
revolutionary for short range

841
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,930
and for regional mobility.

842
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,570
The tempo of space launches,
you've probably noticed,

843
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,490
has gone--

844
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:37,580
it's gone up radically.

845
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,970
We're now launching
almost every day,

846
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,640
and every SpaceX launch is
a challenge to the airspace.

847
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,400
It blocks a bunch of
airspace and so on.

848
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,510
And so and at high
altitude, we're

849
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,270
potentially going to start
having supersonic aircraft that

850
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,610
behave quite differently
from traditional aircraft.

851
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:57,130
And so in the face
of this, if we're

852
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,040
going to maintain and
achieve the economic benefits

853
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,810
of these new types
of aviation, we

854
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:04,640
have to really improve the
way that we handle traffic.

855
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,810
And not only that, the
traditional FAA model

856
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,230
where we talk to all the
airplanes is no longer viable.

857
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,860
And so some of
these operations are

858
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:18,760
going to have to be handled by
private service providers that

859
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,940
will have to deconflict, for
example, these small package

860
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,060
delivery aircraft.

861
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,540
And the FAA is going to have
to be comfortable enough

862
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,400
with those operations to certify
them and say that that's OK,

863
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,040
that's safe enough.

864
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,960
So if you're looking for
problems to solve, on this slide

865
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,720
are lots and lots of
problems to solve--

866
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,370
a lot of great thesis topics.

867
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,960
And I'm sure John can tell you
which ones are most important--

868
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,340
so not the supersonic.

869
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,890

870
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,390
No, that's good.

871
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,540
So just back to
what I learned as I

872
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,360
tried to apply those lessons.

873
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,250
Human-centered design is hard.

874
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:59,930
Over the course of trying
to get things deployed

875
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,200
and understanding how they would
work in the National Airspace

876
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,790
System, we've gone through a
whole bunch of experiments,

877
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,360
some of which were inspired by
those original experiments we

878
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,170
did on that iRIS 2400, which I
found a video about it where it

879
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,710
said it could render dozens
of polygons several times

880
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,540
per second, which I
thought was excellent.

881
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:21,320
We have better
tools for that now.

882
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,690
But it's still a challenge.

883
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,270
A lot of times, you're
introducing a decision support

884
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:31,490
system because you want
people to essentially do

885
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,510
their job differently.

886
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,010
And they're only
going to look at it

887
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:38,550
and say, how can I do my current
job quickly, more easily,

888
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,570
so on and so forth?

889
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,510
That's a challenging problem.

890
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:43,490
Traffic management is
governed by uncertainty

891
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:46,030
in weather and demand
and so on and so forth.

892
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,570
And the science of
human machine teaming--

893
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,777
again, perfect segue has
come a long way since 1951,

894
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,610
but we still don't
understand it completely.

895
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:56,700
How do we work with
AI-supported systems in a way

896
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,680
where the human is
still maintaining

897
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,693
sort of central
command of the task

898
00:43:00,693 --> 00:43:02,110
and the understanding
of the task,

899
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:05,340
but is doing it much
more efficiently?

900
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,770
And interestingly, it's
still all about weather,

901
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,680
and the weather is
getting noticeably worse.

902
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,920
The severity of
thunderstorms is increasing.

903
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,650
Incidents of turbulence is
increasing significantly.

904
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:21,900
Obviously, the world
is getting hotter.

905
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,470
Over those 31 years,
there have been

906
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,012
a couple of examples
of aircraft that

907
00:43:25,012 --> 00:43:28,020
had to be recertified to take
off at higher temperatures

908
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,030
because we now
have higher takeoff

909
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,110
temperatures at some airports.

910
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,670
And that's not going to stop
changing unless we radically

911
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:41,250
improve our consciousness.

912
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:45,232
And I'm still having
adventures in publishing.

913
00:43:45,232 --> 00:43:46,940
We still do the thing
with the abstracts,

914
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,610
but I now am an editor
in chief of a journal,

915
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:52,057
so I get to really
appreciate some of the things

916
00:43:52,057 --> 00:43:53,390
that people are doing out there.

917
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:56,320
And those adventures
now have gone

918
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,970
to getting texts
that are written

919
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,430
by AI, which isn't as
useful in application,

920
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:05,300
I think, as some of the
ones we were just talking.

921
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,760
But in any case,
that's what I have.

922
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,446
Thank you.

923
00:44:11,446 --> 00:44:15,390
[APPLAUSE]

924
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:23,790

925
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,980
You're not going to walk
around because this.

926
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,260
How do you know that?

927
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:33,240
Hi, so my dad was a
priest, my late father.

928
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,480
And so he always said a sermon,
you have to have three things.

929
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,600
So I'm going to do three things
with three different stories.

930
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,640
So the fun thing I want to
talk about problems where

931
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,600
you can trace the impact--

932
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,920
have big impact on the world
in the environmental space.

933
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,790
Second thing I'm going to do
is going to show the lineage

934
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:58,860
or how it dated back
to work with John.

935
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,600
And the third, because
it's my nature,

936
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:05,500
I have to rip job John just a
little bit as it wouldn't be me

937
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,040
otherwise.

938
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,200
So I start with
this, which doesn't

939
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,500
seem like aerospace engineering,
where it takes a pebble

940
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,470
to make a pearl.

941
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:17,480
And the thing about the
pebble is a foreign body.

942
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,400
Well, for most of us,
that's our John Hansman.

943
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,880

944
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,510
I was just on my line.

945
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:31,120
I'm not saying he
is an irritant.

946
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:36,670
However, I do say that his
demand for critical thinking

947
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:42,600
has been the pebble that
has made many a pearl.

948
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,340
And forgive me for focusing
on only two of these pearls

949
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,920
or three of these pearls.

950
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,840
But those are closest
to me, so I can speak

951
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,260
most authoritively about them.

952
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,620
So the first pearl
is the work that's

953
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,530
been done on environmental
considerations in the approach

954
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,780
and landing.

955
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:04,820
And I still remember the day
when I got back from JPL,

956
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:08,000
and John said, what do
you want to do for your--

957
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,480
after I finish my
master's thesis,

958
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,820
which was on quantum receivers,
definitely not aerospace.

959
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,420
And John said, what
do you want to do?

960
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,520
And we started talking about
new R&R procedures and GPS

961
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,940
and what you could do with that.

962
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:24,890
And we started coming up with
a concept of using GPS and R&R

963
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:27,200
procedures to change the
way we operate airplanes

964
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,720
to reduce noise.

965
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,840
So this was some earlier work
done in the late '60s, early

966
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,650
'70s, but they didn't have the
kind of capabilities that we had

967
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,980
at the time, which
compared to these days,

968
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:40,060
even baby compared to
what we have these days.

969
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,810
But at that time, it
was state of the art.

970
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:45,190
And so the one thing that, in
addition to critical thinking,

971
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:47,120
was a holistic view
of the problem.

972
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,650
It wasn't just putting something
in a numerical simulation

973
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:51,395
and running it.

974
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:53,770
It was actually bringing the
human-centered design, which

975
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:56,120
both Amy and Craig spoke about.

976
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,580
And so we created
this tool called

977
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:02,510
Noisome, which was basically a
lot of algorithms in one side.

978
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,780
And then our partner simulator,
which you've heard about before,

979
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,820
and we had to--

980
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,040
I think we've reprogrammed
the autopilot.

981
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,150
And I think multiple times
for different projects,

982
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,420
but we were able to
do human in the loop

983
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,470
studies looking at
flight procedures.

984
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:18,010
And so instead of
having what you

985
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,952
have on the bottom right, which
is the standard air traffic

986
00:47:20,952 --> 00:47:23,410
control procedure where you
level off and come in based leg

987
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:25,730
and turn on final
intercept from below,

988
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,490
we were able to
start the descent

989
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:30,270
from much higher altitude,
keeping that throttles.

990
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:31,730
And on the top
right, you can see

991
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,620
what resulted from our studies.

992
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,370
This is the arrival
into New York.

993
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:39,507
The left image is the one
for the current procedure.

994
00:47:39,507 --> 00:47:41,590
The one on the right is
the one for the procedures

995
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:43,880
that we end up
designing for New York.

996
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:46,190
As you can see, the
contours are way smaller.

997
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,430
That said, we still
had that somebody,

998
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,060
that cavemen chiseling away.

999
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,540
Complaining about the noise.

1000
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,620
So noise stayed with us forever.

1001
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,270
And I'll get back to that when
I get to the third problem.

1002
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:03,710
So after that work
with John and I did,

1003
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,350
I end up-- when I joined the
faculty here, had a student

1004
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,780
leading Wren, and
we took that work.

1005
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,940
And then we did some
flight tests at Louisville

1006
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:17,480
in 2000, 2002, and we developed
a very rigorous simulation

1007
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,270
that we could actually model the
wind fields and all the aircraft

1008
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:22,400
dynamics, and we're
able to actually predict

1009
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,430
how far apart you needed those
airplanes so that they could

1010
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:29,630
be at idle from the top of this
end, the center of the runway,

1011
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,770
and not run into each other.

1012
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,520
And we did this flight
test at Louisville.

1013
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,810
And I got to tell you
that there is something

1014
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:41,310
about doing numbers and trusting
them because the first night,

1015
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,510
I wasn't there.

1016
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:47,120
And we told them we need these
airplanes 15 miles apart.

1017
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,300
And they called me before.

1018
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,350
You're sure 15 miles?

1019
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,410
It's like Leling says so.

1020
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,330
I've looked over
the calculations.

1021
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,810
We're going with 15 miles.

1022
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:55,370
Trust me.

1023
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:56,370
My fingers were crossed.

1024
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:57,540
My toes were crossed.

1025
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,190
Everything was crossed.

1026
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,420
But it worked out.

1027
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,750
And that experiment
basically showed--

1028
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,150
and we had a bunch
of noise monitors

1029
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,830
around how we
could significantly

1030
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,780
reduce the noise contour.

1031
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,172
Again, like we did in the
numerical studies in the lab--

1032
00:49:11,172 --> 00:49:13,380
so we moved from the lab to
prototype and field test.

1033
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,922
But we also found
out that there were

1034
00:49:14,922 --> 00:49:19,440
incredible benefits in terms of
fuel savings and time savings.

1035
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,040
So it went from more than
just noise now become

1036
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,710
how do we design approach and
arrival procedures to deal

1037
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:26,060
with the environment?

1038
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,670
So following on this, when
I moved to Georgia Tech,

1039
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,490
we did it with it-- basically
took that flight trial.

1040
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:35,900
We made some improvements in
how we specify procedures,

1041
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,720
and then we end up designing
the arrival procedure, which

1042
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,710
everybody who has flown to
LA since 2007 has flown,

1043
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:46,220
which basically is the river
arrival into Los Angeles.

1044
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,290
And this one, we
had to actually then

1045
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:51,710
going now beyond just the higher
fidelity simulations and all

1046
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:53,480
the modeling, we
know how to do things

1047
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,068
like if you're going to
change the procedure,

1048
00:49:56,068 --> 00:49:58,110
you have to make sure that
the pilot doesn't have

1049
00:49:58,110 --> 00:49:59,880
more than four or
five button pushes

1050
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,480
because if you have them down on
the screen in their mode control

1051
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,270
panel button pushing to
change the runway from 25

1052
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:10,760
left to 25 right, you're going
to have some safety issues.

1053
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,950
So we had to incorporate
all of these things.

1054
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:15,580
And again, even though I
wasn't on the safety side,

1055
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:21,130
like Amy was, the lessons that
we learned in ASO, now ICAP,

1056
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:23,300
basically helped us
design this procedure.

1057
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,970
And what you can see now
at the bottom right--

1058
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:28,920
and I won't go into the details
of all this-- but besides,

1059
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,830
we were able to meter this
traffic coming out from Arizona,

1060
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:34,960
and we were able to
keep these airplanes

1061
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,380
and optimize their speeds.

1062
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:39,340
And the bottom left,
you will see basically

1063
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,900
how we all the
simulations we did

1064
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,440
to make sure that every aircraft
type could stay in VNAV mode

1065
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,050
from top of descent all
the way to the runway.

1066
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,000
And on the right,
you see the savings

1067
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,150
that we're saving about $22
billion in benefits in 2018.

1068
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:57,060
And this procedure has now
spread across the world.

1069
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:01,820
So from that conversation
and a concept--

1070
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,110
from lab to prototype
to the real world--

1071
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:08,220
and it continues because
my student and his student,

1072
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,750
John's grandchild and
his great grandchild,

1073
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:16,940
went on to do work and
develop some [INAUDIBLE]

1074
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,420
algorithms-- so actually
jointly set the spacing

1075
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,860
and the sequences for arrivals.

1076
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,100
And this can be
executed in Excel.

1077
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,240
Again, making it simple.

1078
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:31,200
So that's a pebble that's
turned into a pearl.

1079
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,780
Another pebble that
turned into a pearl

1080
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,970
is in surface operations.

1081
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,980
And this was in 1999.

1082
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,480
And there are a
couple of people who

1083
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,280
are in the room here Hasnie
Idris, Llenas Anagnostakis,

1084
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,190
John Amadio, et cetera, who
were involved in this project.

1085
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:49,020
This was a departure
plan of project.

1086
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,100
It was a blue sky.

1087
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,046
Look at how do we change
surface operations.

1088
00:51:54,046 --> 00:51:56,575

1089
00:51:56,575 --> 00:51:58,200
And much of the work
there was actually

1090
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,680
analyzing the operations at
Logan, at different airports

1091
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,250
and seeing and also
looking at the reports

1092
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,780
to see where were the biggest
sources of congestion,

1093
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,730
what were the constraints.

1094
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:13,810
And everybody would say,
well, gates and their runways.

1095
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:16,000
But on the bottom
left was probably

1096
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,490
one of the most
interesting results,

1097
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:21,250
that the air traffic
controllers were themselves

1098
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:26,880
a constraint because there is a
flow of aircraft on the surface,

1099
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,770
but in the air
traffic control tower,

1100
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,040
there's a flow of flight strips.

1101
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,375
And when an air traffic
controller is overloaded,

1102
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:36,000
they're going to say, wait, I'm
not going to give that command.

1103
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,300
So the airplane might be ready,
but the air traffic controller

1104
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:38,850
isn't.

1105
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,750
So those two flows
have to be synchronized

1106
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,117
if you want to have a
properly functioning system.

1107
00:52:44,117 --> 00:52:46,200
And we're doing stuff at
electronic flight strips,

1108
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,910
et cetera, to try
to deal with that.

1109
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:51,020
But we also saw some
other interesting results.

1110
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:54,650
The middle one and the
bottom shows this behavior

1111
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,180
which became swapping.

1112
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,610
So when you push back two
airplanes at the same time,

1113
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,270
it's a race to an intersection.

1114
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:04,790
Any uncertainty
in the taxi speed

1115
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,860
gets magnified because
if I get in front of you,

1116
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:11,270
I have a minute or 45 seconds
at the very least ahead of you

1117
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,150
before I take off.

1118
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,210
So for years, we
couldn't figure out

1119
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,430
how to accurately
predict taxi time.

1120
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:19,550
That's swapping behavior
allowed us to actually

1121
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:22,760
be able to [INAUDIBLE]
to actually figure out

1122
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,500
how to better predict
the taxi times.

1123
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,560
And then, of course,
on the bottom right,

1124
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,600
you'll see that
there's non-linearity.

1125
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:34,157
The more you push on the
aircraft and out in the system

1126
00:53:34,157 --> 00:53:36,740
is the more congestion, the more
delay and the longer the taxi

1127
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:37,350
times.

1128
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,600
And we actually saw some
interesting behavior,

1129
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,900
[INAUDIBLE] and
Ferran, that actually

1130
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,540
if throughput actually went
down, it didn't just stabilize.

1131
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,220
But when you have
too many airplanes,

1132
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,650
it's just total chaos.

1133
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,270
And you have blockages, and
the throughput went down.

1134
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,400
So this led to
the work that John

1135
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,000
went on to do with Hamza
and Tom Reynolds et al

1136
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,860
at the pushback rate
and got this picture

1137
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:04,880
courtesy of Bill Latent
via Hamza of them at Logan.

1138
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:12,250
Again, from concept, two field
trials where they actually

1139
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,770
did regulate the
pushback rate to keep

1140
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:17,900
the rate of the number of
planes that are taxiing out.

1141
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,700
And you can see top right,
all the airplanes in green

1142
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,200
piled up at Logan.

1143
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,400
Bottom left, basically, you'll
see a much cleaner taxiway

1144
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,090
and a shorter queue.

1145
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:32,750
And you had significant savings
in both time and fuel burn,

1146
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:34,700
et cetera, from that as well.

1147
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,410
Now that continues because
now NASA is actually

1148
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:40,960
doing a much larger
field trial and actually

1149
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,810
implementation and daily
of ATD-2, where they're

1150
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:46,150
doing a technology
demonstration, where they're

1151
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:51,350
actually doing this rate
control for Charlotte

1152
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:53,010
and a bunch of other airports.

1153
00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:55,580
And Tom and Hamza are
still involved basically

1154
00:54:55,580 --> 00:55:01,760
doing analysis and determining
on the bottom right, basically,

1155
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,258
what the optimum
amount of buffer

1156
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,800
that you could-- need to put in
there to determine the answer

1157
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:11,030
to manage the uncertainty--
so again, from the concept

1158
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:15,080
to the prototype to
basically real world,

1159
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,590
from a pebble to the
pearl, so two pearls.

1160
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:21,290
So let me talk about
the last pearl, which

1161
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:23,240
doesn't have a direct
hand-to-hand trace,

1162
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,730
but it has through
academic lineage.

1163
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:29,560
And this is looking at eVTOLs
and urban air mobility,

1164
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:32,710
and how do we deal with
environmental and noise

1165
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:36,790
in particular, because turns out
that FAA person is still that--

1166
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:40,070
Neanderthal, is still
there, still chiseling away,

1167
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,775
complaining to the
FAA about noise.

1168
00:55:41,775 --> 00:55:44,450

1169
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:45,140
It's tough.

1170
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,740

1171
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:53,830
So when you look at integrating
the cool new airplanes that John

1172
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:56,950
Langford and Brian are
bringing to the world

1173
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:59,490
into the urban environment,
there are lots of challenges.

1174
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,420
Of course, noise is one.

1175
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,490
There's safety.

1176
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:06,350
There's availability of
takeoff and landing areas.

1177
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:08,390
There's scalability of
the air traffic control.

1178
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:09,675
And Craig talked about that.

1179
00:56:09,675 --> 00:56:11,800
And there there's also the
ground and communication

1180
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,490
infrastructure.

1181
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:13,700
All of these things exist.

1182
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,570
But the one thing that
when you do the analysis

1183
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:19,870
and you speak to people who are
in the industry is that noise

1184
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:23,270
persists no matter
what the level is.

1185
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:26,590
Even if it's just one eVTOL
or one aircraft flying

1186
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:29,720
over your house, people
are still annoyed.

1187
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,400
And then you have
multiple [INAUDIBLE]

1188
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,840
annoying more and more people.

1189
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,140
By the way, I do want to invent
a new sport for the Olympics

1190
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,105
called drone shooting.

1191
00:56:37,105 --> 00:56:39,740

1192
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,770
And you should have one set
of programmers programming

1193
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:45,080
the drone to avoid the shots
and another one program

1194
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,330
it to be a great-- have
offense and defense.

1195
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:50,190
So you heard it here on that.

1196
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:52,970
So one of the things
that my postdoc and some

1197
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:55,580
of my students and I have been
working on and also colleagues

1198
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,040
at UT is basically
looking at a holistic

1199
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,500
again, back to that
holistic viewpoint

1200
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,500
that we were all taught
by John and looking

1201
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,130
at how do we manage noise.

1202
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,150
But we also have to think
about how do we manage energy.

1203
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:11,750
And how do we also make sure
that we fulfill the demand

1204
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:12,780
that we have?

1205
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,070
And so we came up with
this network flow problem

1206
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,230
where we're looking
at Austin, Texas,

1207
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,310
because we know a
lot about Austin.

1208
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,280
And we're right there.

1209
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,150
And we created basically
three air routes

1210
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:28,510
that basically mask
or over highways

1211
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:30,370
or cut across neighborhoods
where you have

1212
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:32,200
significant industrial areas.

1213
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,660
Or you had differences that
sometimes it's easy to fly over.

1214
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,700
Other times, it's not.

1215
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,620
And then we looked
and said, how do we

1216
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:42,250
optimize all of these
jointly for noise, energy,

1217
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,240
and for package delivery?

1218
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,420
And we can limit the operations.

1219
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,520
If you can fly,
you're going to limit.

1220
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,780
Or you can go to
a higher altitude.

1221
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,340
It's going to cost
you more energy.

1222
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:55,420
Or you can fly along
routes where there's noise,

1223
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,890
like highways, et cetera.

1224
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:59,860
And so we did this where
we had created this network

1225
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:03,910
with 63 nodes, three
cruising altitudes, 270

1226
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:05,710
directional links,
and 19 vertiports

1227
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:07,040
for the city of Austin.

1228
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,290
And we basically studied.

1229
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:10,730
And I won't go
into the equations.

1230
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:15,290
I hid that slide because it's a
nonlinear optimization problem.

1231
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:17,590
But in the end,
what you get is you

1232
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:22,910
can see here how the
noise and the energy usage

1233
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:26,712
change as you basically give
different weighting functions

1234
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:27,420
to what you want.

1235
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:30,500
So if you have no noise
control, these vehicles

1236
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,320
are going to just fly at the
lowest altitude they can,

1237
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,450
basically from A to B, and
they'll make a lot of noise.

1238
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:39,390
However, if you have more
stringent noise control,

1239
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,470
you can see here that
the community noise

1240
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:43,280
exposure is lower.

1241
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,140
And the reaction of the
community is going to be lower,

1242
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,380
but you won't be able to
fulfill as much demand.

1243
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,960
And so we also looked
at prioritizing noise

1244
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,160
and prioritizing energy and
seeing how those traded off.

1245
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,450
And then finally,
we came up, looked

1246
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:01,720
at some nice theoretical
issues of matters of fairness,

1247
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,910
where there was
utilitarian, egalitarian,

1248
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:05,070
and we showed how bad.

1249
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:08,130
So we have developed a tool,
which basically can allow you

1250
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:09,880
to determine how your network.

1251
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,250
So with that-- see,
I'm saying my thing--

1252
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:18,300
I want to summarize by saying
it really does take a pebble.

1253
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:22,620
And that pebble, in the
form of our Jon Huntsman,

1254
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:26,020
has two really, from my
mind, critical attributes,

1255
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,850
critical thinking and
a holistic viewpoint.

1256
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:33,060
And to my mind, these
skills are critical

1257
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,820
for us going forward
in tackling the most--

1258
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:38,010
the really important
problems that we have

1259
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:40,030
in aviation today and tomorrow.

1260
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:41,762
Thank you.

1261
00:59:41,762 --> 00:59:46,181
[APPLAUSE]

1262
00:59:46,181 --> 01:00:04,870

1263
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:07,720
Stand by.

1264
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,980
Wrong document open.

1265
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,670

1266
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,470
All right.

1267
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:17,220
Aviation in the age
of John Hansman--

1268
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,650
the first thing I thought
about this, especially

1269
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:22,990
from the perspective
of aircraft design,

1270
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:26,370
is what is the age
of John Hansman?

1271
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:32,070
So John Hansman, as we
all know, 70 years old.

1272
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,660
That's one Hansman.

1273
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:38,840
And you all may be thinking,
hey, John's not going anywhere.

1274
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,790
And it's true.

1275
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:41,050
John's not going anywhere.

1276
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:46,540
But MIT has a long and proud
tradition of making up units.

1277
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:49,020
And so I would
refer you to Smoots.

1278
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,570
When they were defining the
Smoot, no one said, hey,

1279
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:54,310
Smoot might get taller.

1280
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:55,730
They just painted the lines.

1281
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:56,980
And so I'm painting the lines.

1282
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:01,180
And so one Hansman is
now henceforth 70 years.

1283
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:04,650
So we're going to talk about
one Hansman worth of aircraft

1284
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:05,520
design.

1285
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,950
We're actually going to
talk about two Hansmans

1286
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:10,020
worth of aircraft design.

1287
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,290
And because you all know
that I am a future thinker

1288
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:16,230
and I'm actually up here
to talk about the future

1289
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:19,120
at a lecture that's
about history,

1290
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,780
we're going to talk
about three Hansmans.

1291
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:27,930
So my job is to use history
in this Gardner lecture

1292
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,370
to forecast what
the future might be.

1293
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:35,050
So if we actually go a little
bit over to Hansmans ago,

1294
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:38,000
the Europeans first started
thinking about flying machines,

1295
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,510
actually the Brits,
Cayley and Hinson there

1296
01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:45,040
and of course, Lilienthal, very
initially successful attempts

1297
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,560
to fly gliders, unpowered
aircraft, and of course,

1298
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,480
Lilienthal after
thousands of flights,

1299
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,780
ended up, unfortunately, in an
accident of his own creation

1300
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:57,820
and ended up dying in flight.

1301
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,190
Following those
in the late 1800s,

1302
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:03,130
groups of engineers got together
in Europe and they started

1303
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:06,190
to think about, how do we
actually power these things?

1304
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,980
Because people had started to
realize that flying machines

1305
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:12,050
were possible, but it wasn't so
obvious how do you power them.

1306
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:15,070
And so that was the first
international aviation Congress.

1307
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:18,550
And I found this very
interesting too is before

1308
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:22,510
airplanes actually worked,
lawyers got together and figured

1309
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:26,810
out in the late 1800s
how to regulate them.

1310
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:27,710
That's actually true.

1311
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:28,520
You could look that up.

1312
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,860
I checked it a bunch of times.

1313
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:33,500
You're going to have to-- if
you don't believe me, blame JT.

1314
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,780
So what usually happens
when the Europeans get

1315
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:39,670
thinking about
things is American

1316
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:43,250
entrepreneurs showed
up and made it real.

1317
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:45,500
And this is my
version of history.

1318
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,190
And so of course, the
Wright brothers in 1903

1319
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:54,220
were inside of two Hansmans now,
followed by the first autonomous

1320
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:57,500
airplane during World War I.

1321
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,540
These aircraft actually
went one direction.

1322
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,780
They did not come home.

1323
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:06,410
The first commercial aircraft,
the US Mail Service, of course,

1324
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:07,420
started to fly these.

1325
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:11,710
In a little bit over 20 years
following the Wright brothers,

1326
01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:15,430
of course, Charles Lindbergh
flew across the Atlantic

1327
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:18,400
and reduced the time
to cross the Atlantic

1328
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,120
by an order of magnitude.

1329
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,090
And I bet you that
when they first flew,

1330
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:25,240
the Wright brothers, no one
thought that was possible

1331
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,218
20 years later.

1332
01:03:26,218 --> 01:03:27,260
So that's 20 years later.

1333
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:27,968
Let's keep going.

1334
01:03:27,968 --> 01:03:30,910
1930s Frank Whittle and
the first jet engine start

1335
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:31,790
to appear.

1336
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:34,310
1940s-- I'm skipping
over a lot of history--

1337
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:35,840
many airplanes in World War II.

1338
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:37,720
Of course, we ended up
breaking the sound--

1339
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,762
the sound barrier and the
first supersonic flight

1340
01:03:39,762 --> 01:03:45,380
and the X-1 in 1952, the world's
first commercial jetliner.

1341
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:50,050
OK, so that's the first
of three Hansmans.

1342
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:56,140
1884 through 1954 was really
defined by invention and wartime

1343
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,080
innovation.

1344
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:58,750
We went from the
Wright brothers,

1345
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,550
through two world
wars, radial engines

1346
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:03,760
tapered and tapered wings,
retractable landing gears

1347
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,610
were invented.

1348
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:06,080
Aluminum airframes
were invented.

1349
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,180
We had the first
radio navigation aids.

1350
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,730
We had refinement of
the first flight decks.

1351
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:12,230
We broke the sound barrier.

1352
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:13,820
We invented jet propulsion.

1353
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:15,320
We had rocket propulsion.

1354
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,050
I can go on and on and on.

1355
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:21,480
OK, what's the second Hansman?

1356
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,160
So John Hansman
was born in 1954,

1357
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,690
which happened to be the date of
the first flight of my favorite

1358
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:29,890
airplane, the Boeing 367-80.

1359
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:33,450
This was when Boeing
was incredibly bold

1360
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:38,310
and bet the entire company
on the prototyping of a jet

1361
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:41,640
airliner to prove to
customers and to themselves

1362
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,040
that this was a product
that could meet what

1363
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,380
the market needed
and would create

1364
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:49,080
a whole new industry that people
had started dreaming about

1365
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,160
around this time period.

1366
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,930
So 1954 is the first
flight of that prototype.

1367
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:57,250
1957 is the first flight of the
commercial variant, the 707,

1368
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,470
which ends up
going into service.

1369
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:02,890
Competitors start to show
up the Douglas DC 8, 1958.

1370
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:05,620
The 1960s are so unbelievable.

1371
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:08,430
I had to just double check
the facts here again.

1372
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:10,330
Imagine living in
the age of this,

1373
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:14,500
where 1963, the first
flight of the Boeing 727,

1374
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,770
starts to cannibalize
the airplane products

1375
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:18,340
that they had just created.

1376
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:21,890
1967, the 787 was flown
for the first time.

1377
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:25,930
1969, the first wide
body airplanes, the 747

1378
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:27,470
opens up the whole world.

1379
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:31,640
Global connectivity,
1969 supersonic flight.

1380
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,810
Sorry, John, maybe a
little bit of a fool's

1381
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:35,060
errand there for a little bit.

1382
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,820
It can't all be straight
down the middle.

1383
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:38,660
Yeah.

1384
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:39,920
Yeah, exactly.

1385
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,460
So this I will recognize is
an aviation-centric talk.

1386
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:45,990
I'm talking to MITR department.

1387
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:47,460
A bunch of space stuff happened.

1388
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,370
I'm not going to talk about it.

1389
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,630
If you're interested
in this, once again,

1390
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:53,930
please talk to John Telco
sitting right in the center

1391
01:05:53,930 --> 01:05:54,330
here.

1392
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:56,038
He will answer your
questions about that.

1393
01:05:56,038 --> 01:05:57,040
Things happen in space.

1394
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:03,140
1970s, Airbus--
Airbus shows up A300--

1395
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:06,950
so widebody, 1979 MD-80.

1396
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:10,550
1971 entrepreneurs
start to show up.

1397
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:13,550
Herb Keller creates
this radical new idea

1398
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:18,690
in Texas for a low-cost
commercial airline.

1399
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:22,550
And he was trying to
figure out in that version

1400
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:24,560
of the regulatory
environment, how do you even

1401
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,850
make this thing possible?

1402
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:27,860
And so he was--

1403
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,250
look up the history
of Southwest.

1404
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,625
It's incredible the things
that they were doing in Texas.

1405
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:35,310
Only of course, followed
up by 1978, Jimmy Carter,

1406
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:38,310
the signing of the
Airline Deregulation Act,

1407
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:43,290
which created a whole new
world for commercial aviation.

1408
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:48,470
1980s, Airbus A320-- the first
glass flight decks and digital

1409
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:51,440
fly by wire airplanes, the rise
of computerized reservation

1410
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,400
systems and revenue management.

1411
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,510
Of course, the MIT
Department here ended up

1412
01:06:56,510 --> 01:07:00,320
playing a huge role in the
mathematics behind revenue

1413
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,180
management and all the systems
that we use today for those.

1414
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:06,270
The rise of turbofans-- so
turbojets are going away.

1415
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:10,670
We've discovered that we can
use high bypass ratio fans.

1416
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:12,030
CFM is created.

1417
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:14,690
Boeing creates two
new airplane products

1418
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:18,750
in that decade, the
757 and the 767.

1419
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:22,070
I'm not going to keep doing that
because you'll get tired of it.

1420
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:25,710
And it also turns out that
from 1990 until today,

1421
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:28,940
it's actually very
difficult to continue

1422
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,360
doing the decades there.

1423
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:33,240
What ended up happening
following the '90s, of course,

1424
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:37,570
the 777, the 787, the
A350, so on and so forth.

1425
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:41,400
From 1990 onwards, it was
just relentless innovation

1426
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,478
on so many fronts across
the Brigade range equation.

1427
01:07:44,478 --> 01:07:46,270
So if you just go back
to first principles,

1428
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,640
it was higher bypass
ratio engines.

1429
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,560
It was geared turbofans,
new materials,

1430
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:53,370
advanced combustors, low
noise in the engine space.

1431
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:56,250
In the aerospace,
it was CFD fuselage

1432
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:59,070
shaping winglets, supercritical
airfoils, vortex generators,

1433
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:00,690
and structures.

1434
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,350
We created computer
aided design.

1435
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:05,230
We used composites and automated
fiber placement machines.

1436
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:07,680
That's just on the
Brigade technologies.

1437
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,620
You just heard so much from
Amy and the other presenters

1438
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:13,650
about the pilot support
and automation tools.

1439
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:15,100
We had more fly by wire.

1440
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,490
We had glass flight decks,
auto T casts, ETOPS.

1441
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:21,630
ETOPS started to make the world
connected in a much more--

1442
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,140
a better way.

1443
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,170
We had Huds, GPS, wide
area augmentation systems,

1444
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:30,430
precision NAV on and on,
market trends, globalization,

1445
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:33,450
airline consolidation,
LCCs, I can go on.

1446
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:35,140
What does it look
like in the data?

1447
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:40,510
So from 1954, the year that
John was born, till now,

1448
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:44,319
we went from around 0 commercial
passengers approximately--

1449
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,270
it wasn't 0--

1450
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:48,885
to over 4 billion
annual passengers.

1451
01:08:48,885 --> 01:08:51,010
I cut off the pandemic
there because of the big dip

1452
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:52,649
but just to make the point.

1453
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:55,979
Since 1954, fuel
efficiency has improved

1454
01:08:55,979 --> 01:09:02,859
by over 80% Since 1954,
many airlines were created.

1455
01:09:02,859 --> 01:09:04,920
Many airlines were consolidated.

1456
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,319
Since 1954, all that
revenue management

1457
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:09,750
work turned into much
better utilization

1458
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,970
of the airplanes,
this load factor,

1459
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:15,600
over time and now,
which is over 80%.

1460
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,990
Since 1954, prices
have come down,

1461
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:21,960
have come down substantially,
even through world events

1462
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:24,399
where you would think that
prices wouldn't come down.

1463
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:27,782
Since 1954, Amy just showed us
accident rates have come down.

1464
01:09:27,782 --> 01:09:30,240
And if you take away some of
those-- some of the other bars

1465
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,907
there and you just
look at it from 1970,

1466
01:09:31,907 --> 01:09:34,170
the trend is even more
clear that accident rates

1467
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,439
have fallen dramatically.

1468
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:40,180
So during that Hansman,
what does that look like?

1469
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,810
That looks like global
connectivity, safety,

1470
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:43,593
and efficiency.

1471
01:09:43,593 --> 01:09:45,010
That's what that
era is all about.

1472
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:47,080
It's the dawn of
commercial aviation.

1473
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,460
It's the invention of every
single airliner happened

1474
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,080
during that Hansman.

1475
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:58,980
The scaling of a whole industry,
the optimization of all

1476
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:03,150
the operations, the global
economic impact of building all

1477
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:05,970
those airplanes, of
running all those airlines,

1478
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:08,470
the safety improvements
that we talked about,

1479
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,530
the relentless technology
optimizing, 9/11,

1480
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:14,970
which was maybe the biggest
impulse into the system from

1481
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:18,090
a safety standpoint, from
an operational standpoint,

1482
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:21,780
airline consolidations,
the market maturity,

1483
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,260
and ultimately
delivering a system,

1484
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,450
which I still view
as a modern miracle.

1485
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:26,290
It's really cool.

1486
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:27,990
I still to this
day get really mad

1487
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:30,990
when people close their blinds
when we're on an airplane

1488
01:10:30,990 --> 01:10:33,870
because I want to say--
thank you for clapping.

1489
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:35,912
So I want to say,
don't you get it?

1490
01:10:35,912 --> 01:10:36,870
Didn't you look around?

1491
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:40,630
You're paying $100 to fly across
the country in a tube in the sky

1492
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:42,170
at 500 miles an hour.

1493
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:43,010
It's amazing.

1494
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:45,220
So that happened
during that Hansman.

1495
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:47,340
What happens in
the next Hansman?

1496
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:47,840
All right.

1497
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:49,918
That's what I think
my job was here today,

1498
01:10:49,918 --> 01:10:51,710
but I needed to get
through all that first.

1499
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:56,780
So I think I reflect on that,
and I say a lot can happen.

1500
01:10:56,780 --> 01:10:58,668
It's hard to say in one hand.

1501
01:10:58,668 --> 01:10:59,960
I'm going to keep laughing now.

1502
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:04,340
A lot can happen in one Hansman,
and it's really, really,

1503
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,570
really hard to predict.

1504
01:11:05,570 --> 01:11:07,510
If you started at
the start of that,

1505
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:09,730
you would not possibly
end up at the end

1506
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:11,990
of either of those
stories that I told you.

1507
01:11:11,990 --> 01:11:13,820
But it's a fool's errand.

1508
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:14,990
It's what my job is here.

1509
01:11:14,990 --> 01:11:16,210
I'm a fool, and
I'm on an errand.

1510
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:17,918
And I'm going to make
predictions anyway.

1511
01:11:17,918 --> 01:11:21,830
And so I think the next Hansman
is about these three things.

1512
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:23,570
I think it's about
sustainability.

1513
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:26,050
And I think that and the
way I view that as I think

1514
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:27,470
that efficiency still matters.

1515
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:29,637
And I'm going to talk about
what that means briefly.

1516
01:11:29,637 --> 01:11:31,510
But getting to zero
climate impact,

1517
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:35,110
I think is going to end up
mattering more over time.

1518
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:37,430
I think it's going
to be about autonomy,

1519
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:41,240
both automation,
where to Amy's point,

1520
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:45,110
humans and automation
are working together,

1521
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:48,490
both on and off the aircraft,
including in the air traffic

1522
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:49,930
control environment.

1523
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:52,990
And I think that we will start
to see the rise of autonomous

1524
01:11:52,990 --> 01:11:56,380
aircraft, commercial
aircraft over this Hansman,

1525
01:11:56,380 --> 01:12:01,270
and I think we're going to see
really amazing combinations

1526
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:04,520
of these things that are just
simply impossible to predict,

1527
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,340
standing at the
start of this Hansman

1528
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:08,830
and wondering what it's going
to look like at the end.

1529
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:12,580
So on sustainability
today, today, 39 million

1530
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:16,030
annual flights, 1.1 gigatons
of CO2 equivalent emissions,

1531
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:19,820
and 2.5% is aviation
share of global emissions.

1532
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:23,500
Despite all the unbelievable
miracle of science statistics

1533
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:26,200
that I just showed you,
aviation's emissions

1534
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:30,280
have been rising despite
the 80% fuel efficiency

1535
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:31,640
improvements over time.

1536
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,430
And that's because
growth in aviation

1537
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:37,420
is outpacing our ability to make
the aircraft more efficient,

1538
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,290
and that growth is good.

1539
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:41,240
It means that people
want to travel.

1540
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,880
We should still continue
to allow people to travel,

1541
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,560
but we've got to
pick up the pace.

1542
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,420
So aviation's pace share
of global emissions

1543
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:52,510
is actually growing over time,
despite all those improvements

1544
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:53,690
that I just mentioned.

1545
01:12:53,690 --> 01:12:56,200
It's not because
aviation's not improving.

1546
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,270
Again, it's because we're flying
more than our improvements are

1547
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:00,770
coming in.

1548
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:04,450
And also, many other industries
are decarbonizing faster

1549
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:05,330
than aviation.

1550
01:13:05,330 --> 01:13:07,400
So this number is
going to keep going up.

1551
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,630
Our 2.5% today is going to
be a bigger number tomorrow,

1552
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:11,720
and that's a problem.

1553
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,240
So where are the emissions?

1554
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,900
John and I had done quite
a lot of research in this.

1555
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:20,620
When I was in ICAT, I actually
took this more recent data,

1556
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:23,620
2019 from the cascade team,
which I'll give a shout out here

1557
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:25,150
in a second.

1558
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:30,460
But this is aircraft histogram
of flights by aircraft

1559
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:32,180
type over certain missions.

1560
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:35,380
And you can see that most
of the available time

1561
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:37,540
kilometers in the
system are provided

1562
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:42,030
by widebodies and by single
aisle aircraft, obviously.

1563
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:45,720
So if you start looking at where
are the potential emissions

1564
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,132
reduction opportunity,
I'm obviously

1565
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:49,590
going to talk in
just a second here

1566
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,510
about the opportunity
of electrification

1567
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:52,770
and some other things.

1568
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:58,050
And if we look in the-- call
it sub-500 nautical mile space,

1569
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:00,340
it's about 14% of
the total emissions.

1570
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:01,600
And so this is great.

1571
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,090
We have a lot of
innovations that

1572
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:07,000
can start to address this market
space with electrification.

1573
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,370
There's a huge addressable
flight opportunity,

1574
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:11,460
which makes it a great
business opportunity,

1575
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,860
because and that's why you
see a lot of companies coming

1576
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:16,277
into this space because man,
that's a lot of flights to go

1577
01:14:16,277 --> 01:14:17,650
potentially try to address.

1578
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:19,960
But it has a disproportionately
limited impact.

1579
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,390
Even if we electrify every
single one of those flights,

1580
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:24,940
we've only solved
14% of the problem.

1581
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:27,490
We have another 80%
of the problem to go.

1582
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:29,800
So where are all those?

1583
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,530
And I can go on and
on about this subject.

1584
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:34,110
But I'll just
briefly say, if you

1585
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:36,600
look at widebodies
as just one example,

1586
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:40,330
they're somewhere around call
it half the fuel and about 10%

1587
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:41,030
of the flights.

1588
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:42,730
So if you want to
address the problem,

1589
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:47,050
you've got have got to address
how this segment of the market

1590
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:47,840
is powered.

1591
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,520
And it's not just how the
emissions out of the tailpipe

1592
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,340
of the aircraft.

1593
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:55,270
One of the things that we've
been doing in especially

1594
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:57,400
and what you'll see
in a second in a tool

1595
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,162
that I'm about to show
you is that we have

1596
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:01,370
to think beyond the aircraft.

1597
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:05,060
We have to think about aviation
as a system of systems problem.

1598
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:07,220
Where do you get the
source of the energy?

1599
01:15:07,220 --> 01:15:08,420
How do you carry it?

1600
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,620
How is it transported?

1601
01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:11,440
How do you use it
on the airplane

1602
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,570
and ultimately get to
the total climate impact?

1603
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:17,200
So how do we do the full
life cycle accounting

1604
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,770
of all the climate effects?

1605
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:21,820
So something that the
Boeing team is now

1606
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:25,000
leading that I was
really proud was really

1607
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,490
a derivative of the work of--

1608
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:31,420
I think now decades
of thinking in ICAT

1609
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:34,690
is how to create tools that
bring all of that together

1610
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:37,190
in a quantifiable way that.

1611
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:39,240
Is truthful, that's
based on the facts.

1612
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,850
It's not based on people's
feelings about sustainability,

1613
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:43,970
but it's based on
the literal facts

1614
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:46,830
of doing all the math of the
system that I just showed you.

1615
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:48,330
And that's a tool
that's now online,

1616
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:49,497
and you can go check it out.

1617
01:15:49,497 --> 01:15:51,560
And one of the
results of that is

1618
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,180
that it's going to take
a lot of different tools.

1619
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:56,960
So here's just sort
of a very simplified

1620
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,100
view of how I think things may
play out in the next Hansman

1621
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,360
era.

1622
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:05,420
I think there's going to be
very obviously new energy

1623
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:06,840
carriers on the left.

1624
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:10,120
So we're going to need massive
amounts of sustainable aviation

1625
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:10,620
fuel.

1626
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:11,370
That's obvious.

1627
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:13,730
There's no way through
the next couple of decades

1628
01:16:13,730 --> 01:16:16,700
unless we have tons and
tons of sustainable aviation

1629
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,593
fuel that doesn't exist today.

1630
01:16:18,593 --> 01:16:20,510
And that's going to take
the form of biofuels,

1631
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:22,320
and it will take
the form of e-fuels.

1632
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,375
And there's a whole long
discussion about that.

1633
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:26,250
And the lab for Aviation
and the Environment,

1634
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:28,400
which John now
leads, by the way,

1635
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,520
that lab has been pioneers in
thinking about alternative fuels

1636
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,840
and so on.

1637
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:34,790
I think there's
opportunity for things

1638
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:38,960
like hydrogen, maybe
other fuels of this type,

1639
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:42,150
and obviously battery
electric and electrification.

1640
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:44,510
I think we're going to
see new aircraft shapes.

1641
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:48,440
One of the great things that
came out of the MIT Department

1642
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,520
over the last few decades
was the D8 program.

1643
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:53,175
And that's obviously the
first aircraft on the top

1644
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:54,800
there, which I'm very
passionate about,

1645
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,380
having spent many years on.

1646
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:01,157
I think that we're running out
of room on the tube and wing

1647
01:17:01,157 --> 01:17:03,740
aircraft to make the efficiency
improvements, which is why you

1648
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:06,410
see that chart that I showed.

1649
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:09,140
That marginal improvements
are getting smaller.

1650
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:11,750
And so I think that there's
opportunity for new aircraft

1651
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:12,440
shapes.

1652
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:13,940
And I think one of
the things that I

1653
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:17,120
was very passionate
about in my PhD research

1654
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,990
was this idea of
right sizing aircraft.

1655
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:21,830
And that's what John and I had
spent-- had spent quite a bit

1656
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:22,880
of time thinking about.

1657
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,270
Can you make aircraft that
are tailored specifically

1658
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:28,833
for the mission that they're
intending to operate?

1659
01:17:28,833 --> 01:17:30,500
And I think that's
where you're starting

1660
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:34,910
to see some of what people are
calling UAM or regional air

1661
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:38,370
mobility or these other
somewhat tortured terms.

1662
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:40,040
But what you're
seeing is aircraft

1663
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:43,430
that use particular new
energy carriers to have--

1664
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,390
to be more right
sized for the mission.

1665
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:48,470
So that gets to the
point where I show you

1666
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:51,380
a little bit of what that
actually looks like in practice.

1667
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:54,627
There's hundreds of companies
that are doing things like this.

1668
01:17:54,627 --> 01:17:56,460
I'm going to talk about
the one that I lead,

1669
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:00,620
which is the one that's in
the red box there called Wisk.

1670
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:02,318
John and Chris Korten
is around here.

1671
01:18:02,318 --> 01:18:03,860
They're going to
talk to you tomorrow

1672
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:05,820
about the other yellow airplane.

1673
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:07,430
They're called Electra.

1674
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:09,468
There are hundreds of these.

1675
01:18:09,468 --> 01:18:11,510
I just want to show you
a little bit about what's

1676
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:14,270
going on behind the hood
or under the hood, rather,

1677
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:19,400
in what are just incredibly
fun and entrepreneurial

1678
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,830
and engineering-driven
companies and cultures

1679
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,180
to build the things that
ultimately, I think,

1680
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:27,020
will start to matter for
the view of the Hansman

1681
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:29,420
that I just showed you there.

1682
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:31,620
We build autonomous
electric aircraft.

1683
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:34,310
There's a long history of the
company, which I don't have time

1684
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:37,933
to tell you, but this is
a fifth generation of one

1685
01:18:37,933 --> 01:18:39,600
of the airplanes that
we built. This one

1686
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,480
is actually flying down in New
Zealand that you can see there.

1687
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,600
These aircraft take
off vertically.

1688
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,370
They fly like an airplane.

1689
01:18:47,370 --> 01:18:49,900
And they stop, and they
land vertically again,

1690
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,720
like a helicopter.

1691
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:56,170
Our concept of operations is
autonomous with human oversight.

1692
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:58,570
I'll show you what that
looks like here in a second.

1693
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:01,360
These are battery
electric powered aircraft.

1694
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,420
The safety targets
are when you get

1695
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:07,710
into things doing the ARP
4754 and the VMCAs and so

1696
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:10,227
on, things like
catastrophic hazards

1697
01:19:10,227 --> 01:19:12,560
or 10 to the minus 9 delay,
no single points of failure,

1698
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,270
so on and so forth-- so
similar to commercial aircraft,

1699
01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:16,390
this aircraft.

1700
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:18,390
Now the problem with
battery electric airplanes,

1701
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:20,640
and what John will show you,
is an innovation tomorrow

1702
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,040
on this is that they
can't fly very far.

1703
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,080
So this airplane flies
less than 100 miles.

1704
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,730
It carries four people.

1705
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:29,410
And it charges quickly.

1706
01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:31,470
These are the kinds of
systems that are on board.

1707
01:19:31,470 --> 01:19:34,660
We are an incredibly
vertically integrated company.

1708
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:37,440
We make every--
nearly every system

1709
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,960
on the airplane, which
makes it very fun.

1710
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,530
So it's a composite airframe.

1711
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:43,900
It's actually a bonded
composite airframe.

1712
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:46,350
We use thing things like
SQRTM and some other out

1713
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:51,180
of autoclave technologies that
enable high-rate manufacturing.

1714
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:52,540
We build our own computers.

1715
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:55,680
We build our own software
for those computers.

1716
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,502
We build our own battery packs.

1717
01:19:57,502 --> 01:19:58,960
I'll show you what
those look like.

1718
01:19:58,960 --> 01:19:59,890
Electric motors.

1719
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:03,420
It's obviously a fully
electric fly by wire airplane,

1720
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:06,960
and sensing navigation
landing, I'll

1721
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,450
talk a little bit more
about just briefly.

1722
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:12,330
For those of you that
have an electric car,

1723
01:20:12,330 --> 01:20:15,570
it's a pretty amazing thing
when you really look inside

1724
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:16,720
of your electric car.

1725
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:19,300
These systems are
unbelievably simple.

1726
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:21,360
And so here I'm showing
just a little bit

1727
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,890
of what an airplane
looks like when

1728
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:24,633
there's no fuel in the wings.

1729
01:20:24,633 --> 01:20:26,800
This aircraft, obviously,
it doesn't have a turbine.

1730
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,270
It doesn't have
hydraulic systems.

1731
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:29,970
It doesn't have pneumatics.

1732
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:34,560
All that it has in big quotes
is high voltage harnessing, low

1733
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:37,140
voltage harnessing
batteries, motors.

1734
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:39,330
That's it, computers.

1735
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:41,070
The motors look like this.

1736
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:45,030
I think they're unbelievably
impressive, what you can

1737
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:47,400
create with electric machines.

1738
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,163
This has about the
same amount of power

1739
01:20:50,163 --> 01:20:52,080
that you would get in a
Lycoming engine that's

1740
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,980
on a small general
aviation aircraft.

1741
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:56,700
And it has very, very few parts.

1742
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:00,210
We're in the middle of
making all of that right now

1743
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:01,390
out in California.

1744
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:04,920
And we expect to be flying this
first version of the Gen six

1745
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,240
airplane within the
next couple of months.

1746
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,910
But that means that right now,
we're building all those battery

1747
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:09,400
packs.

1748
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,680
You can see up on
the top right there,

1749
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,060
the battery cells
that we use are

1750
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:14,640
similar to what's
in your cell phone.

1751
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:17,282
They're pouch cells that are
almost the same form factor

1752
01:21:17,282 --> 01:21:18,490
as what's in your cell phone.

1753
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:21,010
We put them in
aviation-safe battery packs,

1754
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:23,670
which is a whole very
interesting research subject.

1755
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:25,750
We make those motors
that I just showed you.

1756
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:28,410
We put it all on the ground and
complex things like ironbirds

1757
01:21:28,410 --> 01:21:30,760
and make sure the software
works and all the rest.

1758
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,470
We have to think way
beyond the airplane.

1759
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:33,803
I hope that you understand that.

1760
01:21:33,803 --> 01:21:36,480
Now, from the discussions that
we just had from Craig and JP

1761
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,750
and Amy.

1762
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:39,310
So these are all
the things that we

1763
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:41,380
have to pioneer in
order to advance

1764
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:43,250
our autonomous operations.

1765
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:46,210
Trust me, it would be it would
be many orders of magnitude

1766
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:49,300
easier if we were doing
this with a pilot on board.

1767
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:52,000
We're really trying to advance
all the enabling elements

1768
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,800
of this, what the
FAA is starting

1769
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:56,800
to call a super system
for autonomous operations.

1770
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,520
That starts to look like this.

1771
01:21:58,520 --> 01:21:59,950
I put this up here
because I think

1772
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:01,867
this is very interesting
to dovetail with what

1773
01:22:01,867 --> 01:22:05,230
Amy and team just showed is
that the way that aircraft

1774
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:07,090
may be supervised in the future.

1775
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:10,090
This is an actual picture
from how we actually

1776
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:11,330
supervise the airplanes.

1777
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:14,530
That's the word that
we use, that all

1778
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:18,780
of the human factors for how
that's done is new work to do.

1779
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:19,735
It's new research.

1780
01:22:19,735 --> 01:22:21,860
It needs to be done with
appropriate human factors.

1781
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:22,640
So that it's safe.

1782
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:27,190
It's a whole new world to go in
and derive lessons from the past

1783
01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:30,400
and apply them to the future.

1784
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,220
This is the FAA tech center in
New Jersey, which was really

1785
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:35,500
fun to be back to because
I think many of us

1786
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:38,370
went to the JUP talks with
Jon at the same center.

1787
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,120
And so we actually are
running simulations

1788
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,920
with the whisk
airplanes in there now.

1789
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:44,170
We take all our sensor
packages and compute

1790
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:46,700
and all the software
and whatnot,

1791
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:48,250
and we do things
detect and avoid

1792
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:50,535
trials on surrogate
helicopters in California

1793
01:22:50,535 --> 01:22:51,910
using many of the
lessons learned

1794
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:55,390
that John Langford taught
me while we were together

1795
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:57,230
at Aurora Flight Sciences.

1796
01:22:57,230 --> 01:23:01,360
And so it may not stop there.

1797
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:04,370
There may be things
that go beyond gen six,

1798
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:06,100
so things like
cargo and logistics

1799
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:08,440
and other electrified
products over time, which

1800
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,800
is really fun to think about.

1801
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,550
So bringing it back
to our timeline,

1802
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:16,990
I guess it is a little
bit of a fool's errand

1803
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:19,160
to try to predict the
future, as I mentioned.

1804
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,720
But if I have to I
would say it's probably

1805
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:27,280
the era of sustainability and
autonomy if I were guessing.

1806
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:29,680
And I will leave
with this, which

1807
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:33,160
is if I look back at
that history, what

1808
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:37,960
I see is that most
of the products

1809
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:40,780
that I showed you were
the successful ones.

1810
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:42,700
But when you really
pull the thread

1811
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:45,430
on the super
interesting innovations

1812
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:47,590
and people and
projects and companies

1813
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:50,440
and all the things that went
into creating all of those,

1814
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,250
almost all of them failed.

1815
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:55,420
And I would say that that's
probably the world that we're

1816
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:58,060
in right now where
it's not obvious

1817
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:01,040
what the ultimate landing place
is for all these technologies.

1818
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,610
It's not obvious what are
the successful products

1819
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:04,227
in this space.

1820
01:24:04,227 --> 01:24:06,310
It's not obvious what are
the successful companies

1821
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:07,540
in the space.

1822
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:10,090
But John taught us a
bunch of stuff, which is

1823
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:11,970
thinking from first principles.

1824
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:14,050
He taught us to consider
the whole system, which

1825
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:16,450
I hope you heard reflected
from our completely not

1826
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:18,760
coordinated talks today.

1827
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,740
He taught us to do
the work that matters,

1828
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:24,530
not just publishing papers
for publishing papers sake,

1829
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:28,090
but to try to drive those
numbers that I showed you

1830
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:30,490
on the slides ever
higher and lower,

1831
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:34,070
based on which direction is
good, and to adapt to change.

1832
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:37,180
And so I think we're
all pretty well teed up

1833
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,830
to go after the next Hansman.

1834
01:24:38,830 --> 01:24:39,330
Thanks.

1835
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:45,290

1836
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:46,040
What do we do now?

1837
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:51,780

1838
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:54,582
I forgot to mention all the
slides that was [INAUDIBLE].

1839
01:24:54,582 --> 01:25:03,250

1840
01:25:03,250 --> 01:25:06,670
Well, thank you so much for
those outstanding talks.

1841
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:08,770
We have a few minutes
for Q&A, so I'd

1842
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:12,010
like to invite our
speakers to come up,

1843
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:14,835
and we can open it
up to the audience.

1844
01:25:14,835 --> 01:25:17,510

1845
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:18,470
You can come on.

1846
01:25:18,470 --> 01:25:18,970
Yeah.

1847
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:26,070

1848
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:36,330
[INAUDIBLE]

1849
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:38,190
We have a mic here,
but John Langford

1850
01:25:38,190 --> 01:25:41,960
asked John Hansman, what does
the next Hansman look like?

1851
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:45,750
I think Brian's on target.

1852
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:49,180
And actually, this is
something I learned in Masha.

1853
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:51,160
One of my students,
Masha, who's here,

1854
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:54,030
is actually the person
who got me really to think

1855
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:55,890
about the sustainability part.

1856
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:59,790
So I think we're fundamentally
driven by sustainability

1857
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:01,360
as an industry and whatever.

1858
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,360
And the autonomy is obvious.

1859
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,730
It's actually autonomy and
optimization, whatever.

1860
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:11,150
So we're going to think
about the objective function.

1861
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:13,370
Whether the airframe, I think--

1862
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:15,620
I agree also with Brian that
we should build something

1863
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:18,000
like the D8, that
we're in an obsolete.

1864
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,290
We can't continue
to go the way we've

1865
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:25,130
been going right now if you
get the increased bypass ratio

1866
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:27,390
by making the engine bigger.

1867
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:30,080
We're sort of at the point
where the additional drag

1868
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,630
from the nacelle counteracts
the additional the improvement

1869
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:33,210
from that.

1870
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:36,630
So we need to take advantage
of configuration stuff there.

1871
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:40,910
But I think it's existential
to the aviation industry, which

1872
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:44,520
is if we don't become
more efficient,

1873
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,660
we will become marginalized,
and it will become

1874
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:50,280
socially unacceptable to fly.

1875
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,640
And the market will go away.

1876
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:54,180
So I think that's
the real driver.

1877
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:55,660
Autonomy, I think,
is a technology,

1878
01:26:55,660 --> 01:27:00,093
but we're going to use every
technology we can get and.

1879
01:27:00,093 --> 01:27:02,010
We do need to think of
it as a system problem.

1880
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:05,090
I also just want
to thank everybody.

1881
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:09,170
I think there are themes
that I didn't realize

1882
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:11,790
that I had that I've seen.

1883
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:13,190
But I think the
goal has actually

1884
01:27:13,190 --> 01:27:19,110
been to improve the
system and to have impact.

1885
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:22,610
And I think everybody here has.

1886
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:26,030
So I think we've done the
first part of the job.

1887
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:29,820
OK, I don't know if I
answered your question.

1888
01:27:29,820 --> 01:27:40,800

1889
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,663
No, no, I'll behave.

1890
01:27:42,663 --> 01:27:44,080
Brian, this is a
question for you.

1891
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:49,020
You mentioned that getting the
aircraft out there in the world

1892
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:51,030
would be orders of
magnitude easier if it

1893
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:53,250
didn't have to be autonomous.

1894
01:27:53,250 --> 01:27:54,960
From a business
perspective, are you

1895
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:00,720
ever tempted to find autonomous
or crewed or piloted markets

1896
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,800
for the airplane?

1897
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:06,388
One of the things that I
learned, maybe from Jon

1898
01:28:06,388 --> 01:28:07,930
Langford, actually--
and Jon, I don't

1899
01:28:07,930 --> 01:28:09,680
know if this is a
lesson that I don't even

1900
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,740
know if Jon would
agree with this now,

1901
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:14,350
but my reflection from
our time at Aurora

1902
01:28:14,350 --> 01:28:17,230
was that the idea of
having a piloted aircraft

1903
01:28:17,230 --> 01:28:19,390
and trying to turn it
into an uncrewed aircraft

1904
01:28:19,390 --> 01:28:21,010
or an optionally
piloted aircraft

1905
01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:22,450
as kind of a
pressure relief valve

1906
01:28:22,450 --> 01:28:24,550
for the regulatory
discussion and so on

1907
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:30,080
was never it never dealt
with the hard question.

1908
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:33,700
It never forced
the hard question.

1909
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:37,450
By really thinking holistically
about the whole concept

1910
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:42,010
of operations, we think we're
able to put forth to the FAA

1911
01:28:42,010 --> 01:28:44,300
the hard question in a
really responsible way.

1912
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:46,100
And then to just
take it head on.

1913
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:48,140
So from a business
standpoint, I mean,

1914
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:52,270
one of the advantages
that we've had

1915
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:54,640
is that we've had two very
long-term thinkers involved

1916
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:55,280
in the company.

1917
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,300
The company was founded
by Larry Page, obviously

1918
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,940
a very long-term
thinker, and then Boeing

1919
01:29:00,940 --> 01:29:03,900
came in as a joint
venture partner in 2019,

1920
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,940
fully acquired the
company last year.

1921
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:07,460
So we've been in
a position where

1922
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:10,130
we can take the longer view
and we don't necessarily

1923
01:29:10,130 --> 01:29:13,940
have to raise the next
round every month or so.

1924
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:17,180
But obviously, the
markets change.

1925
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:17,790
Times change.

1926
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,207
You could tell
Boeing's in crisis.

1927
01:29:19,207 --> 01:29:23,750
And so every entrepreneurial
journey is kind of we'll

1928
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:25,260
have to take things
as they come.

1929
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:25,950
So we'll see.

1930
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:29,790
But we have no current plan to
ever go to a piloted aircraft.

1931
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:32,240
We're trying to
force a hard question

1932
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:35,390
and honestly succeed
or fail and just face

1933
01:29:35,390 --> 01:29:37,110
into that on our
ability to do it.

1934
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:40,803
And if we fail, then we're
going to fail trying responsibly

1935
01:29:40,803 --> 01:29:41,970
to do it for the first time.

1936
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:43,470
And that's the way
it's going to go.

1937
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:45,970

1938
01:29:45,970 --> 01:29:47,760
We have time for
maybe one or two more.

1939
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,770

1940
01:29:51,770 --> 01:29:54,260
So I think this is for Amy.

1941
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,610
I was just wondering.

1942
01:29:55,610 --> 01:29:58,970
There was a talk about
automation versus pilot--

1943
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:01,880
pilot monitoring
and all that stuff.

1944
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,700
How often do you
think pilot actually

1945
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:09,560
does take over from autopilot
in the commercial industry

1946
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:13,520
right now that have saved--

1947
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:18,230
made it safer, so to speak,
in the context of going

1948
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:20,840
fully automatic versus not?

1949
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:23,660
Yeah, we're working in the
industry to collect data,

1950
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:28,200
and we're finding that
only about 10% of flights

1951
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:32,790
could be conducted totally on
autonomy without some pilot

1952
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:34,200
intervention.

1953
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:38,170
About 26% of flights have
some system malfunction,

1954
01:30:38,170 --> 01:30:40,830
requiring pilot
intervention to continue

1955
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:42,880
safe flight to the destination.

1956
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,870
And why has this not
reliably been logged?

1957
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:47,470
Because they're so common.

1958
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:51,600
The circuit breaker presses
that the pilot does regularly

1959
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,490
during the flight that
nobody reports it.

1960
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:55,240
You say the pilot, why
didn't you tell me?

1961
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,698
They're like, why
would I tell you.

1962
01:30:56,698 --> 01:30:58,300
This happens every day.

1963
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:04,180
So the rest include air traffic,
running fairly quick changes

1964
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:07,340
to the flight, disconnect.

1965
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:10,960
Let your buddy reprogram
the flight management system

1966
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:13,240
while you hand fly until
everything's reconfigured

1967
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:14,610
and take over.

1968
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:17,790
So we know that or
we are increasingly

1969
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:23,150
learning that our deterministic
model of the nominal flight

1970
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:26,700
is the mean, but the variance
around that in the flight,

1971
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:28,950
the amount of
variance, disturbance,

1972
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:32,030
operational disturbance, and
variation throughout any flight

1973
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:33,210
is profound.

1974
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:38,760
And right now, it is the
pilot who manages that.

1975
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:42,240
[INAUDIBLE] I think it's
sort of counterintuitive

1976
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,570
also why autonomous
and electric.

1977
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:48,690
And one of the things we found
through doing the full safety

1978
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:51,180
cases and so on is that
the fact that we can only

1979
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:54,690
fly for less than an hour
is actually quite good

1980
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:56,760
because we can
operationally restrict

1981
01:31:56,760 --> 01:32:01,670
so much of the actual complexity
of a large commercial aircraft.

1982
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:03,815
So I wouldn't want to
confound the solving

1983
01:32:03,815 --> 01:32:05,940
the problem with our smaller
plane and then saying,

1984
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:08,770
therefore it's solved for
large commercial airplanes.

1985
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:12,810
I would say we are solving
such a small portion

1986
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:14,710
of that big airplane problem.

1987
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:16,590
We're trying to do
what I've been telling

1988
01:32:16,590 --> 01:32:18,600
people is the Fosbury
flop, for people that

1989
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,360
know that term, the guy
who first jumped backwards

1990
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:22,900
over a high jump bar.

1991
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:25,440
We're trying to do that
for commercial passenger

1992
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,860
carrying autonomous aircraft.

1993
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:29,070
And the more we constrict
it-- restrict it

1994
01:32:29,070 --> 01:32:31,080
so that it looks like
a Gondola in the sky

1995
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:33,480
where you take the cable
away, that's the better

1996
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:36,550
off we're going to be.

1997
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:40,840
I appreciate Missy Cummings,
who surveyed pilots--

1998
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:43,060
this would have been
2018 time frame--

1999
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:46,210
and asked them how many
minutes in your average flight

2000
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:48,410
do you actually hand fly?

2001
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:51,770
And for the A320, the answer
was on two to three minutes.

2002
01:32:51,770 --> 01:32:54,590
For the 777, it was on
average seven minutes.

2003
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:59,830
This ended up a thing on Wolf
Blitzer, where Missy was going,

2004
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:01,490
these airplanes
are so automated.

2005
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:03,790
And I was glad that Missy
brought me in as her foil

2006
01:33:03,790 --> 01:33:07,070
because Wolf turns to me and
says, so we don't need pilots.

2007
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:09,250
And I said, well, those
two to seven minutes

2008
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,736
include takeoff, landing,
and every emergency.

2009
01:33:11,736 --> 01:33:17,540

2010
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:18,210
Last question.

2011
01:33:18,210 --> 01:33:24,440

2012
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:29,200
For Brian, but for all of you,
everyone mentioned the FAA,

2013
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:31,930
but not much mention
was made of regulation.

2014
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:35,400
Is the FAA, in your
opinion, as it's currently

2015
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:41,790
staffed and organized,
able to adequately enable

2016
01:33:41,790 --> 01:33:43,678
these futures for aviation?

2017
01:33:43,678 --> 01:33:45,970
Well, there's a tough word
in there, which is, I guess,

2018
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:48,577
adequately, or there's
adjectives in there

2019
01:33:48,577 --> 01:33:49,660
that are hard to describe.

2020
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:52,568
I would say that we're
headed down the road.

2021
01:33:52,568 --> 01:33:54,360
From my perspective,
just being a developer

2022
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:57,090
and seeing the kind
of front lines,

2023
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,280
the FAA doesn't have
all the expertise

2024
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:02,322
in the engineering
corps that's required

2025
01:34:02,322 --> 01:34:04,780
to deal with some of these
subjects because they're so new.

2026
01:34:04,780 --> 01:34:05,380
And it's OK.

2027
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:07,720
It's not because it's
a fault of their own.

2028
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:11,150
It's because they're
incredibly new.

2029
01:34:11,150 --> 01:34:12,900
I mean, this is a
National Academies thing

2030
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:15,390
that John and Amy and others
should, I think really

2031
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:17,550
think about is, how
do you get-- how

2032
01:34:17,550 --> 01:34:19,230
can you create an
incentive for people

2033
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:21,602
to go through some of these
really innovative programs

2034
01:34:21,602 --> 01:34:23,310
in industry and then
come back to the FAA

2035
01:34:23,310 --> 01:34:25,435
so that you understand the
technologies that you're

2036
01:34:25,435 --> 01:34:26,500
expected to regulate.

2037
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,600
So that's one thing.

2038
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:33,440
I think from a
staffing standpoint

2039
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:35,740
and so on, there's
just-- the FAA isn't

2040
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:38,740
the high the highest
performing organization

2041
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:42,290
in the world from just like
a responsiveness standpoint.

2042
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:44,560
I'd say most applicants
would tell you

2043
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:48,170
that the people that are really
running CERT programs would say,

2044
01:34:48,170 --> 01:34:51,640
my biggest frustration is
just the nuts and bolts

2045
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:56,110
of passing paper back and
forth and other things.

2046
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:57,920
I guess there's less
of a big theme there.

2047
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,545
But there is this
talent problem that I

2048
01:34:59,545 --> 01:35:01,030
think is there's
something really

2049
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:03,380
there for the National Academies
or somebody else to consider.

2050
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:05,500
But the air traffic control
you should talk about

2051
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:09,310
because I actually think
there's staffing problems.

2052
01:35:09,310 --> 01:35:11,260
I do think that there
are staffing problems

2053
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:14,760
in the CERT side
too, in that they're

2054
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,810
trying to run the
regular operation,

2055
01:35:16,810 --> 01:35:19,950
doing all the Boeing issues,
while at the same time,

2056
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:22,060
you have a ton of
other new entrants.

2057
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:25,740
And so even if they had the
folks, who had the-- and I

2058
01:35:25,740 --> 01:35:28,510
agree with you--
that the expertise.

2059
01:35:28,510 --> 01:35:29,680
Even they had the expertise.

2060
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:32,055
They're just overwhelmed
because there's so much going on

2061
01:35:32,055 --> 01:35:35,040
in the traditional
certification marketplace

2062
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,710
that when you have all these
new entrants, it's hard to get.

2063
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:41,523
Basically, you join the
line and get a number.

2064
01:35:41,523 --> 01:35:42,940
And you would
probably say that we

2065
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:45,250
saw that when I was at Universal
Hydrogen. We were doing that.

2066
01:35:45,250 --> 01:35:47,125
It's just hard to get
a number because people

2067
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:50,000
are busy doing the Boeing and
Airbus things in the real world.

2068
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,770
But I do think that air
traffic controllers,

2069
01:35:52,770 --> 01:35:54,980
they have some staffing issues.

2070
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:59,300
The question is, is AI
going to be helpful,

2071
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:02,330
or do you have to search
staff to basically bring

2072
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:03,180
new technology in?

2073
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:05,290
And I leave that to you.

2074
01:36:05,290 --> 01:36:07,180
OK, I'll just make a
couple of quick comments

2075
01:36:07,180 --> 01:36:09,950
to start with the air traffic
control staffing issue.

2076
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:12,500
AI is not going to help
that particular problem.

2077
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,443
What will help that is
that the FAA is actively

2078
01:36:15,443 --> 01:36:17,860
changing the rules by which
people can get into the system

2079
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:19,110
and how the training is going.

2080
01:36:19,110 --> 01:36:21,370
And we pretty much
believe that that's

2081
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:23,630
going to start turning around.

2082
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:25,360
But it is a challenge right now.

2083
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,670
The existing controller
workforce in only a few places,

2084
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:30,970
but in a few very important
places is very overworked,

2085
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:33,770
and that is a constraint, to
some degree, on the system.

2086
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:37,360
But with respect to the
certification challenge,

2087
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,960
just kind of two
aspects to that.

2088
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,770
One is the way the
certification system

2089
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:46,990
works is that the applicants
are bringing with them not only

2090
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:49,750
this is what we want to certify,
but here's the means by which we

2091
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:51,290
are going to
demonstrate compliance.

2092
01:36:51,290 --> 01:36:54,040
And the FAA is sort of
honor bound in this system

2093
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:55,700
to not suggest how to do that.

2094
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:58,210
They can evaluate whether
something that comes

2095
01:36:58,210 --> 01:37:02,570
is adequate, but they're not
going to prescribe how to do it.

2096
01:37:02,570 --> 01:37:04,090
The challenge there
is nobody knows

2097
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:06,020
what's adequate for certain
kinds of systems like this.

2098
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:06,850
So we're actually holding--

2099
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:09,050
I think it might be next
week or a couple of weeks.

2100
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:10,510
We've been holding
these symposiums

2101
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:12,850
where the industry
comes and FAA comes

2102
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:15,620
and experts from other firms
come and discuss this problem.

2103
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:17,245
How are we going to
solve this problem?

2104
01:37:17,245 --> 01:37:18,740
So progress will be made.

2105
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:20,500
It will be made at
a pace which ensures

2106
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:23,170
safety, which is inconvenient
for venture capitalists

2107
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:24,220
and so forth.

2108
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:26,960
But that is what
everyone's trying.

2109
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:31,150
I mean, it is a
very big challenge.

2110
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:34,270
So you just have to
have to hold suit.

2111
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:38,803
You have to understand that
for the past 31 years at least,

2112
01:37:38,803 --> 01:37:40,720
and possibly an entire
Hansman, the only thing

2113
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:43,870
that the FAA has been asked
to certify essentially

2114
01:37:43,870 --> 01:37:46,810
looks like an airliner or
a general aviation aircraft

2115
01:37:46,810 --> 01:37:51,760
with slight variations
on where the engines go.

2116
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:54,730
We did certify the first
electric propulsion aircraft

2117
01:37:54,730 --> 01:37:56,710
about a year ago.

2118
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:59,780
Yeah, so that progress
has been made.

2119
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:02,260
But now we're going to bring
an aircraft with eight rotors

2120
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:05,830
and in some cases tilt rotor
and so on and so forth,

2121
01:38:05,830 --> 01:38:07,330
and then say that
that's going to be

2122
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:10,126
managed by an AI-based
system [INAUDIBLE].

2123
01:38:10,126 --> 01:38:20,350

2124
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:20,890
Wonderful.

2125
01:38:20,890 --> 01:38:22,490
Please, let's
thank our speakers.

2126
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:25,892
[APPLAUSE]

2127
01:38:25,892 --> 01:38:30,280

2128
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:33,280
And also Thank John for
all his contributions

2129
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,960
at the [INAUDIBLE].

2130
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,010
[APPLAUSE]

2131
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:41,000
