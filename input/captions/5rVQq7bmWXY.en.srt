that have changed this year that you

28
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,039
might not have seen in past years if

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,559
you've been kind of monitoring

30
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,359
application are thinking about this over

31
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,720
the last few years and then we'll be

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,080
doing Q&A I know a number of people

33
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,600
submitted q u their questions ahead of

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,840
time when they signed up and I did take

35
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,200
a look through that and hopefully I'll

36
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,159
answer many of those questions

37
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,400
throughout the PowerPoint and throughout

38
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,479
um the presentation and then also we

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,479
have the Q&A feature at the bottom of

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,680
your Zoom screen please go ahead and

41
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,200
utilize that and submit questions I do

42
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,400
hope again that many of them will be

43
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,920
answered throughout the presentation but

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,560
again our team is here to answer those

45
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,439
questions for you some of them will be

46
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,880
answered live towards the end of um the

47
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,680
session today and then some of them will

48
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,479
be answered in that Q&A chat um so

49
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,040
thanks to all of my teammates for

50
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,040
helping out with that

51
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,399
process all right the first thing I want

52
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,240
to start with is the mission of MIT

53
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,840
Sloan and the reason that it's really

54
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,240
important to start with this is because

55
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,280
I do think that you'll see that our

56
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,799
mission is built into every single thing

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,479
that we do at MIT Sloan um and

58
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,240
accomplishing this Mission starts with

59
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,039
the application right so the mission of

60
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,039
MIT Sloan principle of management is to

61
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,119
develop principled Innovative leaders

62
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,439
who improve the world and to generate

63
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,239
ideas that Advance management practice

64
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,560
and again the start of that is the

65
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,000
application we're looking for those Le

66
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,720
those Future Leaders who are going to

67
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,879
improve the world who are going to

68
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,480
generate those ideas and ultimately help

69
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,920
to advance management

70
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,480
practice so today our session is really

71
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,720
focused on the 2-year MBA but we do have

72
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,959
a number of Port of programs at MIT SLO

73
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,640
and this is an example of our portfolio

74
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,599
here so you can see that we have a

75
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,040
number of different specialized Master's

76
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,040
programs as well as MBA programs

77
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,519
depending on your years of experience um

78
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,080
so the MBA the 2-year MBA it's a

79
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,040
full-time program and on average folks

80
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,800
have about 3 to seven years of full-time

81
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,959
experience when they're going into the

82
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,519
program that means that people you know

83
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,840
finish up either their undergraduate or

84
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,239
any you know Master's programs that

85
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,560
they're doing they're working full-time

86
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,319
in Industry between on average again

87
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,560
it's on average about 5 years years but

88
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,400
the range is 3 to 7 and we definitely

89
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,519
have folks on the lower end of that as

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,360
well as folks on the higher end of that

91
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,280
then they take that kind of Hiatus to

92
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,720
come back join us for that two-year

93
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,280

opportunities that you might want to

107
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,560
look into a little bit more today's

108
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,120

109
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,680
the MBA application U but if there are

110
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,360
any kind of questions that pop up I

111
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,920
we'll try to answer those with regards

112
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,280

conclusion of this event and we'll be

115
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,840
happy to talk to you oneon-one

116
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,400
so I want to give a quick synopsis of

117
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,439
what does the MBA class look like at MIT

118
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,959
Sloan so first and foremost I just want

119
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:09,000
to point out that this is the class of

120
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,439
2025 so this is not the incoming class

121
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,079
this year the class that's coming in

122
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,879
this year is still being finalized and

123
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,000
those numbers should be available for

124
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:18,680
you on our website I would say by

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,400
mid-september or so so this is the class

126
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,080
that came in last end of last August

127
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,720
right in the class of 2025 and the class

128
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,960
size was around 409 it was 409 that

129
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,800
included both lgo and MBA um on average

130
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,639
again like I previously said the average

131
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,759
years of work experience was five we had

132
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,800
great Global representation with 60

133
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,360
countries represented I'm not going to

134
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,600
go through each of these here but I want

135
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,440
to kind of just showcase this class

136
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,720
profile so that you can see that there

137
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,440
is a place for every single person at

138
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,280
MIT Sloan and in the MBA program we have

139
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,400
people from all different backgrounds

140
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,919
all different undergraduate Majors all

141
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,520
different Industries prior to their MBA

142
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,960
and we encourage that iers of thought

143
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,080
within the classroom so we're looking

144
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,120
for people with different backgrounds to

145
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,600
join and and apply uh to our

146
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,000
program so a couple of reasons to pursue

147
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:18,280
an MIT Sloan MBA um really you know MIT

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,240
Sloan is uniquely situated as M as mit's

149
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,360
um business school and so we have a

150
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,680
really great intersection between that

151
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,240
business and technology throughout your

152
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,960
MBA program you will develop leadership

153
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,240
skills to really allow you to enhance

154
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,120
your career so many people coming into

155
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,840
an MBA are looking um either to get to

156
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,400
that next level within their career

157
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,600
within their industry or they're looking

158
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,479
to Pivot we have plenty of people that

159
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,919
come into Sloan um and think about you

160
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,759
know completely changing Industries and

161
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,919
that is welcomed at MIT Sloan um so if

162
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,400
you are looking to either grow within

163
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,199
your own your your organization or um

164
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,560
take a step in and leap in a different

165
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,440
direction the MBA is a really great way

166
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,960
and next step to do that also um

167
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,400
entrepreneurship is kind of built into

168
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,400
the ecosystem at MIT Sloan and so many

169
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,919
people choose to pursue an MBA in order

170
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,160
to pursue a startup idea I will say that

171
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:15,120
many um MBA students at MIT loan have

172
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,960
started an a a um have done a startup

173
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,599
prior to joining doing while they're at

174
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,840
loan or ultimately um are involved in

175
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,720
some way in in a startup later on in

176
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,599
their careers because of that kind of

177
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,000
entrepreneurial ecosystem we have an

178
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:31,080
incredible Network at MIT slan and

179
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,639
that's one reason why folks want to kind

180
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,160
of pursue an MBA in addition to kind of

181
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,280
enhancing their own skill sets um really

182
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,960
kind of building that network will allow

183
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,639
them to have something to tap into for

184
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,240
the rest of their career we also have a

185
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,400
number of offerings at MIT Sloan we are

186
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,360
an experiential learning um school we

187
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,759
have a one year or excuse me one

188
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,560
semester C uh one semester Core

189
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,520
Curriculum and then after that it's full

190
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,360
flexibility within um our curriculum to

191
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,120
take any classes that are interesting to

192
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,680
you

193
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,440
we have certificate opportunities um and

194
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,840
then also our action learning Labs um

195
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,560
which are an opportunity to work on real

196
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,599
world problems in different you know

197
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,560
Industries different Regional

198
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,560
opportunities and those are just some of

199
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,599
our academic offerings that people are

200
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,240
you know are attracted to MIT Salone for

201
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,879
those reasons today we are really

202
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,000
focusing in on the evaluation process as

203
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,120
well as the application process so I I'm

204
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,840
going to kind of pivot now and talk more

205
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,199
about that um so the MBA a evaluation

206
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,879
process just by some sheer numbers to

207
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,080
give you a sense of kind of where things

208
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:40,840
stand every year we get around 5,000

209
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,840
applications and that's across all three

210
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,720
rounds so we have three rounds in which

211
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,759
you can apply to the MBA program um this

212
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,479
one in SE the first one is in September

213
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,479
the second one is in January and the

214
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:55,199
third one is in April um and we get

215
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,360
around 5,000 applications every year for

216
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,120
across those three rounds all of the

217
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,520
applications are reviewed by the

218
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,840
admission committee and then from there

219
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,159
about 25% of of applicants are invited

220
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,639
to interview and from that about 16% are

221
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:13,919
actually admitted so 16% of the overall

222
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,240
5,000 application excuse me 16% of the

223
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,919
5,000 applications are actually admitted

224
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,840
to the program every

225
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:24,000
year so what are we evaluating when we

226
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,879
are when we get those applications so

227
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,319
after the deadline every single

228
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:29,919
application again is reviewed so you're

229
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,479
likely wondering if I submit my

230
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,399
application tomorrow is the admissions

231
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:35,800
committee looking at my application the

232
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,159
answer is no we do not start to look at

233
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,519
the applications until the day after the

234
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,680
deadline so there's not necessarily an

235
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,640
advantage to submitting it early you

236
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,800
just need to submit it by the deadline

237
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,839
date um so for this year you know the

238
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,920
deadline um for round one is sep uh

239
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:55,399
September 30th and so you will need to

240
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,560
submit it by 300 p.m. on that day and

241
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:58,920
then on October 1st bright and early the

242
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,560
admissions committee will get to work

243
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,959
and start reviewing those applications

244
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,480
uh so what are we looking for when we're

245
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,839
looking at the applications we're going

246
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,720
to go through all the components of the

247
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,800
application in just a minute but as

248
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,920
we're looking at the application overall

249
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,360
we're looking at the full application

250
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,519
not each component right so we are

251
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,000
looking for demonstrated success

252
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:19,760
throughout your application as well as

253
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,519
what we call leadership skills or

254
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,279
personal leadership attributes so a

255
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,399
couple examples of that is how well do

256
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,240
you work in a team how are you problem

257
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,320
solving how are you a how are you

258
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,760
communicating your thoughts and ideas

259
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,880
and how do you adapt to change we are

260
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,640
not necessarily looking for people that

261
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,920
have already had the opportunity to lead

262
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,880
right so we're looking for the ability

263
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,480
to like um we're looking for the ability

264
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,920
to want um to work in teams to

265
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,160
understand the perspectives that other

266
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,120
people bring to the table and so

267
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,680
throughout your application each of the

268
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,760
components you want to think how can I

269
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,120
showcase this how can I showcase the

270
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,440
successes that I've already had both you

271
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,600
know professionally and academically as

272
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,160
as well as you know my future successes

273
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,760
and so um within the application um we

274
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,040
are going to be looking at that and then

275
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,519
we're going to be kind of true MIT

276
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,120
fashion we're going to be plotting you

277
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,880
kind of on data right so we are not

278
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,480
evaluating each component to the

279
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,040
application but rather looking at the

280
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,279
entire application and looking for

281
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,040
certain competencies and those fall

282
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,959
within again demonstrated success so how

283
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,079
well did you do in your undergraduate

284
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,880
how well did you do on any test scores

285
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,040
that you're submitting how well did you

286
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,120
do in any m's programs how well did you

287
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,600
do um you know on on work place

288
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,839
evaluation so that letter of

289
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,240
recommendation hopefully it's coming

290
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,720
from someone in the professional setting

291
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,560
um and then on the the leadership

292
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,440
attributes that's looking again at you

293
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,680
know how well are you problem solving

294
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,399
how well are you working in teams and

295
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,440
from there we're plotting you kind of on

296
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,639
this chart and then we're looking at

297
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,680
those upper you know quadrant of folks

298
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,519
that are actually moving forward within

299
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,120
the process so if we think back to my

300
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,279
upside down triangle where I said about

301
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,639
25% of folks are invited to interview

302
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,040
they're all scoring mostly within this

303
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:13,040
upper um quadrant within this box this

304
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,720
is intended to just be um demonstrative

305
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,200
and I don't want anyone to kind of be

306
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,120
wondering what numbers and things of

307
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,079
that nature the idea is just that you're

308
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,720
putting together a complete uh picture

309
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,480
of your experiences within the written

310
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,399
application and so we're going to jump

311
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,040
into that now so here is the application

312
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,000
checklist um and this is all on our

313
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,839
website as well and again we we'll be

314
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
posting this recording as well um as the

315
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,399
you know you'll see be able to see the

316
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,560
slides throughout the recording but this

317
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,360
checklist and all of the components are

318
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,320
on the website under our how to apply

319
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,240
section so we have three rounds for MBA

320
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,399
September 30th is the most uh the one

321
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,800
that's coming up um and then we also

322
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,800
have our lgo dual degree program which

323
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,519
we mentioned earlier and there is only

324
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,600
one round for that and that's November

325
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,040
6th so if you are intending to apply to

326
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,200
lgo you must submit the lgo application

327
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,720
by that November 6th deadline um so here

328
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,279
are all of the different components on

329
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,320
the right hand side of the screen and

330
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,440
we're going to go through each one

331
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,240
individually and then we will talk a

332
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,120
little bit about interviews towards the

333
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,760
end which are require but they're By

334
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,120
Invitation Only um so your written

335
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,600
application is submitted reviewed by the

336
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,560
admissions committee the first you know

337
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,000
um round of reviews by the entire

338
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,880
committee come forward and about 25% of

339
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the pool is invited to interview and

340
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,560
you'll do a virtual interview if you are

341
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,320
invited to interview um if you are not

342
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,920
invited to interview you can get one of

343
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,800
two decisions uh you will get a reject

344
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,839
decision or you will get a wait list

345
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,839
without interview decision if you are

346
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,440
weight listed without an interview that

347
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,240
means that your application will be

348
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,600
reconsidered in round two at the time

349
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,000
that interview invitations are sent out

350
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,440
and then so on and so forth so if you

351
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,399
apply in round two in your weight listed

352
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,839
without an interview you'll be evaluated

353
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,160
in round three by round three you we do

354
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,880
not have a wait list without an

355
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,600
interview so everyone um you know will

356
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,440
will reviewed and ultimately either

357
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,199
invited to interview or a final decision

358
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,240
will be rendered at that

359
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:14,519
point so let's start with the cover

360
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,480
letter so the first thing on the cover

361
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:19,600
letter is we're asking you to seek a

successes that you've had we're looking

366
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,600
for specific examples here the cover

367
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,959
letter is intended to be 300 words or

368
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,160
fewer and we do ask that you stick to um

369
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:39,800
that length because you know we we want

370
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,079
you to be concise and we want you to

371
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,920
show us you know what are the what are

372
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,720
those examples of professional successes

373
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,560
that you want to highlight for the

374
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,440
admissions committee so um within the

375
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,440
cover letter you want to sell yourself

376
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,320
you want to make sure that you're

377
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,279
showing us what those successes are if

378
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,759
they're quantifiable that's great you

379
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,160
can absolutely include that if they're

380
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,040
not quantifiable tell us why is this

381
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,720
example important what does this mean to

382
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,160
you tell us why MIT Sloan why are we the

383
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,480
school that you're seeking to get your

384
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,480
MBA at and you know why are you a good

385
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,920
fit for our program um so again those

386
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,480
professional examples perhaps some

387
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,600
personal if they're relevant to

388
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,040
demonstrate why it's a good match um I

389
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,560
think one of the biggest pieces of

390
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,399
advice here is don't focus on future

391
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,759
goals your past performance is really

392
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:29,839
the in U an indicator of your future

393
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,240
success and so we're looking for those

394
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,240
past

395
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,160
examples the rume is the next component

396
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,639
um I'm going to go through the resume

397
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,279
then I'm going to kind of go back and

398
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,839
talk about the two together so the

399
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,839
resume is a one-page maximum so we're

400
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,560
looking for some specific um formatting

401
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,639
here that's recommended is Times New

402
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,880
Roman font size 10 um we're looking for

403
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,519
a word or PDF format and then again the

404
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,079
sections should be education work

405
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:58,040
experience and then any additional

406
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,560
information we're looking for something

407
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:03,399
that's easy to read so you know we don't

408
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,600
want you to go crazy with um any kind of

409
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,320
unique formatting here we really just

410
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,279
want simple bullets to be able to kind

411
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,880
of go through and understand what your

412
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,079
accomplishments have been you can

413
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,399
showcase any volunteer work that you may

414
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,240
have extracurriculars leadership

415
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,880
positions anything that you've earned

416
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,000
outside of the workplace or within the

417
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,399
workplace as well um it's also an

418
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,160
opportunity to tell us about some of

419
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,600
your personal interests I think that one

420
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,279
of the things that's really exciting

421
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,000
when when I get into an interview um I

422
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:33,720
love being able see what people's you

423
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,680
know uh hobbies are outside of um their

424
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,160
professional world so if you have the

425
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,240
space to do it definitely include a

426
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,759
little bit of information on on who you

427
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,680
are outside the workplace you know

428
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,639
whether you like skydiving or you know

429
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,600
eating cheese we've seen it all and I

430
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,000
would love um you know to learn a little

431
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,800
bit more about you from from that resume

432
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,639
so I want to pause here and go back to

433
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,519
both the cover letter and the resume and

434
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,720
often times one of the questions that I

435
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,600
get is well can I be duplicative I want

436
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,600
you to think of your application as a

437
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,360
whole thing that you're putting together

438
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,600
rather than these individual components

439
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,319
that we're going through so your resume

440
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,120
should showcase what like what your

441
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:13,240
accomplishments have been in the

442
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,000
professional setting we want to see

443
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,160
those quantifiable you know bullet

444
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,440
points um on the rume rather than your

445
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,279
daily tasks um underneath the different

446
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,040
jobs that you have held you may want to

447
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,399
pull some of those examples out and

448
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,399
showcase those and expand upon those in

449
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,079
the cover l letter but you're likely not

450
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,759
going to have room to expand upon all of

451
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,399
those examples right so you're picking

452
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,600
out the ones that are that mean the most

453
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,160
to you and talking about the more in the

454
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,040
cover letter putting more um color

455
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,560
around those examples and then perhaps

456
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,839
um that you know in the video which

457
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,560
we'll get to in a few minutes um you'll

458
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,680
be talking a little bit more about your

459
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,880
personal um experiences or your personal

460
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,240
um interests and what you want why why

461
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,399
you're pursuing an MBA right and so that

462
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,319
could be talked about a little bit more

463
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,160
in the cover or excuse me in the video

464
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:06,280
and so you want to use the real estate

465
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,319
within the application in a way that

466
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,240
allows you to expand on different things

467
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:14,319
um in different places you don't need to

468
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,559
say it all in all of the spots um so for

469
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,360
instance like again with the resume you

470
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,079
want to be putting those quantifiable

471
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,799
accomplishments into bullet points

472
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,079
within the resume and then maybe

473
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:25,880
expanding on two or three of those

474
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,520
examples within the cover letter to

475
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,080
really showcase why MIT Sloan and why

476
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,679
this is the right program for

477
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,120
you so talking about the video statement

478
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,799
I just mentioned it so again this is

479
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,760
that kind of third part and putting

480
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:42,760
together the complete picture of who you

481
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,720
are um and so the prompt for this is

482
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,919
introduce yourself to your future

483
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,080
classmates here's your chance to put a

484
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,240
face with a name let your personality

485
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,120
shine through and be conversational be

486
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,960
yourself we're excited to meet you um

487
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,200
the best piece of advice for the video

488
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:02,039
statement is keep it simple um you know

489
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,799
whatever is your comfort level is really

490
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,240
where you should be with the video and

491
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:08,120
so if that's sitting at your desk in

492
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,640
front of a webcam similar to what I'm

493
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,360
doing right now um absolutely do that if

494
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:17,200
that's um you know perhaps outside doing

495
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,679
something that's fine too the only thing

496
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,240
I would say is be mindful of your

497
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,880
surroundings um so oftentimes we have

498
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,360
seen videos that have incredible views

499
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,039
of incredible places on top of mountains

500
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,320
or um you know on hikes and while

501
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:34,679
they're incredible the wind is blowing

502
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,760
in the background and we can't hear what

503
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:39,159
the applicant is saying the most

504
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,240
important takeaway from the video is

505
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,280
what you're saying um so we really want

506
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,280
to be able to hear you clearly so play

507
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,320
the video back for yourself numerous

508
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,480
times to make sure that it's clear the

509
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,600
audio is good and there's no questions

510
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,200
there um you know we want to know a

511
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,799
little bit more about who you are things

512
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,440
that we don't see elsewhere in the

513
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,320
application this video will absolutely

514
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,559
not be shown to any of your future

515
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,000
classmates uh but it is going to be seen

516
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,400
by the admissions committee and we want

517
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,039
to know how are you going to be

518
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,280
introducing yourself to your future

519
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:10,120
classmates your future friends what are

520
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,039
you going to be um you know what what's

521
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,840
your elevator pitch to yourself when you

522
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:15,679
walk into the slone classroom for the

523
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,320
first time you know potentially in a

524
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,400
year so using your judgment think about

525
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,480
how you would answer that question um

526
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,000
and put put together the video statement

527
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,600
the video statement is 60 seconds so it

528
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,960
can be no more than one minute um and

529
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,840
it's there you know you can take do

530
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,960
multiple takes of it and and put and

531
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,880
upload that video but we don't want

532
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,640
editing meaning we don't want it pieced

533
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,159
together um absolutely no music in the

534
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,280
background so please don't put it to

535
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:44,200
music um please don't use Clos C you

536
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,919
know captions at the bottom we're

537
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,840
looking really just for you to be

538
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:52,559
speaking directly to the camera um and

539
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,559
and us being able to hear your

540
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:58,720
story all right the next part of the

541
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,559
application is video question two this

542
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,400
this is a new component for the 2024

543
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:08,480
2025 admission cycle so for entry um in

544
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:12,080
Fall 2025 you will need to submit video

545
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,320
question two as part of your application

546
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:19,000
um so video question two will pop up in

547
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:21,840
your application after about 80% of the

548
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,400
application is complete so it will be

549
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,640
automatically appear as a tab within the

550
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,159
application once that's once you've

551
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,320
completed enough of the application to

552
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:34,480
let it here there is a testing um you

553
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,360
know a testing window first so before

554
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,320
you start it you can kind of see what

555
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,760
what's going to happen and then you you

556
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,120
go through the process and it will it

557
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,200
will walk you through it it won't be

558
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,720
sudden um so it is a 60-second

559
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,679
open-ended randomly generated prompt

560
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,840
about your personal or professional

561
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:55,960
experiences because it is about your own

562
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,240
personal and professional experiences

563
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:00,200
there is no preparation needed and there

564
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,640
is no no right or wrong answer I think

565
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,760
that's the biggest takeaway from this um

566
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,559
there is absolutely no right or wrong

567
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,559
answer you will have 10 seconds to re

568
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:11,120
read the question that will appear which

569
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,320
again randomly generated so everyone's

570
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,880
going to get a different question and

571
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,360
you will have 60 seconds to record the

572
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,600
answer and then the it will turn off

573
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,720
after the 60 seconds um the admissions

574
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,720
committee will use this to assess your

575
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,440
competencies that we talked about before

576
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,400
as well as your communication skills so

577
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,640
again the question will pop up I can

578
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,559
give you know some examples I'll give a

579
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,039
couple examples you might not get these

580
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:38,520
questions um but tell us about a time

581
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:39,960
that you faced an ethical dilemma or

582
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,159
tell us about a time that you had to

583
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,880
work with a difficult teammate and so

584
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,760
you will see this question on the screen

585
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,279
and then you'll have 10 seconds and then

586
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,039
the the camera will turn on so before

587
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,000
that question appears you will again

588
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,480
have that testing phase to make sure

589
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,279
your camera is working your mic is

590
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,919
working everything is good to go um you

591
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:02,799
will see the video question to tab

592
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,279
appear on your application once about

593
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,480
80% or so of the application has been

594
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,360
completed um and then if you click on

595
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,039
the tab it it won't immediately start at

596
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,559
that time so you could go back to it so

597
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,679
if you see the tab appear it's okay um

598
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,960
to you know close out of your

599
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:18,520
application and say hey I'm going to do

600
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,279
video question two tomorrow um but again

601
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,960
all of these parts need to be completed

602
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:23,679
by the deadline date in order to be

603
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,400
considered for the round that you're

604
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,559
applying for so I'm I'm anticipating

605
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,960
there'll be a lot of questions about

606
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:31,679
this but I hope I answer answered as

607
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,120
many uh questions as

608
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,559
possible so the next part of the

609
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,520
application is the recommendation letter

610
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,760
MIT sles MBA program only requires one

611
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,520
letter of recommendation the question I

612
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,440
get most frequently is Can I submit

613
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,320
another letter of recommendation the

614
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,919
answer is no the the application asks

615
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,600
for one letter the admissions committee

616
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,440
wants to see one letter so we're looking

617
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,799
for you to use your best judgment on who

618
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,760
can write the best letter of

619
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,400
recommendation to Showcase your skill

620
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,840
set and your successes so on the right

621
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,880
hand side I have put together all of the

622
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,320
questions that we asked the recommender

623
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,760
and so you should read through these

624
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,320
questions and think who is best suited

625
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,880
to answer these questions for me um we

626
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,600
are looking for you know a more a mo

627
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,520
more recent example so to the extent

628
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,240
that you have told your employer that

629
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,960
you are applying to the MBA program um

630
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,279
and that you're looking to pursue an MBA

631
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,120
and they can respond to these questions

632
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,799
we would love it to see it from you know

633
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,559
your most recent supervisor of course we

634
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,679
also understand that a number of folks

635
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,440
do not tell their employers immediately

636
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,159
um perhaps in round one that they're

637
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,960
looking to leave you know the following

638
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:42,320
summer and so you might want to ask a a

639
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,120
previous supervisor or someone else that

640
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,880
you work with again this should be a

641
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,400
professional Source um a couple quick

642
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,159
things make sure that you ask your

643
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,120
recommender early giving them ample time

644
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,159
their recommendation letter needs to be

645
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,480
submitted Again by that deadline date so

646
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,640
for September or excuse me for round one

647
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,159
September 30th at 3: p.m. we need to

648
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,360
have their letter in order for your

649
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,480
application to be considered complete

650
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,159
you will get an email once they have

651
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,480
submitted their letter um but you will

652
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,000
not be receiving a copy of that letter

653
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,520
similarly we ask that you do not have

654
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,720
involvement with the writing of the

655
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,480
letter itself that really should be an

656
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,400
authentic letter that your recommender

657
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,480
is writing and uploading to our system

658
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,159
logistically in order to get the letter

659
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:28,399
of recommendation you need to go into

660
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,520
your application and input the

661
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:32,600
recommenders contact information into

662
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,480
the system that will prompt our system

663
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,640
to send them a link to send the letter

664
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,480
and that will automatically get attached

665
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,799
to your application once they submit it

666
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,520
um a couple quick things on to note on

667
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:46,840
the recommendation letter we do ask that

668
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,159
you use their um professional email

669
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:53,039
address so um you know avoiding personal

670
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,200
email addresses like Gmail or Yahoo or

671
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,640
anything of of that kind of nature

672
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,000
really using the organizations um even

673
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,720
if they're not at your current

674
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,399
organization anymore whatever their

675
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,039
professional email address is what we're

676
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:05,039
looking for

677
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,080
there we also ask for additional

678
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,919
references so we're just asking for two

679
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,200
additional names of professional

680
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,360
references um that can speak to your

681
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,120
abilities so this you can think of these

682
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,520
additional references as folks that you

683
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,840
would have asked for a letter of

684
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,600
recommendation from had there been the

685
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,480
opportunity to submit additional letters

686
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,520
of recommendation additional references

687
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,520
we could um contact at any point

688
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,360
throughout the admission cycle so we

689
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,360
might um we might have questions um

690
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,240
about your professional aptitude and

691
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,200
want to contact an additional reference

692
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,840
you know during the read phase or

693
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,279
potentially after an interview but

694
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,000
before a final decision uh we will never

695
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:48,200
reach out to an additional reference out

696
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,360
of the you know just out of the blue we

697
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,080
will always email them and try to set up

698
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,000
a mutually convenient time for a call if

699
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,919
they do not speak English we will pay

700
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,200
for the translator so you don't need to

701
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:02,360
worry about that um and again you know

702
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,799
we will be asking them very similar

703
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,440
questions uh to what you see on the

704
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,720
right hand side of the screen here that

705
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,840
we asked for the recommenders for within

706
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,840

707
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:18,039
letter okay the organizational chart the

708
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:22,279
organizational chart is intended to be a

709
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:23,919
visual depiction that you create um as

710
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:25,880

711
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,399
organization or within your department

712
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,000
depending on how how large your

713
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:31,919
organization is

714
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,080
so we want to understand who you're

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,600
go incredibly High maybe a couple levels

733
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,320
above you if you're able to do that

734
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,200
again for some folks that might be a lot

735
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,919
of people you have to use your best

736
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,760
judgment here to to kind of showcase um

737
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,320
what those interactions look like and

738
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,159
and who you report into we do ask that

739
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,279
you Circle yourself on the

740
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,720
organizational chart in Red so that we

741
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:36,360
are easily able to identify who you are

742
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,880
if any of your references or the folks

743
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,399
the person that writes your letter of

744
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,080
recommendation Falls within the

745
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:42,679
organizational chart we do ask that you

746
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,720
highlight them in some way so that we're

747
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:46,440
able to make that connection that hey

748
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,360
this is the person that wrote the letter

749
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,360
of

750
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,200
recommendation um the chart should match

751
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,880
your resume and your employment section

752
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,519
within the application I hopefully this

753
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,679
goes without saying but make sure that

754
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,760
you know when you're putting together

755
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:01,440
your organizational chart for your

756
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,200
primary job that's also the primary job

757
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,640
listed on your resume as well as your

758
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,440
primary job that you've listed in the

759
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,960
employment section on the

760
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,240
application um this last bullet point

761
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,840
here if it's possible to Showcase you

762
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,440
know your career growth within the

763
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:16,399
organization or within the department

764
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,360
you can absolutely do that um in this

765
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,360
space as well we've seen a number of

766
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,960
people use the organizational chart in

767
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,159
creative ways to Showcase their growth

768
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,120
um throughout their professional career

769
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:30,000
so that's completely up to you if you're

770
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,679
you are able to do that um again you

771
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,039
don't need to include names on the

772
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,640
organizational chart but you you know if

773
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:37,360
you are able to that's super helpful so

774
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,840
we can kind of match it up and also once

775
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,720
we get into an interview when you're

776
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,320
talking about specific examples it's

777
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,360
nice to for the interviewer to have that

778
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,600
up and be able to kind of see and

779
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,600
understand what who you're talking

780
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,240
about okay test scores so the test is a

781
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,880
required component to the MBA

782
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:02,640
application so we do accept the GMAT or

783
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:05,080
the GRE um for the MBA program the GMAT

784
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,559
we accept the focus Edition or the old

785
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,880
10th edition so if you have a 10th

786
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,720
edition score we're absolutely still

787
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,960
accepting that um and if you've taken

788
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,480
the focus exam that's fine too I know

789
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,919
that they're starting to call it just

790
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,919
GMAT um all of it so you will need to

791
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,640
differentiate when you submit your score

792
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:23,080
whether you took the focus or you took

793
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,000
the 10th edition um in the drop- down

794
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,640
menu or if you have a GRE score you can

795
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,840
submit that as well I did make a note

796
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,880
here starting this year there is the

797
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,000
GMAC business writing assessment score

798
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,120
um this is an optional test that

799
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,399
students are applicants are able to take

800
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,760
um and submit to show showcase their

801
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:45,200
writing abilities to um potential MBA

802
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,840
programs if you have this score and you

803
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,320
want to submit it there is an

804
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,919
opportunity for you to do that um on the

805
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,240
application it will just be considered

806
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,760
as an additional data point um I will

807
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,320
make a note that some applicants um may

808
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,880
be asked to take this later on in the

809
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,960
admissions process and you'll see this

810
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,480
noted in the application that we may ask

811
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,679
folks that have a GMAT Focus um score to

812
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,960
submit a GMAC business writing

813
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:13,799
assessment score at the interview fees

814
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,399
but we will contact you after interview

815
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:18,880
invites have gone out if we intend to

816
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,240
ask you to do this um so not nothing to

817
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,039
worry about right now but if you do want

818
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,279
to be proactive and go ahead and take

819
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:26,080
that you can submit that score um right

820
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:28,200
at the application fees and that is

821
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,880
available I believe starting in August

822
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:34,320
2024 so in a couple weeks um it should

823
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,720
be launched on the GMAC website so in

824
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,000
terms of what formats are acceptable for

825
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,360
GMAT and gr both the inperson and L

826
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,159
online are both acceptable we have no

827
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,559
preference um again for the GMAT it's

828
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:50,519
Focus or 10th edition in person or

829
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:52,120
online whichever you know you have or

830
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,960
whichever you did is totally fine with

831
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,159
us and there's no preference given there

832
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,880
test waivers so we get a lot of

833
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:01,639
questions are we having test waivers

834
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,799
this year are will you wave my test the

835
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:07,000
test waivers are granted on a limited

836
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:09,480
case by case basis only they are only

837
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,399
intended for those folks that are unable

838
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,559
to take a test because it is unavailable

839
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,720
in the place where they live within the

840
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,760
world we understand there are certain

841
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,639
places within the world that still are

842
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:24,639
not able to access the GMAT or the GRE

843
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:26,519
online or in person and for that reason

844
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:29,200
we will allow you to request a test

845
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,559
waiver the test waiver is not intended

846
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,559
to be a statement of academic Readiness

847
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:35,120
or that you have done additional things

848
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:37,960
within your career or within your

849
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,639
undergraduate or um what have you that

850
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,519
means that you don't need to take a test

851
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:44,039
that is not the intention of the test

852
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,159
waiver um so if you want to access the

853
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:48,519
test waiver you will go into the

854
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,320
application navigate to the test score

855
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:52,519
section of the application and there's

856
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,639
the W link to the waiver right in there

857
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:58,480
you can submit the waiver please give us

858
00:31:54,639 --> 00:32:00,799
around you know three to five days um

859
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,279
time to respond to your request if the

860
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,360
admissions committee says um yes you can

861
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,679
have a test waver you'll get an email uh

862
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,840
and then you'll be able to submit your

863
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:10,799
application without the um without the

864
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,600
test if the admissions committee says no

865
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,320
you must submit a test you will not be

866
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,600
able to submit the application without a

867
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,519
test score and you will need to take

868
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,399
either the Gman or the GRE in order to

869
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:22,639
move forward with the application um so

870
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:24,679
I hope that answers all the questions

871
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:27,600
but test

872
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,679
scores all right academic records and

873
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,919
Rel coursework you will need to submit

874
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,679
your transcript as part of your

875
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,559
application to MIT Sloan um you need to

876
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:38,480
submit transcripts from all schools that

877
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,519
you've attended or that you're currently

878
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,039
attending um if you transferred you need

879
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,080
you need to submit the transcripts from

880
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,720
those transfer institutions as well it

881
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:49,720
is not enough that the transfer credits

882
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,440
appear on your final transcript um

883
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,600
within the transcripts we're looking for

884
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,720
academic aptitude we're looking for your

885
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,200
comfort level with quantitative work um

886
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,519
and we're looking for a sense of

887
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,760
intellectual curiosity so this you know

888
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:04,360
this kind of area is often where I get

889
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,399
so do I need to have a stem background

890
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:09,279
or do I need to you know have a Quant

891
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:11,480
background in order to come to MIT Sloan

892
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:13,440
the answer is no um so you'll see that

893
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,399
there is a page within the application

894
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,120
that's asking you um a number of

895
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:18,399
relevant courses and if you've taken any

896
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,799
of those not all of them are

897
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,200
quantitative but some of them are um

898
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,240
there are plenty of people that have

899
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,120
been admitted to our MBA program that

900
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,240
that page is completely blank for them

901
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,760
so if that's the case for you do not

902
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,760
panic that is really intended for us to

903
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,639
understand within the admissions

904
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,440
committee decision meetings you know

905
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:38,440
does this person maybe need a little bit

906
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,080
of extra preparation to make sure that

907
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,399
they're set up for Success within the

908
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,600
classroom space our goal on the

909
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,600
admissions team and um you know on the

910
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,799
committee is really to set you up for

911
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,200
success and so we would never want you

912
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,960
to you know come into a program that you

913
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,679
aren't prepared for so if you don't have

914
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,120
some of the background classes that we

915
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,360
think that might be helpful we may give

916
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,919
you a preparatory class um in order to

917
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,519
matriculate if we if we were to give you

918
00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:07,120
admission um in the future so that's

919
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,839
just one kind of note there when you're

920
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,879
listing out relevant cours work that you

921
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:13,919
have taken

922
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,879
already all right short answer question

923
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,119
we this was previously an optional

924
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:19,919
question it is now mandatory for all

925
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:23,440
applicants to submit the answer to this

926
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,800
question it's 250 word um text box

927
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,800
within the actual application itself and

928
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,879
we're asking you how has the world you

929
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,159
come from shaped who you are today for

930
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:33,599
example your family culture Community

931
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,760
all help to shape aspects of your

932
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,240
identity please share more about your

933
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,599
background this is an opportunity for us

934
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,919
to learn more about you expanding on

935
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:45,159
your background where you come from um

936
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:47,839
we are limiting it only to words so no

937
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:49,960
external videos or links will be

938
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:51,839
reviewed as part of this but we really

939
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,440
want to know a little bit more about you

940
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,760
so again when you're thinking about kind

941
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,800
of all those different components

942
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,400
putting together you know um the color

943
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,160
the colorful picture of who you are as

944
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,320
an applicant hopefully this sheds a

945
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,440
little bit more light on who you are on

946
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,800
the personal

947
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,400
side all right so we went through all

948
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,839
the components of the application again

949
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,040
all of those components are going to be

950
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,599
reviewed by the admissions committee

951
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,400
then we're going to sit down and have

952
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:21,160
that holistic review of the application

953
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,440
we're not grading the components we're

954
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,960
looking for competencies within the

955
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,440
entire application what Have you shared

956
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,760
with us for example examples what has

957
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,320
your recommender said um you know what

958
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,320
have you said within your video once we

959
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,119
look at all those competencies we'll be

960
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,960
scoring on those demonstrated successes

961
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,160
as well as those personal attributes and

962
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,680
Leadership skills plotting it on

963
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,599
plotting all of the applicants on the

964
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,040
graph and inviting those that fall

965
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:49,960
within that upward quadrant to interview

966
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,640
which will end up being about 25% of the

967
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,440
pool if you're invited for an interview

968
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,800
you will get an email inviting you to

969
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,839
interview in in information about

970
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,720
responding to additional short answer

971
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:02,960
questions that you will have to do no

972
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,240
later than by 24 hours before your

973
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,920
scheduled interview you'll schedule a

974
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,560
virtual 30 minute interview with the

975
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,359
member of the admissions committee and

976
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,640
then within that um 30 minutes you'll be

977
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,960
doing behavioral based questions

978
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,560
answering behavioral based questions

979
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,040
about your professional

980
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,119
experiences um so again we be looking

981
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,480
for specific examples on how you felt

982
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,880
about something how you handled

983
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,599
something um who else was involved so

984
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,319
talking about some of your professional

985
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:30,640
experiences and maybe thinking about um

986
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:33,119
different examples that you'd want to

987
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,119
showcase with in an interview your

988
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,680
written application is intended to give

989
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,640
us a taste of what is to come right so

990
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,040
like we we've read your written

991
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,920
application we've seen all these

992
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,040
successes that you've showcased within

993
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,160
that written application and now within

994
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,560
the interview we want to hear more that

995
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,000
we're inviting you to tell us more and

996
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,920
you'll want to think about what kind of

997
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:59,760
examples you might want to include in

998
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:02,040

999
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,720

00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:08,119

1003
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:13,599

1004
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,079
um will help you when you're thinking

1005
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,079
about putting together your

1006
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:19,240
application apply early and follow the

1007
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,839
instructions I'm going to say both of

1008
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,880
these kind of together um applying early

1009
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,400
you know is a balancing act you want to

1010
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,760
apply when the time is right for you so

1011
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,359
don't do it if you're feeling feeling

1012
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,640
rushed um hopefully many of you that are

1013
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:34,800
logged in today feel as though you know

1014
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,000
you're you're ready for round one you

1015
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,040
still have a couple months um of time to

1016
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,240
get everything put together but asking

1017
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,839
your recommender now getting all of

1018
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,520
those kinds of last minute things

1019
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:46,400
buttoned up and starting to put those

1020
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,119
final touches on your application over

1021
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,440
the next two months to be ready to

1022
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:53,359
submit in September but let's say

1023
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,119
something in life happens as life does

1024
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,319
and it prevents you from hitting the

1025
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,040
submit button on September 30th does

1026
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:00,319
that mean that you shouldn't apply this

1027
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,680
year because you're going to apply in

1028
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:06,160
round two absolutely not go ahead and

1029
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,640
apply in round two and similarly if you

1030
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,160
um you know aren't able to apply in

1031
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:11,040
round two you can apply in round three

1032
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,240
we have three rounds we admit people in

1033
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,280
three rounds every year uh but the

1034
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,200
reality is is that in round one the

1035
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,760
whole class every seat is available

1036
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,720
right and so as we admit folks it

1037
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,760
throughout each round we've we have

1038
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,839
seats that are taken up it's just basic

1039
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,040
math um so that's why we encourage you

1040
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:31,599
to apply early if you're ready you don't

1041
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:33,440
want to wait till to the last round if

1042
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,440
you have an application that's ready to

1043
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,520
to be submitted um and follow the

1044
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,480
instructions we have been so thoughtful

1045
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,599
and put a lot of effort into kind of

1046
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,400
going through the application and making

1047
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:46,680
sure that all the instructions are

1048
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,440
clearly articulated so please follow

in the

1080
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:05,560
background hey Alexis hi thanks for

1081
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,359

out there and so thank you for everybody

1083
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,119
we got a few minutes left to answer them

1084
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,119
and we're not going to answer all of

1085
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,040
them so just to reiterate please email

1086
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:17,359
us we will get to your questions um so

1087
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,319
one of the big ones is where should

1088
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:22,560
applicants talk about why they're

1089
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:25,160
choosing MIT slan yeah good question in

1090
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,359
the cover letter so the 300w cover

1091
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:31,040
letter is intended for us to understand

1092
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:33,160
why MIT Sloan is a good fit for you and

1093
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,599
why you are a good fit for MIT Sloan so

1094
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,200
it's kind of a two-way street there so

1095
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,240
we're looking for you to show us you

1096
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,839
know what about MIT Sloan kind of fits

1097
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,160
you know with who you are as well as why

1098
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,800
um you know you're a good fit like what

1099
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:48,599
what what are your characteristics that

1100
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,319
fit with who we are looking

1101
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,920
for um okay uh let's see another one

1102
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:54,440
that we have

1103
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,760
is

1104
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:01,319
um what can people expect in the video

1105
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,280
questions in terms of of you know the

1106
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:04,720
the preparation especially video

1107
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,680
question too since it is new to the

1108
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,640
application terms of the preparation the

1109
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,960
type of question that is yep so video

1110
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:14,280
question two again absolutely no

1111
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,200
Advanced preparation is needed is about

1112
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,599
your the questions are all about your

1113
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,680
per your own personal and professional

1114
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:23,640
experiences so a question an open ended

1115
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,880
randomly generated question will pop up

1116
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:29,000
on the screen and you'll have 10 seconds

1117
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:30,760
to review it and think of response um

1118
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,839
I've done it a few times now you know

1119
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,000
personally testing it out and thinking

1120
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:37,160
of examples from my own personal

1121
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,960
professional experiences and it is

1122
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,960
totally doable um and the idea is that

1123
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,839
we're just learning to learn a looking

1124
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:47,480
to learn a little bit more about you um

1125
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:49,480
and on that kind of you know um popup

1126
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,280
question versus something like the video

1127
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,680
question one where you have you know all

1128
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,640
the Time in the World to kind of prepare

1129
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:56,800
for it and put forth what your your

1130
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,440
presentation would be um I would say

1131
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,680
don't start stress about it too much

1132
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,480
again there is a test window so like

1133
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,680
none of the logistics behind it will be

1134
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,880
a surprise you'll be able to do the test

1135
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,760
before you jump into the actual

1136
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,599
question awesome um and then also here's

1137
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,200
a really great question what are some

1138
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,240
common mistakes that should be avoided

1139
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,240
when completing the

1140
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,359
application not following the

1141
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,960
instructions I would say is the number

1142
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:26,040
one um we have again been really

1143
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,079
thoughtful about putting those together

1144
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:30,599
so again we ask for one letter of

1145
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,640
recommendation submit one letter of

1146
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:35,440
recommendation um we ask for the cover

1147
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,319
letter to be 300 Pages excuse me not 300

1148
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,440
pages that is definitely I'm definitely

1149
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:42,280
misspeaking there 300 words um not

1150
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,359
including the you know introduction or

1151
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:47,839
salutation limit it to 300 words the

1152
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,760
resume is a one-page resume you know

1153
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:52,119
don't go submitting a 10-page CV with

1154
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,599
you know every single thing that you've

1155
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:57,720
done since you know Elementary School we

1156
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,920
are looking for you to be um efficient

1157
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,440
and effective within your

1158
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,880
application so we got a as always we get

1159
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:08,800
a lot of questions about the or chart um

1160
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:11,440
so should appli so should applicants

1161
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,760
pick which organization that they work

1162
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,079
for for their orig chart or should they

1163
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:19,079
use their most relevant most recent uh

1164
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,760
job good question all right so the or

1165
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:23,800
chart is intended to be your current

1166
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,040
role your most recent goal so I'm

1167
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,760
goingon to talk about a couple question

1168
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,319
common questions we get

1169
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,280
Consultants that will be the first one

1170
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:33,599
that will come up um if you are a

1171
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,680
consultant you can do your most recent

1172
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,599
project that you worked on rather than

1173
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,280
the firm that you work for so I'll just

1174
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,960
use McKenzie as an example if you work

1175
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,720
for McKenzie I don't need to see where

1176
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,200
you fall within McKenzie I want to see

1177
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,880
kind of where you fall or who you were

1178
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,559
working with on your most re recent

1179
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,559
client project another common one that

1180
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:53,480
we get is military folks should they

1181
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:55,599
include their military or chart um or

1182
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,800
should they include you know if they if

1183
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,359
they held a civilian role or if they've

1184
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,800
held like another previous role um you

1185
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:04,760
can do both your civilian role and your

1186
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,400
you know on if your active duty your

1187
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,520
active duty um org chart as well again

1188
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,359
going back to what I was saying about

1189
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,079
the confidential information I'm not

1190
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,119
looking for confidential information

1191
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,800
within this so just giving us kind of a

1192
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,880
general picture of of where you fall and

1193
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,079
and who the folks are that you're

1194
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,319
working with or reporting to is really

1195
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,599
helpful um a lot of people will say hey

1196
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:28,599
I just started a job um like a month ago

1197
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,440
so I'm not really sure like the or chart

1198
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,800
is going to Showcase that much about

1199
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,520
where what I'm doing we are still

1200
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,119
looking for it to be your current role

1201
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,960
so even if you just started the job uh

1202
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:39,960
when you submit the application please

1203
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,160
go ahead and make sure that it's your

1204
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,400
application reflects that and has the or

1205
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,720
chart from your new role uh and then we

1206
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,400
can talk about it more if you get to

1207
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,800
that interview phase like to understand

1208
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,720
a little bit more about the details

1209
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,599
you'll hopefully have more information a

1210
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,319
few months later about what your your

1211
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:56,760
new role looks

1212
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:59,319
like and I guess I'll sort of uh one

1213
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,839
last question keeping an eye on time um

1214
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:03,640
so this is more about sort of the test

1215
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:06,880
scores should people take multiple tests

1216
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,760
and and submit them yes um so if you

1217
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,200
have multiple test scores absolutely go

1218
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,280
ahead um and submit all of those scores

1219
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,359
we will look um at all of the scores

1220
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,480
that are submitted one thing that we do

1221
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,680
we do ask that you do not do is make

1222
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,240
like a super score so don't just take

1223
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,040
your highest Quant and your highest

1224
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,960
verbal and tell us those two things you

1225
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,040
need to tell us the full real score from

1226
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,599
all of the um tests that you took so

1227
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,920
that way when we if you are admitted and

1228
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,520
you ultimately come we verify all of

1229
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,200
these things so we need to have an

1230
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:38,559
accurate accounting of what your GMAT or

1231
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,359
GRE test scores were um so if you have

1232
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:41,960
multiple absolutely go ahead and submit

1233
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:45,040
them it's totally up to

1234
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,280
you you have time for one more yeah oh

1235
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,839
yeah we could take a couple more all

1236
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,359
right cool so here's a really good

1237
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:53,200
question how does MIT slan evaluate

1238
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:55,400
full-time work experience uh do we just

1239
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,079
look at 40-hour weekly commitments or is

1240
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:01,480
it more specific titles roles

1241
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:04,040
positions oh great question um so

1242
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,000
full-time work experiences I mean you

1243
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:08,319
know plenty of people are working more

1244
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,119
than 40 hours in a work week um and

1245
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:12,079
plenty of people are holding more than

1246
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:13,920
you know one role right now I know there

1247
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,599
are plenty of applicants that are

1248
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,760
holding a role within an organization

1249
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,240
and then potentially pursuing um a

1250
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,800
startup on the side so we can definitely

1251
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,200
look at both those we do ask you to

1252
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,480
qualify one organization as your primary

1253
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,640
employer on the application

1254
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,480
um and so that would be kind of

1255
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,400
self-identified by you is to what that

1256
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,920
full-time experience looks like

1257
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,839
internships are not considered a

1258
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,960
full-time experience so we are looking

1259
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:42,880
for for your employed full-time um but I

1260
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,680
would say on average folks are working

1261
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,119
40 40 or more hours per week um in a

1262
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,400
full-time

1263
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:52,319
role great thank you and sort of keeping

1264
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,839
in that evaluation strain of questions

1265
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,920
uh how do we evaluate leadership

1266
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:57,800
potential in

1267
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:00,119
applicants yeah great question um again

1268
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,160
so we're looking you know for leadership

1269
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:05,040
potential but not necessarily having

1270
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,800
leadership um experience already right

1271
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,040
so the MBA a lot of the MBA is getting

1272
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,319
leadership skills and understanding how

1273
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,760
to become a leader within your

1274
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:15,440
organization within your industry um or

1275
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,440
again pivot and become a leader and so

1276
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,800
we are looking for folks that are

1277
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,839
open-minded that are excited about

1278
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,800
working with others and that you know

1279
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:27,079
have had that experience in the past of

1280
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,200
working on teams that have had the

1281
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:31,880
experience of problem solving and we're

1282
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,680
looking at all of those kind of together

1283
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,440
with um what your recommender has said

1284
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,359
about you how how are you as a people

1285
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,040
person how are you you know thinking

1286
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:41,880
about problems that have you know you've

1287
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,800
had a long time to think about or

1288
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,200
problems that have just AR resen and and

1289
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,559
you you had to react on your feed all of

1290
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,599
those kinds of indications or indicators

1291
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,599
within the application are giving us the

1292
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:54,400
the the information that we need to

1293
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:57,880
assess the competencies in particular

1294
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:00,240
what your future leadership potential

1295
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,119
awesome um and then a question sort of

1296
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,480
about the recommender we've got a lot of

1297
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:06,599
questions about the recommender and one

1298
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:08,319
of the more interesting ones is uh is it

1299
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:11,800
a plus if the recommender is a member of

1300
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,760
the MIT Sloan Community um or does it

1301
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:15,119
make a

1302
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,559
difference it does not make a difference

1303
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,160
if that person does not know you in the

1304
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:21,400
professional setting and really can

1305
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,839
speak to all of those qualities if your

1306
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,400
direct supervisor can talk about all of

1307
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,440
those questions I had listed out that

1308
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,400
are you know within the application um

1309
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,680
and and they're an MIT SL Alum fantastic

1310
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,960
that seems like easy but you are not

1311
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,520
getting extra points by having a letter

1312
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,440
recommendation written by someone within

1313
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,839
the Sloan Community U so again if it if

1314
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,160
it happens to work out for you in that

1315
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,480
way that's great absolutely go ahead but

1316
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,119
that you are not getting anything extra

1317
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,760
by having a recommendation from someone

1318
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:52,880
within the SL Community we are looking

1319
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,920
for thoughtful detailed letters of

1320
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,960
recommendation so whomever that means

1321
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,960
for you is who should write your of

1322
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,319
recommendation and I think that same

1323
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,599
thing that same answer goes to title

1324
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:04,839
right I'm not necessarily looking for

1325
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,400
someone to write your letter of

1326
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:08,680
recommendation that's at the top of an

1327
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,920
org and that has met you one time in the

1328
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:14,880
cafeteria or on an elevator I am looking

1329
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,680
for your direct supervisor who really

1330
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,440
understands your work and your your

1331
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,280
successes day in and day out those

1332
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,119
letters of recommendation are so much

1333
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,720
more thoughtful provide so much more

1334
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:28,920
insight and really quite frankly are way

1335
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,920
more helpful to your application than uh

1336
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,880
you know a highle executive that really

1337
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,880
can't speak to your

1338
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,880
abilities okay uh let's see uh question

1339
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,040
about sort of the testing again

1340
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:43,079
especially the addition of the of the

1341
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:46,720
GMAC business writing requirement like

1342
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:48,920
aspect if someone took a gr do you think

1343
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,400
it's Bene beneficial for them to take

1344
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,680
the GMAC in the name of being proactive

1345
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,200
the writing ass the writing assessment

1346
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,119
or I am just telling people that it's an

1347
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,280
opportunity to submit the score but

1348
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:02,000
we're not encouraging it in any way if

1349
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,400
if you want to submit it you absolutely

1350
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,559
are welcome to um it's just another data

1351
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,200
point so there's absolutely no negative

1352
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,079
inferences if you do not submit it um

1353
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,359
and if for those that do submit it it's

1354
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:15,880
just an additional data point um we

1355
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:18,680
again we may ask folks that took the G

1356
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:21,880
Focus Edition that are being invited to

1357
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:24,640
interview we may contact them um but

1358
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:27,400
that will be decided later on within the

1359
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:29,040
admissions process

1360
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,599
um and then a question sort of about the

1361
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,480
transcript especially from students who

1362
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,319
went through undergraduate or graduate

1363
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,200
programs during covid and their

1364
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:41,559
institutions moveed to sort of a past

1365
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:43,240
fail how do we um evaluate that and how

1366
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:46,640
how do they sort of want to report their

1367
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:48,160
GPA there yeah absolutely so your GPA

1368
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,720
were really clear on the application

1369
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:54,599
should be reported exactly as it says it

1370
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,079
on the transcript um so you know read

1371
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:57,599
the instructions of the application and

1372
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,040
do exactly what it says we're not

1373
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:02,200
looking for you to recalculate your GPA

1374
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,839
the only person we're asking for a

1375
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:07,880
calculated GPA is for someone that does

1376
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:09,599
not have GPA on their transcript if your

1377
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,000
if your school is giving that GPA on the

1378
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,200
transcript regardless of what it's out

1379
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,040
of you will put it exactly as it says on

1380
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,359
the application um and so for folks that

1381
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,160
do have those path fails we of course

1382
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:23,200
have become very familiar with seeing

1383
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:25,960
those over the last four super common

1384
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:29,280
almost every applicant has um a pass

1385
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,000
fail or multiple given the covid years

1386
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,599
um so I wouldn't put too much stress on

1387
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,720
that you know we we're looking to kind

1388
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:38,240
of see you know what your overall um

1389
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,559
performance was in your undergrad but

1390
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,880
I'm not putting too much stress on a

1391
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:43,280
past

1392
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,839
fail um and here's a really interesting

1393
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:47,839
one I haven't seen before about the

1394
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:50,680
about the resume itself how does a good

1395
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:52,599
MBA resume different from say a resume

1396
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:56,319
you would use to apply for a

1397
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:57,040
job oh that's a great question um so I

1398
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,839
think

1399
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,040
sometimes they're a little bit similar

1400
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:03,160
in the sense that you're trying to

1401
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,920
Showcase your skill set for a particular

1402
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:08,440
role right and so for us we're really

1403
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,240
looking for impact bullets impact

1404
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,520
related bullets impact results um so

1405
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:15,480
what have your successes again been

1406
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,760
within your roles whether it's your

1407
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,440
current role or your past roles within

1408
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,839
the same organization or a different

1409
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,119
organization um you are not necessarily

1410
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:26,079
outlining what you're responsible for on

1411
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:29,440
like a daily basis where that you might

1412
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:31,240
be doing that for um for a job you are

1413
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,200
really showcasing what the successes

1414
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,680
have been if they're quantifiable

1415
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,280
putting in those successes um depending

1416
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,720
on what the job is you might not that

1417
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,880
You' be applying for in the future you

1418
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,160
might not have all of those details that

1419
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,400
level of detail um but you'd be having

1420
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,319
more about like what you actually

1421
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,880
responsible for we're not looking for

1422
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:50,200
like a list of your responsibilities or

1423
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,880
um we're looking more on the

1424
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,559
accomplishment

1425
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,400
side awesome and then sort of uh there

1426
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:59,599
are a few people who are reapplicants

1427
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,319
who've asked questions um any general

1428
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,839
advice for reapplicants yeah great great

1429
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:06,000
I'm glad that you're here thank you so

1430
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:07,200
much for logging in um the application

1431
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,920
will look slightly different with the

1432
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,839
new components that you haven't seen in

1433
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:13,359
the past but you are uniquely um you're

1434
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,359
in a unique position right as a

1435
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:17,160
reapplicant the admissions committee

1436
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:18,839
will look at your past application as

1437
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,119
well as your current application so my

1438
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:23,160
biggest piece of advice is use this to

1439
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:25,559
your advantage you essentially get

1440
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:27,920
double real estate right so you had your

1441
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:30,599
application last year do not submit the

1442
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,200
same components redo almost everything

1443
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:33,880
get a different letter of recommendation

1444
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,079
even if it's from the same person have

1445
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:38,720
them updated with new examples that have

1446
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,280
happened you know in the last year um

1447
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,480
you don't want to use all of those same

1448
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,079
components as last year because

1449
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,200
obviously that didn't work last year so

1450
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:45,880
we want to make sure that we're

1451
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,240
showcasing more of those successes

1452
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,160
giving us more data that we can pull

1453
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:53,559
those competencies from to move you on

1454
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:55,440
within the process um so I would say you

1455
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:58,160
know just be mindful review your

1456
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:01,319
application from last year um and update

1457
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:01,319
all the components that you

1458
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:08,599
can let's see um Can people send

1459
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:11,160
additional uh letters of

1460
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:13,079
recommendation so the application is one

1461
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,000
of the instructions and one of my

1462
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:17,000
biggest piece of pieces of advice is

1463
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,880
follow the instructions the application

1464
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,119
asks for one letter of

1465
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:24,160
recommendation um so please do not

1466
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,520
submit more than one letter of

1467
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,960
recommendation um and then someone asked

1468
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,599
a question so uh why do we ask for

1469
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,880
salary

1470
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:34,559
information so salary information is

1471
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,280
really intended to kind of see your

1472
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,200
potential growth um sometimes it

1473
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,880
showcases that it does not always show

1474
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,559
showcase that and I will be completely

1475
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,880
clear that it is very different across

1476
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,760
Industries so we're asking salary

1477
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,480
information but we're not putting

1478
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,720
significant weight on it nor are we um

1479
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,119
you know showcasing that in any way as

1480
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:56,040
part of our evaluation of your

1481
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:58,240
application so we're looking to see like

1482
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:00,040
if you started within an organization

1483
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,400
and you've had significant salary growth

1484
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:05,280
let's say over six months that potential

1485
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,480
potentially is an indicator of success

1486
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,000
potentially there's a lot more to it so

1487
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,400
like that will kind of spark like oh

1488
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,799
that's interesting and then go into

1489
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,920
going into the letter of recommendation

1490
00:55:11,799 --> 00:55:17,000
to learn a little bit

1491
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,400
more awesome um and then sort of uh

1492
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:23,520
let's see oh very interesting question

1493
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:24,240
the GPA um should if your GPA is not in

1494
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,280
a

1495
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:33,160
4.0 4.0 scale is it okay to use a

1496
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:36,079
service like W uh Wes to convert your

1497
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,599
GPA please do not convert your GPA it

1498
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,640
says with in the application when you go

1499
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:43,319
to apply do not convert your GPA we are

1500
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,720
so familiar with a number of different

1501
00:55:43,319 --> 00:55:48,400
scales throughout the world and we ask

1502
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,960
that you do not you know change that GPA

1503
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,079
in any way so put it in exactly as it

1504
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,400
appears on your transcript the only one

1505
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:57,440
the only applicants that should be

1506
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:00,039
calculating a GPA are the folks that um

1507
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,240
actually don't have a GPA on their on

1508
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:04,799
their transcript itself some people do

1509
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:07,079
not have a GPA and therefore we give

1510
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:09,960
instructions on you know calculating one

1511
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:11,920
if you have a GPA out of any scale do

1512
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,839
not recalculate it you just put it into

1513
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,000
the application exactly as it appears on

1514
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,000
your

1515
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:21,720
transcript and sort of does having only

1516
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:23,079
two years of experience reduce one's

1517
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,319
chances at

1518
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:27,680
admission so it doesn't off the bat

1519
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:30,200
reduce your chances we are looking for

1520
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:32,920
again those examples of um work

1521
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,119
successes we really do believe that the

1522
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:37,480
more work experience that you have that

1523
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,960
average of five years um the better

1524
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,720
prepared you will be for the MBA

1525
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,960
classroom the you'll come with better

1526
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,720
you know more robust examples um you'll

1527
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,640
be able to be a more active contributor

1528
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,440
within the classroom that being said we

1529
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:52,160
do have people coming in with two years

1530
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,200
of full-time work experience and so um

1531
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,799
you I I don't want to give a blinket

1532
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,160
answer to this it really depends on the

1533
00:56:55,799 --> 00:56:59,599
applicant you really need to kind of

1534
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:01,319
look at your work experiences um in

1535
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:04,079
particular if you're thinking about

1536
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:06,760
applying um in round one at this point

1537
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:08,799
you only worked for one year so you only

1538
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,280
are pulling from one year's worth of

1539
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:14,359
work experience um to Showcase within

1540
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:16,480
that application so it ends up being um

1541
00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:17,839
a much shorter time frame than many

1542
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,200
other applicants so it really just

1543
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:23,200
depends on what your own experiences um

1544
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,200
are
