1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,920
hello everybody can people hear me in

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,560
the back is it working cool okay so um I

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,800
believe that uh last time we started uh

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,320
counting and you saw the uh the sumr in

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,359
particular um so let's uh let's take a

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,840
look at a quick example so I've got a a

7
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,600
very standard deck of playing cards here

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,440
as you can see uh how many kings and

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,239
queens are

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,239
there eight why is

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,559
that yeah so the the the answer was that

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,559
there are four suits uh for for each

13
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,879
rank we've got therefore Four Kings Four

14
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,359
Queens nothing is both a king and a

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,680
queen so you can kind of just add them

16
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,640
together right you've got eight cards

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,079
that are either Kings or Queens okay uh

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,960
what if the sets are not disjoint so

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,000
what if I instead wanted to count the

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,519
number of cards that are either hearts

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,519
or face

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,119
cards so that then what do I

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,680
do so I've got uh you know 12 face cards

24
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:17,560
here my my hands are a little bit too

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,200
small for playing cards but you know

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,880
hopefully you can roughly see right how

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,880
many hearts are

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,479
there yeah 13 Hearts so 13 hearts in one

29
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,159
hand

30
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,159
12 face cards in the other so uh

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,560
25 no what's gone

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,439
wrong can anybody tell me what's gone

33
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,439
wrong

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,560
yeah yeah I've got two kings of Hearts

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,719
here so I'm I'm cheating uh okay so what

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,719
what do

37
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,920
yeah exactly so the answer was you know

38
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,599
I've got three cards that are both

39
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,120
hearts and face cards right so these are

40
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:14,400
the three cards that I've counted twice

41
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,200
right I've got uh two each of these

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,840
three

43
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,480
cards so if I just like discard one copy

44
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,000
then I'll be fine right so I subtract

45
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,599
off everything that's in the

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,160
intersection uh so I had 25 before

47
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,000
subtract off those three and I end up

48
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,200
with 22 that are either hearts or uh

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,360
well these cards are too big maybe I

50
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,760
should have actually brought standard

51
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,920
cards uh I've got 22 cards that are

52
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,360
either hearts or or face cards okay does

53
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,080
that make sense to

54
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,080
people okay so this is what we call the

55
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,120
uh inclusion exclusion role or the

56
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,120
principle of inclusion and

57
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:57,560
exclusion so often abbreviated as uh Pi

58
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,000
for principle of inclusion exclusion

59
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:05,680
okay so if I have two two sets A and

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,480
B and I want to compute their Union

61
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,200
right uh the size of this Union oh well

62
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,239
this chalk is terrible um

63
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:19,400
sorry the size of their Union is going

64
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:23,440
to be the sizes of the individual

65
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,440
sets minus the size of the

66
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,920
intersection

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,959
okay does that make sense to everybody

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,760
maybe a little bit easier to see if we

69
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:38,080
uh draw a picture right

70
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:42,200
so hopefully people REM remember uh ven

71
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,040
diagrams from uh from grade school yeah

72
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,319
maybe no well this is a ven diagram

73
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,519
couple of overlapping circles so maybe

74
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:53,079
we've got hearts on one side and we've

75
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,079
got uh faces on the other right but then

76
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,159
we've got some things that are in the

77
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,159
middle so this can be our set a this can

78
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,519
be our set B and here we've got King of

79
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,439
Hearts

80
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,799
Queen of Hearts and Jack of

81
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,879
FS okay so if we want to compute the

82
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,000
size of the Union right we're going to

83
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,439
take the things that are like only on

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,920
the heart side the things that are only

85
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,079
on the face side and then the things

86
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,919
that are in the intersection we only

87
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,880
want to count them once right but that's

88
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,199
counted in both of A and B right so

89
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,360
we're going to add together the sizes of

90
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,199
A and B and then subtract out the middle

91
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,560
okay does that make sense to

92
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,960
everybody okay so what happens if we

93
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,199
have three sets

94
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,199
any

95
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,440
ideas well can we do something similar

96
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:47,560
so let's draw a three-way vend diagram

97
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,560
this

98
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:59,080
time okay so we've got a here B here C

99
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,240
here so is it true that whoops a union B

100
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,160
Union C

101
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,160
C is equal to the

102
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,280
sum of the individual sets minus the

103
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,280
parway

104
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:20,039
intersections oops that should be a

105
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:29,199
b is this

106
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,199
true yeah

107
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,680
yeah okay so your classmates's

108
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,800
observation was that uh these

109
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,520
intersections themselves overlap right

110
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,120
so if we think about how many times

111
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,880
we've counted each each item right

112
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,280
everything here we've only counted once

113
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,960
everything here we've only counted once

114
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,560
everything here we've only counted once

115
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,400
okay that's that's fairly

116
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,319
easy uh what about the things in these

117
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,160
uh kind of weirdly shaped segments right

118
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,520
so those appear in you know two of the

119
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,080
individual sets and in one of the par

120
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,360
wise intersections so we've also counted

121
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,080
these

122
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,720
ones okay but now we've got a problem in

123
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,840
the middle right how many times have we

124
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,039
counted this well we've counted it once

125
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,840
for a once for B once for C and then

126
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:32,080
we've subtracted it once each for a

127
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,240
intersect B A intersect C and B

128
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,759
intersect C Okay so we've counted this

129
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,319
zero times in

130
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:45,000
total okay so what we actually want is

131
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,000
to add back in the three-way

132
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,440
intersection

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,319
okay and that gives us the correct

134
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,360
formula okay does does that make sense

135
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:56,120
to

136
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,039
everybody

137
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,520
yeah okay so let's take a look at an

138
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,520
example

139
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:13,960
then uh how

140
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,879
many uh numbers uh K in the range from 1

141
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,360
to

142
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,360
n are co-prime with n

143
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,440
how could we figure this

144
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,919
out and those of you who already know

145
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,919
the toen function don't invoke

146
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:48,960
that how could we use uh the principle

147
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,120
of inclusion exclusion to compute this

148
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,120
any

149
00:07:52,919 --> 00:08:01,440
ideas tentative hands

150
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,440
maybe yeah see

151
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,240
okay so the idea was look at uh you know

152
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:33,080
which which numbers uh share prime

153
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,560
factor with n okay so for Simplicity

154
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,719
let's assume for now that n is the

155
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,320
product of say three primes PQ and

156
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:45,040
R

157
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:48,279
okay so then how could we figure out how

158
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,279
many things share a factor of

159
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,959
P

160
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:05,600
yeah you div y right yeah so they're

161
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:09,800
going to be uh n/ P that share a factor

162
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:14,160
of of P so let's say that

163
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,920
uh let's call the set a

164
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,720
subp the uh set of numbers and the the

165
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,040
subset of these numbers that that share

166
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,440
a factor of P okay so they're going to

167
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,680
be n/ P of those what about the things

168
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,040
that share a factor of

169
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,160
Q same thing right so similarly we can

170
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,079
define a sub Q to be the the set of

171
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,480
numbers that share a factor of

172
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:39,399
Q and then we've got this and similarly

173
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,560
a subr is going to be the set of things

174
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,560
that share a factor of

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
R

176
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,880
okay now what exactly are we trying to

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,079
compute what we really want is the

178
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,399
complement of the Union of these three

179
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:11,839
sets right so we're trying to

180
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:15,399
compute the size of n

181
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:19,839
minus a union

182
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,839
AQ Union a

183
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,880
r okay

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,920
okay so now we can use inclusion

185
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,600
exclusion we're trying to compute the

186
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,240
union of this set right that's going to

187
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,200
be the sum of the sizes of the

188
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,320
individual

189
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,399
sets right minus the oh I did this the

190
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,480
wrong way around didn't

191
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,560
I uh oh no I didn't that was the right

192
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,720
one so the the sum of the individual

193
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,360
sizes minus the sum of the parse uh

194
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,600
intersections plus the sum of the

195
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,279
three-way intersection okay so what are

196
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,279
the sizes of these

197
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,440
intersections what's the size of the

198
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:25,440
intersection of AP and AQ

199
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:40,200
yeah yeah so the answer was n/

200
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,839
PQ right so p and Q are distinct primes

201
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,320
if something shares both a factor of p

202
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,560
and a factor of Q it has to be a

203
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,880
multiple of

204
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:53,720
PQ okay so they're n/ PQ of

205
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:58,000
those similarly we have n / p

206
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,480
r and N /

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,360
QR what what about the three-way

208
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,120
intersection how many things share a

209
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:06,680
factor of PQ and

210
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,519
R

211
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:14,519
yeah yeah it's just n itself so minus

212
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,519
one

213
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:25,440
okay and if you do some uh you know

214
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,320
messy algebra this turns out to uh P

215
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,320
minus one Q - one

216
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:37,040
r -

217
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:40,959
one which is also equal to n * 1 - 1 /

218
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,160
p uh 1 - 1 /

219
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:47,160
Q 1 - 1 /

220
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,160
R

221
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,720
okay so hopefully it's not too hard to

222
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,680
see how this could generalize right uh

223
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,079
to get you know the more general form of

224
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,000
of oil

225
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:01,480
totient okay does this application make

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,279
sense to

227
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,279
people any questions

228
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:13,000
yeah oh that's just the assumption that

229
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,000
we made you for the sake of

230
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,440
example

231
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,199
okay so that's inclusion exclusion with

232
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,959
uh two or three sets but more generally

233
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:38,720
you can kind of continue the pattern

234
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:42,120
right so if you have say n sets uh A1

235
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,959
A2 all the way up to a

236
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,120
subn and you want to figure out the

237
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:48,120
union of all of these

238
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:01,720
right so as we did before we're going to

239
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,440
add up the individual sizes of the uh uh

240
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,440
of the individual

241
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:10,680
sets

242
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,240
Okay then we're going to subtract off

243
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,240
the pawise

244
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,240
intersections

245
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,600
okay then we're going to add in the

246
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,600
three-way intersections

247
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,720
right and we're just going to keep on

248
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,639
going okay until eventually we get to

249
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:48,279
you know plus or minus the size of the

250
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:51,880
nway intersection so A1 cap A2 Cap all

251
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,680
the way to a

252
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,320
subn

253
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,839
okay and the the sign on that last term

254
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,040
will depend on you know the parody of n

255
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,040
okay does that make sense to

256
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,560
people so perhaps a more formal way of

257
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,920
expressing

258
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,920
this is the

259
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:28,560
following so suppose we have some set

260
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,839
u uh which we're going to say is a union

261
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,240
of

262
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:37,160
uh n

263
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:41,040
sets Okay so this is going to be our

264
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,800
universe of discourse okay uh and so

265
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,040
this means that you know by

266
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:50,199
convention if we intersect no sets right

267
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,199
this is just going to be uh

268
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,160
U okay so just like if we Union no sets

269
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,959
we start with nothing and then you know

270
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,720
start unioning in more things and we

271
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,920
should get a union of sets

272
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,120
if we start with everything and then

273
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,000
start intersecting we should get an

274
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,240
intersection of sets so that's that's

275
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,240
where this convention comes from

276
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:16,120
yeah oh uh this this notation this

277
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:19,800
notation both oh okay so this is kind of

278
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:22,839
like the uh the big Sigma right so uh

279
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,480
just how this represents like an nway

280
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:28,040
addition uh this represents an nway

281
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,040
Union and this represents an nway

282
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,880
intersection

283
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:38,240
right uh so we've got this is saying

284
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:46,639
we've got a union of n sets like A1

285
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:50,240
Union A2 Union A3 Union a n

286
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,360
okay uh and this is saying you know

287
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,319
we've got an intersection of n sets but

288
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:59,040
n is zero so by convention we just take

289
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:59,040
that to be the entire universe

290
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,600
sorry uh the the question is why are we

291
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,120
setting both the union and the

292
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,839
intersection to be U uh this is just how

293
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,120
we're defining youu this is a

294
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:20,199
convention right so if if you intersect

295
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,919
no sets right you should get everything

296
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,120
just like if you multiply no numbers you

297
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,079
should get one it's kind of similar to

298
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,080
that right like you know you start with

299
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,559
everything and then you intersect one

300
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,280
you should get the set that you that you

301
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,200
intersected in

302
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:38,600
right okay so this is just a convention

303
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,400
uh if you prefer you can just write in U

304
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,280
itself and and what I'm about to write

305
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,840
that might make it easier to understand

306
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,520
sorry about

307
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,520
that

308
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,520
uh

309
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:58,320
okay so the theorem is

310
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,320
that uh

311
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:08,320
if you look at all subsets of the

312
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:12,320
numbers up to n right and you take uh

313
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,320
the like ey way

314
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,919
intersection of these

315
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,880
AIS right and then multiply it by minus

316
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:28,520
one to the size of

317
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,520
I this should give you zero

318
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,600
okay so now if you want to think about

319
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:41,120
this in the case of the

320
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,919
2way inclusion exclusion

321
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,280
here right so this is saying uh you know

322
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:50,960
zero equals like we move the the union

323
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,080
over to the right hand side okay or I

324
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,760
guess we're moving everything over to

325
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:59,200
the left hand side based on what I've

326
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,200
written okay yeah

327
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,760
okay uh so this formula is basically

328
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,760
what we were doing here like we're we're

329
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:11,840
kind of taking uh eyeway

330
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,840
intersections and we're you know

331
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,760
flipping the sign on on successive you

332
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,080
know sizes of I right and we're just

333
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,559
kind of moving this Union over to the

334
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,559
other side right so we get

335
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:26,039
zero okay

336
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,840
so if that formula is is too much you

337
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,039
can think about the previous formula but

338
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,039
uh

339
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,080
yeah okay so the the question was the

340
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,799
like what is the difference between big

341
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,320
and little I so big I is a set of

342
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,400
indices little I is an individual IND

343
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,840
index in that

344
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:04,720
set okay

345
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:08,120
so we're summing over you know all

346
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:11,240
subsets of the numbers up to n

347
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,880
right and then for each of those subsets

348
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,280
we're taking the intersection of the

349
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,280
relevant

350
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,240
AIS right so over here we've got a is

351
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,840
you know just it corresponds to the

352
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,880
subset just

353
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,960
one B corresponds to the subset 2 uh a

354
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,360
intersect B corresponds to the subset

355
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,960
you know 1 comma 2 and a union B

356
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,919
corresponds to the empty subset okay so

357
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,320
these are all of the subsets of uh the

358
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:42,320
integers one and two does that make

359
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,320
sense

360
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,240
question uh size of I right because I is

361
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,120
a set yeah so the question is why do we

362
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,120
have absolute value here that's the the

363
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,120
cardinality

364
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,200
okay so how could we prove

365
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:24,120
this well let's look at some X okay so

366
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:27,640
say that you know we've got some element

367
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,640
X of our universe

368
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,480
how many times do we count X on this

369
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:35,640
left hand

370
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,039
side like how many of these terms does

371
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,039
it appear

372
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,159
in well it's going to be in all of the

373
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:53,279
terms where X is in you know all of

374
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:56,120
these uh AIS okay so if we say like I

375
00:21:53,279 --> 00:22:00,960
subx

376
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,960
is the set of

377
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:09,159
indices with uh X and

378
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,159
AI

379
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,520
okay right it's going to be in the uh I

380
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:20,400
subx

381
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,960
set it's also going to be in the in like

382
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,960
every subset of I

383
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,960
subx okay

384
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,120
does that make sense do people see why

385
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:38,240
right if x is in sets one and two right

386
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,840
it's going to be in the uh in the in the

387
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,760
intersection where we've got you know I

388
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,960
is 1 two it's also going to be in the

389
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,159
intersection where I is one or where I

390
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,159
is two or where I is

391
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,159
empty

392
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:58,159
okay but now how much does it contribute

393
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,159
to the left hand side for each of these

394
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,000
well how many subsets of I subx have

395
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,000
even size and how many have odd

396
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,799
size

397
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:17,440
yeah yeah it's half each right so for

398
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:19,400
the ones of odd size we're contributing

399
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,120
minus one to the left hand side for the

400
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,400
ones of even size we're contributing

401
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,080
positive one to the right hand side or

402
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,559
to the left hand

403
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,080
side right so because they're half and

404
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,080
half those all cancel

405
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,080
okay

406
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,400
[Music]

407
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,400
so X

408
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,960
contributes +

409
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:51,480
one to left hand

410
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:54,480
side for each even

411
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,480
size

412
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,360
subset of I subx

413
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,559
and it contributes minus one to the left

414
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,159
hand

415
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,880
side for

416
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:12,880
each odd siiz

417
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,240
subset okay so when we add when we add

418
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,240
all of those together we get

419
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,120
zero okay so every element of our

420
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,880
universe contributes zero to the left

421
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,159
hand side

422
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,159
so we get

423
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,159
zero

424
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,640
okay does that make sense to

425
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,679
people

426
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:50,200
yeah uh yes we're we're looking at the

427
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,960
uh sorry question was are those both

428
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,720
supposed to be left hand side we're

429
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,960
looking at what x contributes to this

430
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,480
sum okay like how many of these terms

431
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,559
does it contribute positively to how

432
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:05,159
many does it contribute negatively to so

433
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:07,080
whenever the uh size of I is even it's

434
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,240
going to contribute positively if it's

435
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,000
contained in that intersection whenever

436
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:15,080
the size of I is odd it'll contribute

437
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,080
negatively when it's in the intersection

438
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,080
okay

439
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,320
yeah uh

440
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,840
sorry the the question was how do we

441
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,960
construct a big I so that the

442
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,960
intersection is the empty

443
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,919
Set

444
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,480
uh okay let let me let me see if I'm

445
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:54,799
understanding um you are trying to find

446
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:58,799
an I such that uh this is empty or such

447
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,799
that this is empty

448
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:06,480
this one okay so we don't care uh we are

449
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,080
looking at the sets that contain X so

450
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,080
they should never be

451
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,080
empty

452
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,960
okay like we're we're kind of looking at

453
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,159
uh you know what we had here like how

454
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,159
many times have we counted

455
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:28,559
X

456
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,640
okay so if this is still confusing uh

457
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,760
please review the lecture notes or uh

458
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,080
you know it's not important that the

459
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,679
proof is not important the most

460
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,440
important thing is you know knowing how

461
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:44,080
to use it right so you want to add

462
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,279
together the the uh the single sets

463
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,279
subtract off the the parse intersections

464
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:50,000
add together the three-way intersections

465
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:52,919
Etc

466
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,880
okay so let's move on to the second

467
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:58,399
topic for

468
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,399
today Pidgey hole principle

469
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:12,120
okay has anybody heard of this

470
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:14,360
before yeah okay uh so the pidy hole

471
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,679
principle it gets its name from you know

472
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,320
Medieval Times you have uh a bunch of

473
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,600
you know Pidgey holes that are supposed

474
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,120
to contain pidgeys uh but what if you

475
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,360
have more pidgeys than Pidgey holes

476
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,679
right what

477
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,399
happens well two of them have to share

478
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:30,880
right two of them get squished okay so

479
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:35,720
that's basically what the uh what the

480
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:35,720
pidal principle is saying if we have two

481
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,360
sets A and

482
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:44,159
B where uh the size of a is greater than

483
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,159
the size of

484
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,159
B

485
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:54,720
and F from A to

486
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,720
B is total right then F cannot be

487
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,720
injective

488
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:21,640
right so if a is our set of pigeons

489
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:23,720
right B is our set of pigeon holes and F

490
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,480
is saying you know pigeon a lives in

491
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,200
pigeon hole B

492
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,320
right uh this should be a total function

493
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,960
right like every Pidgey should have a

494
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,919
home right we don't want to have

495
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,320
homeless

496
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,600
pidgeys uh so it's a total

497
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,279
function right but that means that it

498
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,880
can't be injective meaning that there

499
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,159
have to be two pigeons that share a

500
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,159
pigeon

501
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:50,880
hole

502
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,880
okay so let's look at a couple of

503
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,430
[Applause]

504
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,000
examples do we still have 26 students in

505
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,840
the room

506
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,640
nice not too many students have dropped

507
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:07,799
okay so there are more than 26 students

508
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,159
in the room so at least two of you uh

509
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:14,120
share the first letter of your first

510
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:16,600
name right uh so we've got well at least

511
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,600
27

512
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,519
students and 26 letters of the

513
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,960
alphabet so if we map every student

514
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:33,039
right right to the first letter of their

515
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,559
first name right that's a total function

516
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,559
so it can't be

517
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:54,120
injective okay so two students must

518
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,120
share

519
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,320
okay does that example make

520
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,320
sense

521
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:13,559
right okay uh what if I've got n

522
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:16,159
differently colored pairs of socks

523
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:18,399
right don't worry about

524
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,919
it how many socks do I need to pull out

525
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,200
of my drawer to ensure that I get two of

526
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,200
the same

527
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,480
color

528
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:30,559
sorry yeah the answer was uh n plus one

529
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:33,720
right so in my case

530
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,080
two so if I've got n socks or sorry n

531
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,080
colors of

532
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,200
socks need n+

533
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,159
one to guarantee a

534
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,840
pair okay so I've been a little bit

535
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,600
handwavy with this

536
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,519
one when you're trying to prove

537
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,320
something with the pigeon hole principle

538
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:07,720
you generally need to be very careful

539
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,240
about what your pigeons are what your

540
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:10,639
pigeon holes are and what the map

541
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,639
between them

542
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:13,639
is

543
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,720
okay so what are those three elements in

544
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:19,720
this case

545
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,360
maybe we could phrase it instead as you

546
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,919
know if I have n plus one then it

547
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,919
guarantees a

548
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,080
pair

549
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,360
yeah okay so a is the set of socks

550
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:03,000
and B is a set of

551
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:10,279
colors and the map is going to map the

552
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,279
sock to its

553
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,559
color okay does that make sense to

554
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,080
everybody

555
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:32,159
okay uh does anybody know what the

556
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,159
population of Boston

557
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:40,080
is are you looking at the lecture

558
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,559
notes oh

559
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,840
okay yeah about 650,000 as of you know

560
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:47,360
however many decades ago these lecture

561
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:49,039
notes were written um I don't actually

562
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,460
know that that was very long ago it

563
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:54,710
could be current

564
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,710
[Applause]

565
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:11,279
is anybody a uh human biology nerd does

566
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,279
anybody know how many hairs humans

567
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,720
have so it turns out humans

568
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:26,600
have less than about

569
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,760
200,000

570
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,760
hairs okay

571
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,200
so what does the pitch and hole

572
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,200
principle tell us

573
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,960
here any

574
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,480
ideas getting some face Palms

575
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,360
yeah oh good point so the answer was at

576
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,840
least three uh humans in Boston have the

577
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,840
same number of

578
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,720
pairis okay so as stated all we know is

579
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,040
that you know at least two bostonians

580
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,079
have the same number of hairs right so

581
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,159
does that mean that there's somebody

582
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:27,159
with the same number of hairs as me

583
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,040
not necessarily right uh so we know that

584
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,240
there exists two bostonians we don't

585
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,040
know who they are right uh this this is

586
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,159
non-constructive right it it only tells

587
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,240
us of

588
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,960
existence uh but your your colleague

589
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:47,440
also brings up another good point uh

590
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,679
because this 650,000 is so much larger

591
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,119
than the 200,000 we can actually say

592
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,760
something stronger right like all we

593
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:59,240
need is is 200,000 plus 1 right that'll

594
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,560
give us a a a of two

595
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:05,040
bostonians right we've actually got more

596
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,520
than three times that number right so

597
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,400
there are more than three

598
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,839
bostonians who have the same number of

599
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,320
hairs so in fact we can conclude that

600
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,440
there are at least four

601
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,560
bostonians who all have the same number

602
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,560
of

603
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,560
hairs

604
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,520
okay does that make sense to everybody

605
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,839
yeah

606
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,359
did ah so the the question was how did

607
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:29,640
we get the four

608
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:32,640
right so this is what we call the

609
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,640
generalized pigeon hole

610
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:46,640
principle okay so up here right we just

611
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:49,760
said you know if a is is larger than

612
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:55,960
b but if we have the stronger condition

613
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,960
that if a is larger than K *

614
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:03,440
B right right then we've got a K plus

615
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,440
1way Collision not just a two-way

616
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:29,079
Collision

617
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:32,599
okay so because you know we have 650,000

618
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:35,079
which is more than three times 200,000

619
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:36,640
we've got a 3 plus oneway Collision not

620
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:40,240
just a three-way Collision does that

621
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,240
make sense

622
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,000
yeah yeah uh I suppose we could include

623
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,280
zero but I guess there're everybody

624
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,359
knows that there're are bald bostonians

625
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,720
so maybe we exclude that um but yeah

626
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:01,400
every natural number from uh from one up

627
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,079
to 200,000 was is going to be our B and

628
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,880
our a is going to be the set of all

629
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:08,040
bostonians right and we are mapping a

630
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,040
person to the number of pairs that they

631
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,040
have

632
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:20,160
okay okay so you can like you can

633
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:21,880
basically always use the generalized uh

634
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,520
pigeon hole principle if you would you

635
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,839
know just like strong induction will

636
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,800
always work whenever whenever weak

637
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:29,800
induction

638
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:32,599
does uh you could always set k equal 1

639
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,960
right

640
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:38,640
uh but like the the proof is basically

641
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,280
the same um and if you use these to uh

642
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,640
to to prove things about functions uh

643
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,839
the proofs can often be you know very

644
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:48,560
short very simple uh but they can Al

645
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:51,599
they can also sometimes require some

646
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:57,079
cleverness okay so it it may not always

647
00:37:51,599 --> 00:38:00,720
be obvious what a b and F should be okay

648
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:00,720
so here here's a slightly more involved

649
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,560
example okay so we have an 8 by8 chest

650
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,960
board and 33

651
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,880
Rooks does everybody know how uh how

652
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,839
chess works you know

653
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:36,960
vaguely okay so Rooks can move along you

654
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:41,200
know ranks or files right ranks or files

655
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:44,839
sorry um so we would like to place these

656
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:49,520
these Rooks so that uh no five or so

657
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:51,640
that any set of five right uh they don't

658
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:57,599
all attack each

659
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:59,800
other or no I I phrased that wrong uh so

660
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,160
we want to find five of them where none

661
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,480
of them attack each other right so

662
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,880
basically we want them all to be in

663
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:10,839
distinct uh rows and files so if we've

664
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:13,880
got you know something like

665
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:16,280
this right if we have a rook here a rook

666
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,680
here and a rook here those three do not

667
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:22,720
attack each other okay so we're trying

668
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,800
to find a set of five like that right

669
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,160
like no two of them share a column or a

670
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,359
row does the uh does the setup make

671
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,359
sense

672
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:34,000
okay how could we do

673
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,200
that rather how could we prove the

674
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,200
existence of such a

675
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,920
set maybe it would help to draw out the

676
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:53,920
chessboard let's

677
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,480
see one two

678
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:04,680
three

679
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:09,520
four five six

680
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:13,560
7 one two three

681
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:18,440
four five six seven

682
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:18,440
okay there's our wonky chest board

683
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,920
okay so how could we do this any

684
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,920
ideas

685
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:02,280
yeah okay so the answer is if we place

686
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,640
four Rooks they cover at most 2 to the

687
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,640
five

688
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,280
squares

689
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:13,280
uh is that

690
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:16,319
true uh I don't think that's true right

691
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,040
like if we place Rooks in these four uh

692
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,359
squares right they're going to cover 3/4

693
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:24,839
of the

694
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,839
chessboard okay uh yes

695
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,119
uh that's

696
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,400
right

697
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:51,760
pardon uh so what what is your solution

698
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,359
then oh oh sorry I think you may have

699
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,160
misunderstood the problem um you know we

700
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,760
we have 33 Rooks right we're trying to

701
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,880
find a set of five that don't attack

702
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,599
each other we're we're given the

703
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,200
placement right we're not allowed to

704
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,480
just Place five Rooks if we could place

705
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,680
them then yeah we could we could you

706
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,520
know place them along a diagonal and

707
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,440
then we've got eight right so like you

708
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,880
know some of these have have Rooks we

709
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,880
don't get to control where

710
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,040
right right and we're trying to find

711
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,760
some subset of these uh some subset of

712
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,400
five of these that don't attack each

713
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,559
other

714
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:35,160
does the problem setup make

715
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:37,800
sense maybe yes no

716
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,400
yeah okay so how could we use the pigeon

717
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,400
hole principle

718
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:51,200
here well perhaps let's start with the

719
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,200
easiest element what should our pigeons

720
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:00,040
be what are we trying to make Collide

721
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:03,040
yeah Rooks yeah so our pigeons are going

722
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,040
to be the Rooks and I've lost my

723
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:21,359
Eraser

724
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:25,000
okay

725
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:28,240
now what should our pigeon holes

726
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,880
be right we want

727
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,240
we want to set it up so that if we get a

728
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,240
five-way

729
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,680
collision right those five Rooks do not

730
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,680
attack each

731
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,800
other

732
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,280
yeah yeah so the answer was you know

733
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,079
we're placing these Rooks on the chest

734
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:58,000
board so let's make the pigeon holes the

735
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,000
uh the squares of the chest board

736
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,400
okay so you are off to a good start

737
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,720
that's a good idea uh the problem right

738
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,079
now is that we've got uh fewer Rooks

739
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:19,079
than squares on the

740
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:22,160
chessboard okay so what we really want

741
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:25,800
is a five-way collision right so we want

742
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:30,000
to ensure that we have more than four

743
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:33,000
times as many Brooks as pigeon

744
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,480
holes okay so is there a way that we can

745
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,920
modify your

746
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:41,359
solution uh to make you know fewer

747
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,359
things where Collision is still good for

748
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:51,000
us so can we can we subdivide our

749
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:53,640
squares so we have

750
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,240
yeah

751
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,960
sorry okay the the answer was squares

752
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,280
that don't have rope Rooks um that's not

753
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,800
going to be very helpful right like

754
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,319
we're we're assigning Rooks to Pigeon

755
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:08,119
holes so the the you know the map should

756
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:10,040
map Rooks to you know occupied squares

757
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:12,440
of of some

758
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:15,400
sort but how could we maybe split up the

759
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:18,040
chessboard into eight pigeon holes right

760
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,240
if we have eight pigeon holes 33 Rooks

761
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,800
right that's more than four times as

762
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,800
many so we get a five-way

763
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,960
collision what could our eight sets of

764
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:29,960
squares be

765
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:33,480
yeah colums okay so if we have five

766
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,480
Rooks in a column is that

767
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:40,079
helpful now all of those Works attack

768
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,760
each other

769
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,760
then you're getting close though

770
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,240
yeah yeah so the answer was you know

771
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:55,040
diagonals but then offset

772
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,200
them okay so I'm going to number all of

773
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:01,119
these squares so so everything numbered

774
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:04,079
one is going to be our first pigeon hole

775
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,440
okay so if we get five Rooks along the

776
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,400
main diagonal like all of them are going

777
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,240
to be in different rows and different

778
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:13,079
columns so they won't attack each other

779
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:16,200
okay so that's good right number two is

780
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:16,200
going to be offset by

781
00:46:16,359 --> 00:46:20,280
one but then we're also going to wrap

782
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,400
around down

783
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,359
here okay so once again we've got eight

784
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,400
squares that are all in different rows

785
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:30,760
and different columns so if we get five

786
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,720
on you know two squares they also don't

787
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,200
attack each other okay and we can

788
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,440
continue in this way right three goes

789
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:41,520
along

790
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,480
here and then these two squares

791
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:47,520
Etc

792
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:51,240
okay so now we have uh eight pigeon

793
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:53,760
holes 33 Rooks so that's more than four

794
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:56,520
times as many we get a five-way

795
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,400
collision uh whichever you know number

796
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,680
of square has that five-way Collision

797
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,800
those are five Rooks that don't attack

798
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,800
each

799
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:07,119
other

800
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,559
okay does does that make sense to

801
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,839
everybody so it took a little bit of

802
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:19,160
creativity to come up with the pigeon

803
00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:19,160
holes

804
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:26,319
here but once we have that the proof is

805
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:26,319
fairly straightforward

806
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:34,160
okay so let's change gears a little bit

807
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:35,280
and move on to uh the last counting

808
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:39,640
technique for

809
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,640
today which we call combinatorial

810
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,800
proofs or double

811
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,800
counting

812
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:02,079
oops okay okay so I like to think of

813
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,280
this as somewhat similar to uh I believe

814
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,920
you've seen the baction rule earlier

815
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,920
right so if you have two sets and you

816
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,440
can come up with a baction between them

817
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:15,040
then those two sets have the same size

818
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:17,240
right well similarly if you have two

819
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:21,079
sizes and a single set that shares those

820
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:24,240
sizes right those sizes must be equal

821
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:27,040
okay so basically this is a proof

822
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,040
technique where we take a set and kind

823
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:31,079
of count it in two different ways okay

824
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,240
and that can give us some nice

825
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:36,760
combinatorial

826
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,760
identities so for

827
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,200
instance we have this identity have

828
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,960
people seen this one

829
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,000
before

830
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,079
no okay so if you uh if you sum up and

831
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,640
choose k for you know all K from 0 to n

832
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:03,040
you just get 2 the

833
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,559
N so if you haven't seen it before it's

834
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,319
you know perhaps a little bit

835
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:09,160
counterintuitive right like we've got a

836
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:11,280
summation of you know a bunch of things

837
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,920
involving factorials but it turns out to

838
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,480
be some nice uh

839
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:18,559
exponential

840
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,559
okay so how could we prove

841
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:25,920
this how could we come up with a

842
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:27,640
set that we can count you know both as

843
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,240
this expression

844
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,240
and as this

845
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:35,400
expression any

846
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,400
ideas

847
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:46,760
yeah so the solution was count length

848
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,760
and binary sequences

849
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:03,240
okay so how does that give you each side

850
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,240
of the uh of the

851
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,400
equality

852
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,839
okay exactly

853
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,280
yeah so the the right hand side is

854
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:34,680
fairly straightforward

855
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:37,839
right right if we're counting length and

856
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:40,520
binary sequences like every uh position

857
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:43,599
you can either have zero or one right so

858
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,599
product rule gives us to the

859
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:55,240
n and for the left hand

860
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:58,079
side we're going to partition based on

861
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,720
how many ones there are in our

862
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,960
sequence

863
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:05,119
okay so our sequence could have any

864
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:08,839
number of ones from0 up to n

865
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:10,640
inclusive okay so and all of these are

866
00:51:08,839 --> 00:51:12,280
disjoint right if it has three ones it

867
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:15,359
can't also have eight

868
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:19,440
ones okay so by our sum rule we can just

869
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:22,319
sum up all of the sizes of those

870
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:27,799
sets what is the size of the set of

871
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:27,799
sequences that has say three ones

872
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,799
anybody how many binary sequences of

873
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,799
length n have three

874
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:58,480
ones n choose three yeah or more

875
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:00,720
generally you know they n choose k

876
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,720
with

877
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:10,040
k1s and you know K from one through uh

878
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,040
from zero through

879
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,240
n form a partition of our

880
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:22,880
set

881
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,160
okay so if we sum up all of these

882
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,040
binomial coefficients from 0 to

883
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:28,640
n right

884
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,079
we're also going to get the the number

885
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,400
of length then binary

886
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:35,760
sequences okay does that does that make

887
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,760
sense to

888
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:41,559
everybody okay does the proof technique

889
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,240
make sense to everybody right we're

890
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:45,599
we're taking a single set and we're

891
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:48,880
counting it in two different

892
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,720
ways right and each way of counting

893
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,960
gives us a different expression so those

894
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,440
two expressions must be

895
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,440
equal

896
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,400
okay so the key here you know is

897
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,400
choosing the right set to

898
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:23,839
count so as it turns out that's actually

899
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,880
a special case of a uh of a nice

900
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:28,640
theorem uh so we we've been using

901
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,280
binomial coefficients quite a lot right

902
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:34,920
these uh n choose K uh terms does

903
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,920
anybody know their

904
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:41,200
eponym any

905
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,960
ideas has anybody encountered the

906
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,960
binomial theorem

907
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:52,760
before no okay well let's take a

908
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:52,760
look Okay so

909
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:14,280
okay

910
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:17,960
so this here is what we call a binomial

911
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:20,520
right uh you know sum of two

912
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:22,280
monomials uh and the binomial theorem

913
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,680
says that if we take a binomial raise it

914
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:27,480
to the N power right then we get you

915
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,400
know basically the same thing as we had

916
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:33,760
on the left hand side over there but you

917
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:36,240
know we've got these uh powers of X and

918
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:40,200
Y

919
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:43,079
okay and you know by convention 0 to the

920
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:46,079
0o we just say that that's equal to

921
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:46,079
one

922
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:52,000
okay so the uh

923
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:56,400
uh the proof

924
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:05,079
does anybody know how we might prove

925
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:05,079
this it's fairly similar to what we just

926
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:19,160
did well what happens if we expand out

927
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,160
the left hand

928
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,319
side what do we get

929
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:43,760
yeah okay uh so the answer was we got

930
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:45,480
the coefficients of Pascal's triangle uh

931
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:49,520
you've skipped a couple of

932
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:49,520
steps more immediately what do we

933
00:55:52,039 --> 00:55:57,559
get like say if n equals 2 what do we

934
00:55:54,839 --> 00:56:01,520
get

935
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:02,720
we get XX plus X Y plus YX plus y y

936
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,799
right like we've basically got a bunch

937
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:08,000
of binary sequences of x's and

938
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:11,680
y's

939
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:16,880
okay so this gives us a

940
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,880
sum of 2 to the N uh

941
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,319
terms of the

942
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:28,480
form uh and I'll call it you know B1 B2

943
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:32,760
up to

944
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,760
BN where each

945
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:40,520
B is either X or

946
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,520
Y

947
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:53,119
okay so now how do we get Pascal out of

948
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:53,119
that

949
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:11,359
so you're talking about coefficients

950
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:15,520
what are these Coe like what are the

951
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:15,520
coefficients of where are we getting the

952
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,200
coefficients not quite of X and

953
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:30,520
Y so we're going to want to group like

954
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:33,160
terms right so both multiplication and

955
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:35,920
addition are commutative so we can kind

956
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:37,440
of fiddle around with uh each of those

957
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,559
terms and you know put all the X's at

958
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,160
the beginning and the Y's at the end and

959
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:43,359
then we can also rearrange the terms so

960
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:47,400
that you know we put like terms

961
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:50,760
together okay so we can group them into

962
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,760
a bunch of

963
00:57:53,839 --> 00:58:02,760
uh terms of the form at x k * y nus

964
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:05,799
k uh and then multiplied by su

965
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:08,799
coefficient C

966
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:08,799
subk

967
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:17,039
okay so now as your colleague was saying

968
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:18,440
right those C subk are going to be you

969
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:20,200
know the entries of Pascal's triangle

970
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:24,839
they're going to be the uh binomial

971
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,839
coefficients okay why is that

972
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,920
well how many terms are there of this

973
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:42,640
form well it could come from putting the

974
00:58:38,839 --> 00:58:46,440
K x's in you know any K places from

975
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:48,200
among the uh uh the N possible places

976
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:51,240
right so you've got n choose K possible

977
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:54,280
places or possible ways to place the X's

978
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:55,319
the Y's will be the the remaining ones

979
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,039
uh and each of those gives you a

980
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:58,039
different term

981
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:08,440
okay so C

982
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:08,440
subk is going to be n k similar to

983
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,240
above does that make sense to

984
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,960
everybody so if we specifically put in X

985
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,680
and Y are both equal to one then we

986
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:29,520
recover what we had uh originally

987
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:32,480
you may also have uh encountered uh a

988
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:34,520
form of this theorem where y equals 1

989
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,760
have have people seen that before like 1

990
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,760
plus x to the uh to the

991
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,760
N possibly maybe

992
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:51,880
not okay well it is a useful theorem the

993
00:59:49,559 --> 00:59:54,640
coefficients on the terms are the uh you

994
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,839
know n chose K the binomial coefficients

995
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,880
and you know this is where their name

996
00:59:55,839 --> 01:00:01,000
comes

997
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:02,839
from okay and uh more generally you can

998
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,559
also get the uh multinomial theorem in

999
01:00:02,839 --> 01:00:09,480
the same way right if you have uh you

1000
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,559
know X Plus y+ Z for instance raise that

1001
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,039
to the nth power uh you start getting

1002
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:15,480
multinomial coefficients instead of

1003
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:15,480
binomial

1004
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,680
coefficients okay

1005
01:00:50,119 --> 01:00:56,240
yeah sorry I'm moving all the way over

1006
01:00:51,799 --> 01:00:56,240
here I didn't plan this up very well

1007
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,599
okay so for the multinomial theor right

1008
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:26,960
if we have a multinomial here like we've

1009
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:28,480
got mx's instead of just two right

1010
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,240
uh if we sum all those up and then raise

1011
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,559
it to the N power we can use essentially

1012
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:36,720
the same proof to show that this is

1013
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:38,640
going to be the sum over all uh

1014
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,240
sequences

1015
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:43,400
K1

1016
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:48,280
K2 all the way up to K

1017
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:52,559
subm uh where these all sum up to

1018
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:56,319
n of the multinomial coefficient and

1019
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:58,799
choose K1 K2

1020
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,799
up to

1021
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:05,319
km of you know similar to the uh x to

1022
01:02:02,599 --> 01:02:09,799
the k y the N minus K term we had over

1023
01:02:05,319 --> 01:02:09,799
there this time we've got a product of M

1024
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:20,599
things

1025
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:24,359
okay so essentially the same proof right

1026
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:27,160
uh you know if we uh uh if we think of

1027
01:02:24,359 --> 01:02:29,200
the uh the binom coefficients right as

1028
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,599
you know multinomial coefficients where

1029
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:33,480
we've only got two

1030
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:37,440
things right you can kind of see how it

1031
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,440
expands right

1032
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:42,720
uh we're going to look at you know all

1033
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:46,599
possible ways that you could you know

1034
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:50,839
Place x1's x2s x3s

1035
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:52,440
Etc uh among the N different

1036
01:02:50,839 --> 01:02:56,520
terms

1037
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:58,359
uh and each of those is going to give us

1038
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:00,400
a different term that we can then

1039
01:02:58,359 --> 01:03:03,880
combine uh when we're grouping like

1040
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:06,480
terms does that make sense to

1041
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:09,240
people so the number of those the number

1042
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:13,119
of ways that you can you know permute

1043
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:14,920
those uh those nend

1044
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:18,960
things that's just going to be this

1045
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,960
multinomial coefficient here

1046
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:32,839
[Applause]

1047
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,000
okay are people happy with the uh

1048
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:48,720
binomial multinomial

1049
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:53,000
coefficients and the binomial

1050
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,000
multinomial theorems yeah

1051
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:05,000
uh

1052
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:07,960
so the the question is uh what what does

1053
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,920
this mean um is this the notation that

1054
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:13,680
you saw in the bookkeeper uh

1055
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:17,680
recitation uh perhaps not if if not this

1056
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:21,400
is uh equal to n factorial

1057
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:27,400
/ K1 factorial K2

1058
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:29,960
factorial all the way up to km factorial

1059
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,960
okay so it's kind of an extension of the

1060
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,440
binomial coefficients right with the

1061
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:36,359
binomial coefficients you just have you

1062
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:38,799
know two k that sum to

1063
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:40,799
n uh and we also kind of simplify the

1064
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:42,839
notation by just you know dropping one

1065
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:44,559
of the uh dropping one of the ks because

1066
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:47,000
it's redundant in that

1067
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:49,680
case uh but you know for the multinomial

1068
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,400
coefficients we have you know a bunch of

1069
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:54,200
KS that sum to n instead of just two uh

1070
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,680
we're going to divide n factorial by you

1071
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,400
know the product of all of them

1072
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:00,880
okay does that does that make sense does

1073
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:03,480
that answer your question

1074
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,520
okay any other questions about binomial

1075
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,520
multinomial

1076
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:11,200
theorems

1077
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:13,559
yeah sorry oh question what is the pi uh

1078
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:16,480
so this is an analog of Sigma but for

1079
01:05:13,559 --> 01:05:19,839
products instead of sums so we're saying

1080
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:25,240
you know x i to the Ki like multiplied

1081
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:30,319
over all possible I so X1 to the K1 * X2

1082
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:33,039
to the k 2 time X3 to the K3

1083
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:37,279
Etc

1084
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:37,279
okay so Pi for

1085
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,480
product any other

1086
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:53,799
questions okay so why don't we move on

1087
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:57,640
to another useful identity that we can

1088
01:05:53,799 --> 01:05:57,640
prove using a uh a combinatorial

1089
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:03,079
proof

1090
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,799
oops and choose k

1091
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:08,559
equals n -1 choose Kus

1092
01:06:06,799 --> 01:06:13,039
one

1093
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:13,039
plus nus one choose

1094
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:20,599
K okay who has seen this before I know

1095
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:20,599
that at least one of you

1096
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:30,799
has few hands

1097
01:06:27,079 --> 01:06:32,680
okay uh so uh we could prove it you know

1098
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:35,480
algebraically just you know writing them

1099
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:38,160
out with factorials and you know doing a

1100
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:39,960
bunch of fiddly garbage uh but that

1101
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:43,160
seems a bit difficult so let's use a

1102
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:45,400
double counting proof instead

1103
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:48,760
okay how might we use a double counting

1104
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,760
proof to prove this

1105
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,520
identity what set could we try and count

1106
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:03,799
any

1107
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,440
ideas

1108
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:25,000
yeah yeah good answer okay so the the

1109
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:27,920
answer was uh you know once again we can

1110
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,720
look at binary sequences of length n but

1111
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,240
this time we're going to restrict it to

1112
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:34,119
Binary sequences of length n that

1113
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:38,520
specifically have

1114
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:42,119
k1s okay so

1115
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:42,119
count uh binary

1116
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:53,160
sequences of length

1117
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,160
n with

1118
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:57,440
k1s okay

1119
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,880
now how many of those are

1120
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:09,240
there does that give us one of our two

1121
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:09,240
expressions

1122
01:08:10,279 --> 01:08:14,799
easily if so

1123
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,400
which

1124
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:19,839
yeah

1125
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:21,960
sorry yeah so essentially by definition

1126
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:24,679
right like this is equal to the the size

1127
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:27,440
of this set is going to be and choose k

1128
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:27,440
okay

1129
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:35,359
so let's call this set

1130
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:54,159
s okay how could we also make S equal to

1131
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,159
the right hand side

1132
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,279
does this give us any ideas

1133
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,279
yeah

1134
01:09:40,199 --> 01:09:43,199
answer

1135
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:57,480
yeah yeah so the the answer was

1136
01:09:53,920 --> 01:10:01,320
essentially we're going to par our set

1137
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:03,000
okay so what are we partitioning on well

1138
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,840
we're going to look at the last bit of

1139
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,120
the

1140
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,310
sequence

1141
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:10,520
okay

1142
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:10,520
[Music]

1143
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:29,679
so okay so so we've got two cases right

1144
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:33,520
the last bit can either be zero or one

1145
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:36,040
it can't be both right so we've got you

1146
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:38,719
know we've got a

1147
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,800
partition okay that means that we can

1148
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:43,320
use the sum

1149
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:46,679
rule we can count each of these sets

1150
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:48,159
individually and then add their sizes

1151
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:49,400
together that'll give us the size of our

1152
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:51,320
original

1153
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:55,800
set

1154
01:10:51,320 --> 01:11:00,040
okay so how many length and sequence

1155
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,040
with k1s have a one at the

1156
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:11,080
end

1157
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:14,880
yeah

1158
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:17,440
yeah

1159
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,719
so the answer was n minus one choose K

1160
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,719
minus one

1161
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:54,920
okay so let's partition this

1162
01:11:49,159 --> 01:11:54,920
s s0 Union S1

1163
01:11:57,239 --> 01:12:06,920
s0 or let's call it S Sub B is

1164
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,920
the set of binary

1165
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,440
sequences with n1's uh

1166
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:15,440
sorry n

1167
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:21,600
Bits

1168
01:12:17,719 --> 01:12:25,320
k1s and B at the

1169
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:28,080
end okay

1170
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:32,080
so S Sub

1171
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:36,239
1 is going to have size n minus1 chose

1172
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:39,159
Kus one right if we know that we've got

1173
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:40,960
a one at the end right we've got K minus

1174
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:44,560
one additional ones that we need to

1175
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:46,719
place right where can they go into any

1176
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,719
of the first n minus one

1177
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:49,719
positions

1178
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:56,520
okay so there are n minus one choose K

1179
01:12:52,639 --> 01:12:59,080
minus one ways to choose those

1180
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,080
and what about

1181
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:16,679
s

1182
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,960
yeah

1183
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:22,920
yeah this is going to be n minus one

1184
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,920
choose K and why is

1185
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:29,639
that yeah if we've got a zero at the end

1186
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:32,880
right we still need to place those k1s

1187
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:35,159
somewhere right so now we've only got

1188
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:37,440
nus one places where we can put them but

1189
01:13:35,159 --> 01:13:39,480
we still have k1s that we need to place

1190
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,719
okay so there n minus1 choose K ways to

1191
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,719
place

1192
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:44,960
them

1193
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:53,679
okay so these two cases are exhaustive

1194
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:55,360
right you can't have uh like you can't

1195
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:58,159
have a sequence that ends with nether a

1196
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:59,600
zero or one it's a binary sequence right

1197
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:02,320
they're also disjoint you can't have

1198
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:06,199
both a zero and a one at the end so this

1199
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:09,280
forms a partition right so by the sum

1200
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:14,000
rule the size of s is going to be the

1201
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:17,880
size of s not plus the size of

1202
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:20,440
S1 which we just established is I guess

1203
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:20,440
I flip them

1204
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:27,920
around nus one choose K plus nus1 choose

1205
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:32,760
kus1

1206
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:35,239
okay and as we established at the

1207
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:38,800
beginning this is also equal

1208
01:14:35,239 --> 01:14:38,800
to and

1209
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:44,760
K okay does that make sense to everybody

1210
01:15:03,239 --> 01:15:09,239
do people have any questions about uh

1211
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:12,239
either this Identity or uh combinatorial

1212
01:15:09,239 --> 01:15:12,239
proofs

1213
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:22,719
yeah yeah the the question was is there

1214
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:25,400
any reason we uh didn't you know write

1215
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:28,560
out the definition of n k using the

1216
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:32,360
factorials simplify things uh because

1217
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,360
I'm a lazy folk and I don't want to

1218
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:41,400
um yeah so that that kind of depends on

1219
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:43,719
so the the the concern right was that

1220
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:47,400
this uh you know maybe this takes a lot

1221
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:48,560
longer than just uh you know putting

1222
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,800
your head down and going through all of

1223
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,880
the messy

1224
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:55,400
algebra um yeah at the beginning it it

1225
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:57,719
probably will right like uh if you are

1226
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,800
not familiar with this proof technique

1227
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:01,480
right it may not be obvious you know

1228
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:04,120
what set you should be counting or how

1229
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:07,159
you should be counting it uh but as you

1230
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:09,360
get practice right uh it could be much

1231
01:16:07,159 --> 01:16:14,719
easier than you know just trying to to

1232
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:17,080
bruteforce it and uh I think in in uh uh

1233
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:18,800
possibly in recitation and homework you

1234
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:21,920
will see other

1235
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:24,320
identities where it may be less viable

1236
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,239
to you know actually you know go through

1237
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:27,760
the messy algeb

1238
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:30,840
right

1239
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,320
um so you know yeah this is kind of a

1240
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:34,520
silly example and it's one where you

1241
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:37,000
could definitely solve it in in other

1242
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:38,560
ways uh and in fact you know those of

1243
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,520
you who have seen this identity before I

1244
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,800
imagine you probably did prove it in

1245
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:45,920
other ways right uh but it's just kind

1246
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:48,280
of illustrative of of this particular

1247
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,400
proof technique does that does that

1248
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:51,400
answer your

1249
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:53,920
question

1250
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:56,840
okay uh any other questions comments

1251
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,840
concerns

1252
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:18,239
okay

1253
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:18,239
so as your colleague was hinting at

1254
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:25,560
earlier this kind of gives us the

1255
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:27,120
following

1256
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:30,239
so I imagine many of you have seen

1257
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:32,920
Pascal's triangle before but if you kind

1258
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:37,320
of just you know write out all of the

1259
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:39,480
binomial coefficients uh in like rows of

1260
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,480
a

1261
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:54,199
triangle so like this is uh n = 0 n = 1

1262
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:56,199
Nal 2 Nal 3 and then you know successive

1263
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:58,360
uh entries in a row are going to be like

1264
01:17:56,199 --> 01:18:03,280
n choose zero n choose one n choose 2

1265
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:03,280
Etc okay so if you write all of these

1266
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:18,040
out right what we just proved is that

1267
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:20,600
every entry of this triangle right is

1268
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:24,639
the sum of the two entries above

1269
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:28,600
it right so if we take this four and

1270
01:18:24,639 --> 01:18:31,440
this six here they sum to 10 okay that

1271
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:32,920
is uh that is essentially what this what

1272
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,600
this identity is

1273
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:37,159
saying

1274
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,600
okay uh so this is what we call you know

1275
01:18:37,159 --> 01:18:43,400
Pascal's

1276
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:46,960
triangle um we also showed that the sum

1277
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:48,360
of all of the numbers in a single row is

1278
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:53,199
going to be a power of two right it's

1279
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:53,199
going to be uh 2 to the n

1280
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:05,960
like if we sum everything in row five we

1281
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:10,760
get 1 + 5 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 =

1282
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:13,719
32 okay that was uh I think we proved it

1283
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:15,080
over there yeah top of the uh top of the

1284
01:19:13,719 --> 01:19:16,880
rightmost

1285
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,520
board

1286
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:24,600
okay and

1287
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:26,120
um you will see uh I believe in homework

1288
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:29,480
that that if you sum the diagonals you

1289
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:37,080
get the Fibonacci numbers right so if

1290
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:37,080
you kind of uh let's see so go like

1291
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:44,600
that right if you Sum along these

1292
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:46,199
diagonals you get the Fibonacci numbers

1293
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:48,760
uh is am I correct is that still a

1294
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:51,600
homework problem or

1295
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:55,560
uh maybe sorry I've not actually looked

1296
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,560
at your homework uh full disclosure

1297
01:19:55,639 --> 01:19:59,920
uh it's a fun exercise if you want to

1298
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:02,520
try it

1299
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,400
um but I will leave you with one more

1300
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,199
fun

1301
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:11,760
exercise prove

1302
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:13,760
that uh the sum from k equals 0 to n and

1303
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:17,880
choose K

1304
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:19,880
squared is going to be 2 N choose

1305
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,560
n

1306
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:25,120
okay so if you look at all of the

1307
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,920
entries of a row instead of just summing

1308
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:30,320
them up directly Square them and sum

1309
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:33,000
them up you get you know the entry

1310
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:35,480
that's kind of twice as far down in the

1311
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,480
middle okay so see if you can prove that

1312
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:40,679
using a uh a double counting

1313
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:43,320
proof uh so that's all we have time for

1314
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:45,159
today um if you have any questions

1315
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:48,840
comments concerns please feel free to

1316
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:53,639
come up um otherwise good luck on the

1317
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:53,639
exam um yeah
