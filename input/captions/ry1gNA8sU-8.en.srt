1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,080
So our next speaker is professor will

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,759
Oliver. Will is a professor at MIT

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,080
electrical engineering and computer

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,679
science department. He's also professor

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,000
at MIT physics department. And Will has

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,439
been the faculty director for the MIT

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,279
center of quantum engineering since its

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,000
start in 2019. And since then he has

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,760
spearheaded MIT's efforts collaborating

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,880
with industry. So he's really the best

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,120
person who can provide us update on the

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,840
history, the current status and the

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,320
future outlook of quantum computing.

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,320
Over to you will

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,000
>> Yeah. So I'd love to continue that

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,399
discussion. Uh thank you very much Dana

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,760
and uh great to see you this morning. Uh

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,480
Will Oliver MIT and uh let's get to it.

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,480
So we're in what we call now the second

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,239
quantum revolution. The first one

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,879
happened a hundred years ago as you just

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,079
heard from Dana and that's when we first

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,840
realized that nature around us in fact

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,799
the world around us is fundamentally

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,040
quantum mechanical. Um and as I'll talk

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,360
about in a moment that led to several

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,840
very important uh technologies that

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,640
underpin our current well economic and

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,960
national security. Um but the quantum

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,960
wasn't really used in those devices um

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,119
at a fundamental level. This second

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,680
quantum revolution is now using the

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,880
quantum for purpose and that purpose is

34
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,280
sensing communication or networking uh

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,000
and computing. And so if we had to give

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,680
it a quick definition, quantum 2.0

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,479
utilizes quantum mechanics at a

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,400
fundamental level to sense, communicate,

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,400
process information in ways that are

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,159
just unobtainable by our conventional

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,920
means.

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,560
Now, when I think about quantum

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,079
computing in particular, I like to go

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,000
back and remember the history of

45
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,479
classical electronic computing. And I

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,960
will make it brief, but the main message

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,399
is that history doesn't repeat itself.

48
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,719
Certainly, it doesn't, but it often

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,799
rhymes. That's Mark Twain. Um, if we go

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,880
back to 1906, the vacuum tube was

51
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,600
invented, three- terminal device. It was

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,640
used initially for radio transceivers.

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,319
But 40 years later, we had ENIAC, one of

54
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,640
the first computers. Um, and it was

55
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,080
based on vacuum tubes. Of course, we're

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,680
not using vacuum tubes today. We're

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,720
using transistors. Those were invented

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,000
in 1947 at Bell Labs. 10 years later,

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,319
MIT had a computer called TX0 or Tixo

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
based on transistors. But it was

61
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,160
basically these devices soldered

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,680
together. To get closer to what we have

63
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,840
today, we needed the integrated circuit

64
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,319
in the late50s. But even with that, it

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,239
wasn't until the 70s that we saw chips

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,480
that you and I would recognize, I think,

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,680
as integrated circuits. This is the

68
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,760
Intel 404. Uh with Moors law, we

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,400
advanced and 25 years later, we had the

70
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,680
Pentium Pro. I remember using that one.

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,959
Um millions of transistors and that

72
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,360
still was 30 years ago from today. Today

73
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:01,680
we have wonderful machines, CPUs, TPUs,

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,599
XPUs. Um and the latest from Nvidia has

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,159
more than a 100red billion transistors

76
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,680
uh on the Blackwell. actually 200

77
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,360
billion transistors. So fantastic

78
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,760
achievement but look it took us 100

79
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,720
years to get here. Now quantum computing

80
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,599
in comparison is much uh more nent. In

81
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,760
the 80s people suggested if you want to

82
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,519
simulate a quantum system why don't we

83
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,080
use a quantum system to do that? Okay

84
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,280
that makes sense. Took us good 10 or 15

85
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,159
years to figure out what those

86
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,680
algorithms might look like. uh people

87
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,480
like Peter Shaw uh and his algorithm for

88
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,200
cryp analysis uh Eddie Farhey uh

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,200
Nishimuri from Japan and others started

90
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,480
to say okay look if and when we can

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,640
build this hardware there are some

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,040
important things we can do and that

93
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,799
turns out to be also 30 years ago and

94
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,280
here we are today starting to build

95
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,519
quantum computers we have them they're

96
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,319
just smallcale but the development is

97
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,360
accelerating and uh takeaway message

98
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,959
here is that look quantum computing is

99
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,000
It's transitioning from scientific

100
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,840
curiosity to technical reality. Um, but

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,400
we know that advancing from a

102
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,720
fundamental discovery

103
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,879
heroic, but but going from that point to

104
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,239
a useful machine is going to take time

105
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,239
and engineering. And that's the part

106
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,720
that rhymes with classical electronic

107
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,400
computing. Nonetheless, um, you need to

108
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,880
be in the game to play. And what I mean

109
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,280
by that is if you look at the Nvidia of

110
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,759
the world, TSMC's, etc., who are making

111
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,080
these very complex chips today. They

112
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,919
didn't jump in in 2015 once somebody

113
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,800
else figured out how to do it because

114
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,479
there's so much uh trade secrets IP

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
that's involved. This is part of the

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,919
reason that the PRC is finding it

117
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,759
challenging to stand up a

118
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,919
state-of-the-art fab and it will be the

119
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,479
same way with quantum.

120
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,639
Uh quick slide on cubits. Quantum bits

121
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,160
are the fundamental logic elements of

122
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,440
quantum computers and they come in

123
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,520
basically two flavors. One uh flavor is

124
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,639
the natural atoms that we have in our

125
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,720
periodic table. Um and one feature that

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,400
these atoms all have, they're obviously

127
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,800
very different, but they all have

128
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,120
electrons, protons, neutrons. And if you

129
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,280
look at the outermost shell, there will

130
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,120
be an electron there. And whether it's

131
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,600
in say the second shell or the third

132
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,120
shell, uh this can be construed as the

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
zero and one. That that's a bit

134
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,120
simplistic, but that's that's basically

135
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,960
what it is. And we tend to take elements

136
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,440
from these two columns although not

137
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,520
exclusively from there.

138
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,520
The other type that we have let's call

139
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,000
those natural atoms. The other type that

140
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,560
we have are electrical circuits that we

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,320
can design and manufacture uh in

142
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,479
fabrication facilities. And these um use

143
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,560
inductors, capacitors and something

144
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,960
called Josephson junctions arranged

145
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,880
together to form uh nonlinear

146
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,800
oscillators. Now when you take the

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,680
oscillator and you cool it down to very

148
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,680
low temperatures uh 10 20 millich

149
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,759
keelvin uh you can see that there are

150
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,919
discrete energy levels that appear here

151
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,639
as well. And now we're going to choose

152
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,960
the bottom one the first one to be our

153
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,039
zero and one of our cubits. Now this

154
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,440
this is a very simple example. You might

155
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,199
think of it as the hydrogen atom um or

156
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,880
hydrogen artificial atom. It's actually

157
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,440
called a transmon but we have a whole of

158
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,560
table of artificial atoms as well where

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,240
we've designed these for effect. Um and

160
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,639
and I'll leave it at that but these are

161
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,880
the two major categories. Quantum

162
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,600
technologies are based on natural atoms

163
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,759
or circuits that mimic those properties.

164
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,840
Now how is a quantum computer different?

165
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,080
Um I like to do a compare and contrast

166
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,479
with classical. So let's do that. Um

167
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,280
classical computers a bit of information

168
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,440
transistor for example. classical device

169
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,440
the current is on or the current is off

170
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,759
when it's on we call it one when it's

171
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,080
off we call it zero these are discrete

172
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,759
states and measurement is deterministic

173
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,240
and in fact transistors are almost

174
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,759
perfect um so if we set it in a one

175
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,560
we're going to measure it in a one set

176
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,400
it in zero we'll measure in zero quantum

177
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,960
computers on the other hand are built

178
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,199
from two-state systems that are quantum

179
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,280
mechanical we call them Qbits for

180
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,759
quantum bit and the way to think about

181
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,840
it is in terms of the planet earth and

182
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,880
Now, uh, if you're at the north pole on

183
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,720
the planet Earth, we're going to say

184
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,880
that's state zero. And if you're at the

185
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,720
south pole, that's state one. And those

186
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,639
are classical positions. A transistor

187
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,880
can only live at the north or the south

188
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,560
pole. And a cubit as well can be

189
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,759
classical. It can be at the north or the

190
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,280
south pole. But just like people, cubits

191
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,960
can be anywhere on the earth. And when

192
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,960
they're anywhere other than the north or

193
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,759
south pole, they're now in a quantum

194
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,919
mechanical superp position state of zero

195
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,080
and one, north and south pole

196
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,520
simultaneously. Now this is weird but

197
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,880
that's the what that's what quant

198
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,199
mechanics gives us. This is called

199
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,560
quantum superp position and one feature

200
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,639
of it is measurement becomes

201
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,039
probabilistic. So that if you're

202
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,560
standing on the equator you're equally

203
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,039
weighted 0 and one and you make a

204
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,120
measurement just like flipping a coin

205
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,080
you'll instantly snap to the north pole

206
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,560
and say hey will I'm state zero or go to

207
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,919
the south pole and say I'm state one.

208
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,919
And you could go to the same place on

209
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,199
the equator and do it again and it will

210
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,479
be completely random which one you get.

211
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,720
Might seem that it's hard to make a

212
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,879
computer out of this. Um uh and it is

213
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,960
indeed true that we need to encode

214
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,599
information in a fundamentally different

215
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,000
way. But we can do it. Now to give an

216
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,080
idea of the power of a quantum computer,

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,479
let's consider um let's consider this.

218
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,319
If you have n transistors, a number n,

219
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,280
you can form an exponentially large

220
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,039
number of states 2 to the nth power.

221
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,800
Let's take three that that I can I can

222
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,039
do in my head. Two to the third power is

223
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,800
eight. There are eight different ways I

224
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,479
can permute the zeros and ones. All the

225
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,680
transistors are zero. All of them are

226
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,599
one. Every permutation in between. If I

227
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,320
wanted to for some reason use each of

228
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,399
those inputs to calculate some out on a

229
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,760
classical computer I basically have two

230
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,680
choices. One is I can take one classical

231
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,320
computer and feed the inputs one at a

232
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,080
time and get the outputs 00 get the

233
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,160
output 001 get the output etc. Or I can

234
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,480
buy a really large number of computers

235
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,720
and try to do this in parallel. But

236
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,720
either way with an exponentially large

237
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,640
number of inputs I need either

238
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,120
exponential time or exponential

239
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,160
hardware. Now quantum computers

240
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,640
similarly n cubits can represent 2 to

241
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,399
the n classical states but they're

242
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,399
cubits so they can do a quantum

243
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,959
mechanical thing which is represent all

244
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,120
of them at the same time in a single

245
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,880
quantum superposition state and I won't

246
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,480
have time to talk about it today but

247
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,720
this leads to a quantum version of

248
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,800
parallelism and importantly quantum

249
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,959
interference and you can think of the

250
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,040
mass position state as being fed into

251
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,600
the quantum computer then a massive

252
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,760
superp position state comes out Now, we

253
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,680
haven't measured anything yet, but the

254
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,320
goal of the quantum computer algorithm

255
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,279
designer is to take this massive input

256
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,600
state with equally weighted answers and

257
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,839
then through the algorithm suppress all

258
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,440
of the wrong answers, leaving only the

259
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,959
correct answer by the end. So, when we

260
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,920
measure it, we get the correct answer.

261
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,279
That's basically how it works. So, to

262
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,519
take advantage of this, of course, we

263
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,800
need algorithms. And uh what I here at

264
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,120
the bottom are many of my colleagues

265
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,279
here at MIT who played an instrumental

266
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,880
role in developing these algorithms. I

267
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,800
won't read through this whole chart but

268
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,720
the left column shows the category of

269
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,959
algorithm and then we have the classical

270
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,360
time generally exponential in the size

271
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,839
of the problem n and then the quantum

272
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,760
time generally polomial in that which

273
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,839
means there was an exponential speed up.

274
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,399
So the one that we think will have the

275
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,640
broadest commercial uh advantage in the

276
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,440
nearer term is quantum simulation

277
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,320
simulating materials quantum chemistry

278
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,800
for example pharmaceutical development.

279
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,560
The second application would be one of

280
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,160
the originals, Peter Shor's factoring

281
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,320
algorithm, which attacks our current

282
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,920
public key crypto systems. We'll talk

283
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,600
later about switching over to a

284
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,680
different crypto system, but it's bas

285
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,920
basically because of this uh engineers

286
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,160
will recognize ax equals b that pervades

287
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,360
all of engineering and quantum computers

288
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,600
can sample solutions to large uh

289
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,560
matrices using quantum algorithms.

290
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,000
Optimization of course is ubiquitous and

291
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,680
whether there's an improvement or not

292
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,959
depends a lot on the problem that you

293
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,680
ask. Um do you need the answer like your

294
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,120
life depends on it or uh is a good

295
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,560
enough answer good enough? And depending

296
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,560
on how you answer that a quantum

297
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,880
computer will be more or less likely to

298
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,880
be useful and then search algorithms. Uh

299
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,560
this is over search algorithm and it's a

300
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,160
quadratic speed up. Okay. So so what

301
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,680
does it take to get commercial quantum

302
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,320
advantage? I think that's what we really

303
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,519
care about. And first off, there should

304
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,160
be no fast classical algorithm. If there

305
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,680
is, use the fantastic computers we

306
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,600
already have. Second is I need to know a

307
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,600
good quantum algorithm solves that

308
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
problem. There are many problems today

309
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,880
where I don't know how to do it on a

310
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,040
classical computer and I also have no

311
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,279
idea how to do it on a quantum computer.

312
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,600
And so you need to have a fast quantum

313
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,320
algorithm. And then third, ideally it

314
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
should be commercializable, useful. Um,

315
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,920
there are many algorithms that have

316
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,000
shown quantum advantage, but how to use

317
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,240
that for commercial advantage isn't yet

318
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,560
clear. And if we look at this overlap

319
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,200
today, it's still a fairly small region.

320
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,600
And and one call that I always make when

321
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,839
I give a talk is as a community, we need

322
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,240
to be developing more commercially

323
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,399
relevant quantum algorithms.

324
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,399
Now once you have an algorithm there are

325
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,800
two types of advantage and the advantage

326
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,519
is often construed as how long the time

327
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,680
to solution but it's also about the size

328
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,000
of the system the amount of energy it

329
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,040
will take to arrive at an answer maybe

330
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,160
other resources whichever one you prefer

331
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,800
they're to two terms a polomial in the

332
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,200
size of the problem n and an exponential

333
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,279
in the size of the problem n and quantum

334
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,880
computers can improve both so they can

335
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,800
either improve improve the prefactor

336
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,680
which we call a polomial improvement

337
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,079
that's where n goes to square root of n

338
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,320
that's Grover's algorithm for example or

339
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,399
you can reduce the exponential down to a

340
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,320
polomial that's called an exponential

341
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,399
improvement so if if the size of the

342
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,920
problem is upstairs bring it downstairs

343
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:09,120
and that is a tremendous uh improvement

344
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,519
uh in in these properties so that's

345
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,480
great um why don't we have them right

346
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,240
now and it comes down to two time scales

347
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,680
one is the coherence time and the other

348
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,680
is the gate time. So let's take them one

349
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,600
at a time. The coherence time is the

350
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,760
cubit's lifetime. How long does it

351
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,680
remain quantum mechanical? And so I can

352
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,519
my problem and I'm starting my algorithm

353
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,839
and as I'm taking steps towards the

354
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,600
final answer, the environment, you can

355
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,800
think of it as the wind blowing is

356
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,000
blowing me off course and and over time

357
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,800
my state of my system decays or blurs

358
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,600
and eventually is lost. Now the cubits

359
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,000
are still there generally speaking but

360
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,680
but where I ended up the answer I got is

361
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,760
the wrong answer because I was blown off

362
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,920
course. The time frame over which this

363
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,560
happens is called the lifetime or the

364
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,800
coherence time. The second is the gate

365
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,959
time. How quickly can I make steps? How

366
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,120
quickly can I run to the answer? And the

367
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,360
figure of merit here is the number of

368
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,920
gates you can do within the coherence

369
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,800
time you've got. Now the correlary to

370
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,560
that is long coherence times. That's

371
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,000
great, but it's not sufficient.

372
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,519
Technologies will have very very

373
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,839
different coherence times depending on

374
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,600
their technology, but it's really how

375
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,440
many gates can I do within that

376
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,519
coherence time. And when we think of it

377
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,880
in this way, we can compare different

378
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,639
modalities against one another. On the

379
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,440
vertical axis is number of operations

380
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,440
before an error. That is our metric that

381
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,160
we just talked about. And that's one to

382
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,959
one in what the community or the jargon

383
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,399
would be gate fidelity. So if I have one

384
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,839
error in a 100 that's 99%. One error in

385
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,199
a thousand my gate is better 99.9% etc.

386
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,240
And you want that to be as high as

387
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,399
possible. The horizontal axis is the

388
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,040
speed the clock speed basically how

389
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,560
quickly can I run my algorithm and of

390
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,040
course best performance is in the upper

391
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,800
right corner. Now some of the leading

392
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,560
technologies today are represented here.

393
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,560
For example trapped ions they're

394
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,000
relatively slow but their coherence

395
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,639
times are pretty good at least for the

396
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,959
single cubic gates. And so their goal

397
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,279
right now is let's get faster, let's get

398
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,800
higher cubit fidelity. Uh

399
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,120
superconducting cubits where I work,

400
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,279
we're relatively fast. Uh we'd like to

401
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,639
improve fidelity. Neutral atoms, you'll

402
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,560
hear about those in a moment. They're

403
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,320
somewhere in between. And there are

404
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,639
others like silicon quantum dots,

405
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,440
probably the closest to a transistor, NV

406
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,199
centers, nitrogen vacancy centers, etc.

407
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,800
many outstanding research efforts, but

408
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,880
in some sense you can see we're all

409
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,680
equally far from the upper right corner,

410
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,440
which is why we're still early uh in

411
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,000
this race.

412
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,639
Now, this is what commercial processors

413
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,800
look like today. Um in the lower left is

414
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,199
IBM's Osprey, more than 400

415
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,040
superconducting cubits, 3D integrated,

416
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,279
uh that uses technology that was

417
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,160
developed here at MIT. And in the upper

418
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,320
left is the willow processor.

419
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,160
Um that also 3D integrated but looking

420
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,920
down at the top we can't really see it.

421
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,839
These are both superconducting as is the

422
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,519
D-Wave system. In the lower right, which

423
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,519
is different type of quantum computing

424
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,160
called kneeling. In the upper right is

425
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,959
Quantinum's H1 processor which is a

426
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,199
trapped ion processor on an integrated

427
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,440
chip made of silicon. And in the middle

428
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,600
here is a Cera's Aquila processor. You

429
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,120
see a little dot of atoms in there and

430
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,279
we'll hear more about that in the next

431
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,959
talk. Now, in the lower bottom here, of

432
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,759
course, obviously this isn't a quantum

433
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,399
computer. Uh, this is the right flyer.

434
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,759
Um, it's often said, but it's not true

435
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,079
that it it's not the first time

436
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,360
humankind had flown. Just like these

437
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,720
demonstrations here are not the first

438
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,600
time we've ever done experiments with

439
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,680
quantum, but but I like this analogy

440
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,440
because um the right flyer is the first

441
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,839
time it all came together. There's a

442
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,519
person on board, self-propelled, took

443
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,160
off from the ground, flew for a

444
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,639
distance, landed again. and we see this

445
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,720
in hindsight say yes is the dawn of

446
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,040
commercial aviation none of us would get

447
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,279
on that plane um it's not mature enough

448
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,440
yet but but it is the dawn of commercial

449
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,240
aviation and I put it here because I

450
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,480
believe with these other processors

451
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,360
indicate similarly that we're at the

452
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,439
dawn of commercial quantum computing

453
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,000
we've demonstrated enough to show that

454
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,000
that's true in opinion and so going

455
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,679
forward we need to realize this promise

456
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,679
um and to do that we need to engineer

457
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,480
systems that are robust trust are

458
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,319
reproducible and extensible.

459
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,799
I'm running short on time so let me just

460
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,240
give this last slide um at a very high

461
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,240
level. I won't be able to talk through

462
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,240
the whole thing but the grand challenge

463
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,559
going forward is called quantum error

464
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,679
correction. We need to fix the errors

465
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,760
faster than they occur uh naturally due

466
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,559
to the environment. The physical cubits

467
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,640
we have today are up one in a 100 one in

468
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,320
10,000 error rates. But where we need to

469
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,160
be for practical applications is

470
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,480
something like one in a billion to one

471
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,240
in a trillion. Um, of course,

472
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,679
transistors are even better than that.

473
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,840
But we don't need to be that good. Need

474
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,960
to be in the blue. And the way that

475
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,799
we're going to do it is by forming teams

476
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,640
cubits. Rather than using just a

477
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,440
physical cubit by itself, we're going to

478
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,039
form a team. Nine yellow cubits. And

479
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,840
we're going to encode the information

480
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,160
across all nine. We call that a logical

481
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,840
cubit because it represents one cubit's

482
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,160
worth of information. but it's

483
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,240
distributed across nine. You'll also see

484
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,160
some blue cubits. Those blue cubs are

485
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,840
you can think of it as the referees and

486
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,679
they're going to raise a red card, a

487
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,760
yellow card. We have three errors and

488
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,320
maybe they have a blue card where that

489
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,440
tells us if their neighbors had an error

490
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,960
and go back and fix it. I apologize I

491
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,960
won't

492
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,960
explicit

493
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,880
it actually gets a little worse two

494
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:58,559
times worse two than a thousand go only

495
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,480
to 577 cubits my error rate has dropped

496
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,440
now to roughly 1 in a billion. So that's

497
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,720
an improvement of about 1 million. So So

498
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,039
I'll take that trade going from 1 to 577

499
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,320
to get a factor 1 million improvement.

500
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,720
That's what quantum error correction

501
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,400
shows and that's why it's important. Um

502
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,200
just to say Google for the first time

503
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,640
demonstrated this fact uh last fall

504
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,799
where they went from a size uh 17 to a

505
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,280
size 49 to a size 97. And each time they

506
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,280
did that, the error rate came down by a

507
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,520
factor of two. And in fact, it was

508
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,200
better than any individual on the team.

509
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,400
That's what we need to do if we're going

510
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,520
to realize uh the promise of quantum

511
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,880
computing. So, so just a few facts. Um

512
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,960
quantum computers are not going to

513
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,799
replace classical computers. First off,

514
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,880
we need classical computers to do the

515
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,640
error correction, but furthermore, we

516
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,320
need them to run the quantum computers.

517
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,919
We need to program. We type on a

518
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,919
classical computer and that program gets

519
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,160
implemented on a um on a quantum

520
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,679
computer. They will run in tandem. We

521
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,880
need more quantum algorithms. I already

522
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,720
said that. Let me say it again. Um on

523
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,480
the encryption side, quantum computers

524
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,080
are not going to break encryption today.

525
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,760
The quantum computers just aren't large

526
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,919
enough. We're going to need around 4

527
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,919
million cubits or more to do that for

528
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,160
today's encryption. But that doesn't

529
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,480
mean we should wait or be complacent. We

530
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,559
need to replace our current RSA type

531
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,799
encryption schemes with a new one that

532
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,200
was just released last year from NIST.

533
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,840
It's called Kyber or similar names. Um

534
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,919
we need to switch now so that the

535
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,400
information we're encoding now remains

536
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,480
secure not just today but in the future

537
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,039
when a quantum computer at a shore

538
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,240
capable scale becomes available and we

539
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,480
will almost certainly need error

540
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,919
correction to make this happen. Uh Donna

541
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,840
mentioned this but next steps if you'd

542
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,640
like to learn more um we have a series

543
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,760

553
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,039
Thank you, Will. And there's always so

554
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,320
much to talk about and time is always

555
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,320
too short. So, we are running out of

556
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,720
time, but there's one question in the

557
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,880
Q&A panel. If you can type in the

558
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,880
answer, that would be great.
