1
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,559
hi everyone thanks for having me my name

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,880
is ABI yadav uh co-founder and CEO of a

3
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,519
company called I customer uh at I

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,800
customer is a decision intelligence

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,640
company basically helping businessing

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,640
transform uh from raw customer data into

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:30,199
a modern GTM uh

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:33,360
engine um just to give you uh some

9
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:35,680
perspective on what we call go to market

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,480
which is GTM you know this has been

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,440
traditionally very creative heavy and

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,320
you know the creative engine has been

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,280
around forever since and kind of

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,120
distribution engine is what you know

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,520
kind of limited but in today's world of

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,239
modern marketing where everything

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,879
there's a signal there's a click there's

18
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,120
a situation like that there are multiple

19
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,800
engines are required to be done you know

20
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,440
some manuals some automation things like

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,680
that we sort of see this to be extremely

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,439
complicated in today's world while

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,119
maintaining customer experience while

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,000
maintaining privacy other effectivity

25
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:14,920
and not kind of bombing you know

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,119
messaging all the time and all all the

27
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:21,479
delivery of to

28
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,840
everyone so we see this inefficiency is

29
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,960
actually leading for every business for

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,560
about 10 20% of their revenue on

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,360
marketing which is kind of going blindly

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,520
and this this leads to up to about 2

33
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,079
trillion of like you know Money Paid uh

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,040
and primary reason is actually not an

35
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:43,240
effective marketing strategy is actually

36
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,280
the fragmented data chaos and how

37
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,040
businesses are currently trying to do

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,119
and this is where it is really stemming

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,200
in from is a kind of a self-service data

40
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,719
operation engine and a lot of Team have

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,360
like Center of Excellence a lot of data

42
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,640
scientists A lot of people but

43
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,320
ultimately there are still like

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,560
disconnected tools data teams any inside

45
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,719
um which leads to obviously a lot of

46
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,640
like inefficient uh

47
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:11,879
kpis we are taking an approach of

48
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,760
agentic AI which is basically U sit on

49
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:17,440
top of your customer data connected or

50
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,160
not and basically help you sort of

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,360
manage the data chaos at a speed in

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,599
which the data is getting generated the

53
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,640
insights can be kind of retri uh we

54
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,720
basically have three pillars um we call

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,680
it match decide activate you know match

56
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,840
is really an immutable ID system which

57
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,599
we have kind of built out with a lot of

58
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,080
Decades of experience and working on

59
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,400
consumer identity with privacy and

60
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,519
things like that and basically connect a

61
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,560
lot of tags and Signal which is all

62
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,640
around in the market today whether it's

63
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,920
e-commerce Business Online offline uh

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,319
and then help decide and then sort of

65
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,040
activate for um useful uh cases and this

66
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,519
is why we call it this as decision

67
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,799
intelligence more specifically uh we sit

68
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,080
on top of wherever the customer data is

69
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,159
we're we're composable platform with

70
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,599
composable we mean like we sit within a

71
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,959
cloud data warehouse or an non-pr data

72
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,760
set um with some sort of guardrail so

73
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,480
it's not like you know some crazy system

74
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,519
and then leads up to a lot of

75
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,680
application which are activation heavy

76
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,400
advertising martech I'll talk to you in

77
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,439
a moment we we we don't believe in like

78
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,799
AGI here because you know human

79
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,080
expertise is very critical especially in

80
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,760
marketing creative world so we look at

81
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,959
this uh aspect of human experti agent Ai

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,599
and customer data is what our definition

83
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,519
of decision intelligence is uh specific

84
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,360
use case customer life cycle automation

85
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,840
orchestration add targeting enablement

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,760
with in a in a way you know it is

87
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,400
individualized and not like done in a

88
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,799
spray and preway um lot of insights uh

89
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,599
where one can talk to your data most

90
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:06,640
more specifically um use case given our

91
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,760
system is very goal oriented uh this is

92
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,760
an example of a large e-commerce cpg

93
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,599
player where a business leader or an

94
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,840
operator without knowledge of a lot of

95
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:19,720
data data science and Technical jgan

96
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,440
would actually talk to their data not

97
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,759
just at about just finding answers but

98
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,120
also finding like root cause and then

99
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,160
sort of activate uh you know what could

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,120
be a corrective measure

101
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,680
so we're here in Japan um specifically I

102
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,280
