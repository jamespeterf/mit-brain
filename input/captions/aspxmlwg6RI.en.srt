1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,960
Welcome everyone. Welcome back. Um so uh

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,599
today we'll have a treat of you know

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,679
we're we're here in this um in this

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,360
colloquium uh where we've been at this

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,759
intersection between machine learning

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,920
and biomedical sciences really going

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,400
both ways. Um we'll actually be talking

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,800
more about applied mathematics and and

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,760
uh biomedical sciences and how to think

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,560
about foundations um in applied

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,199
mathematics in particular and topology.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,440
um and then really motivated by you know

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,520
particular biological questions and

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,920
really going both directions. So from

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,320
biology to foundations and then from the

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,160
foundations back to um biological

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,360
questions and so I'm very excited to

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,680
have Katherine Hess here um from EPFL.

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,239
Um so she got her PhD in algebraic

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,160
topology actually here at MIT. Um so um

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,199
and then held positions at the

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,160
University of Stockholm, NIS and Toronto

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,079
um before going to EPFL where she's now

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,040
professor of mathematics and life

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,439
sciences. Um so her research uh focuses

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,280
on um algebraic topology and its many

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,880
applications primarily in the life

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,280
sciences, a lot of neuroscience

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,560
applications um but then also some

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,720
applications in material sciences um and

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,119
she has for example developed um a lot

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,560
of topological data analysis methods um

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,640
that were used for high throughput

34
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,880
screening of nanoporos crystalline

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,880
materials as well as and I think we're

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,520
we'll hear uh probably a lot of that

37
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,280
today the classification of neuron

38
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,280
morphologies and also neur eneral uh

39
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,560
network

40
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,479
dynamics. Uh Katherine has been highly

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,920
recognized for her work. Uh she was

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,560
elected to the Swiss Academy of

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,799
Engineering Sciences, was named fellow

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,479
in the American Mathematical Society as

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,680
well as the Association for Women in

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,520
Mathematics, etc., etc. Um so I'm very

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,600
excited that Katherine is here as she's

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,360
enjoying her sbatical and um came to

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,280
visit us during that time. So I'm very

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,280
excited to have you here. So the floor

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,840
is all

52
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,840
yours. Thank you very much.

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,759
Thank you very much, Caroline. Thank you

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,280
for the invitation. Thank you to

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,280
everyone for being here. It's a great

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,440
pleasure to be here. I've really enjoyed

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,160
the time that I've spent at the Schmidt

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,000
Center so far. And I really look forward

59
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,160
to the coming days as well. Please feel

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,760
free to make appointments. Stop by. I'd

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,560
love to talk with people. That's what

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,480
I'm here for. Char recharging my uh

63
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,599
research batteries after four years of

64
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,200
being an administrator.

65
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:33,120
So I'm really eager to hear about your

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,440
ideas, what research you're doing, and

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,760
any ideas that my research inspires in

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,200
you. So today I'm going to talk about a

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,519
project that was led by uh one of my

70
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,080
former PhD students, Kelly Mags, and one

71
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,239
of my current PhD students, Marcus Ysef,

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,560
together with some people who are from

73
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,560
the life sciences at EPFL or life

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,599
sciences at the University of Loausanne

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,200
and now Heather Harrington for whom uh

76
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,599
Kelly is a posttock in Dresden at

77
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,159
NPI. And this is research that goes back

78
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,720
to the the roots of Kelly's thesis

79
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,200
project. So he was hired on an

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,040
international training grant from the

81
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,080
European Union which uh was all about uh

82
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,800
cancer biology and uh innovative methods

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,840
of doing cancer biology. And his

84
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,400
specific project was to think about how

85
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,680
the the menstrual cycle affects gene

86
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,879
expression. And so we're really looking

87
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,440
for topological tools for understanding

88
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,280
the cyclic behavior and gene expression.

89
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,799
And it really took until basically the

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,959
last year of his thesis to have the

91
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,319
right mathematical tools in place. And

92
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,799
so this what I'm going to be talking to

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,720
you about today is really this project.

94
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,280
What kind of mathematics goes into

95
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,200
understanding slick behavior of gene

96
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,799
expression? So what kind of challenges

97
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,480
are we talking about? So when he

98
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,760
actually when I first started thinking

99
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,120
about this kind of data, it was before

100
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,200
there were even single cells. We were

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,720
thinking just about ordinary RNA seek.

102
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,920
And now I'm going to be talking about

103
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,840
like what sort of problems can we tackle

104
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,680
in with related to single cell data that

105
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,560
we for which we can use tools from

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,159
topology and

107
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,280
geometry. So the first pro thing I want

108
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,079
to talk about is identifying cyclic

109
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,840
processes. So we're interested in

110
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,479
processes that are going to loop back

111
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,639
going back to homeostasis for example.

112
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,800
And so what are the steps that go into

113
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,720
our method for identifying such cyclic

114
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,880
processes? So we're going to use tools

115
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,280
from topology specifically something

116
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,639
called persistent coology which is a

117
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,240
tool from topological data

118
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,800
analysis and the pipeline we can develop

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,120
pipeline to detect and compute

120
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,639
statistically significant the

121
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,639
statistical significance sorry of

122
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,120
circular structure in such single cell

123
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,040
data. So we not just detect it but say

124
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,560
okay what is it really significant what

125
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,120
we're detecting there and how can we

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,080
justify it. So the tools we'll be using

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,680
are from topological data analysis. So

128
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,360
I'm going to explain these pictures

129
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,040
here, but basically we're going to have

130
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,160
a signature of the data that looks

131
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,639
something like this, which is called a

132
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,160
persistence diagram. And you see this

133
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,680
point here is pretty far from the

134
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,720
diagonal. And that turns out to give us

135
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,960
some notion of statistically significant

136
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,000
cyclic processes. And I'll explain in

137
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,919
more detail how that works.

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,919
The other type of problem we want to

139
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,680
study is okay once we've identified

140
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,600
these cyclic processes and we can say

141
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,600
sort of where in the process the

142
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,440
different cells are we'd like to see

143
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,680
something about which genes are actually

144
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,080
involved in these processes and in which

145
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,639
order are these genes activated through

146
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,160
gene cascades. So what we're going to do

147
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,160
is now use geometry, another kind of

148
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,360
mathematics to really analyze the

149
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,199
dynamics of the gene activity in these

150
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,880
cyclic processes. And we're going to

151
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,039
look at this by looking at the embedding

152
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,639
of this circular structure in trans

153
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,000
transcripttoic phase space. And so what

154
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,479
we'll end up with in the end is a

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
pipeline for estimating both cell and

156
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,440
gene phases from circular structure. So

157
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,639
we're going to have some sort of matrix

158
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,880
that's going to tell us about which

159
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,960
genes are leading which other genes. And

160
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,880
from that we'll be able to sort of see

161
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,720
the different phases and amplitudes of

162
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,440
the genes as we go through the cyclic

163
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,000
process. Be able to say oh gene I is

164
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,479
leading gene J which is leading gene K.

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,160
So that's the basic idea and I'll

166
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,800
explain in detail how we actually get

167
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,639
there. I'll provide some validation type

168
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,880
results on both synthetic data and

169
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,800
well-known cell cycle data and then look

170
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,199
at some experiments we've done with

171
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,400
different kinds of androgen receptor

172
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,319
silencing. So the philosophy that we

173
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,319
have is that if you look at the

174
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,960
epigenetic landscape, this is Wington's

175
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,680
famous epigenetic landscape that the

176
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,600
topology and geometry of this landscape

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,440
which is some sort of geometric object

178
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,080
actually has biological meaning. I don't

179
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,960
think that's very controversial. But how

180
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,319
do we go about measuring the topology in

181
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,240
geometry? Well, if we think about paths

182
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,919
in this landscape, we can think of this

183
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,880
as really corresponding to developmental

184
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,680
trajectories, right? As a cell evolves,

185
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,960
its gene expression evolves. And so you

186
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,280
can really think of that as some sort of

187
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,080
developmental trajectory. Now, in

188
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,039
particular, if we have a cell that

189
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,560
starts looping around in this landscape,

190
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,199
then that's really some sort of cyclic

191
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,280
process that we're seeing.

192
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,440
Now what turns out is that top

193
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,080
topological features of spaces. So

194
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,479
topology is about the essential shape of

195
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,800
a space not having the sort of scale

196
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,280
invariant and continuous deformation

197
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,120
invariant and that that gives us a sort

198
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,280
of stability to these features that we

199
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,199
detect and that provides us with

200
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,759
robustness for the signature we're

201
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,440
detecting in this way. And then we're

202
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,440
going to think of single cell data as

203
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,080
really providing us with a finite sample

204
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,280
of this landscape. we sort of figure out

205
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,639
where the cells are moving in this

206
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,960
landscape by looking at some sort of

207
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,520
finite

208
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,960
sample. Okay, so let's focus for a

209
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,479
moment on circular enrichment. We're

210
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,919
going to talk about the methods here and

211
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,160
then we'll see how to apply them

212
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,440
later.

213
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,319
So suppose we have some single cell

214
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,840
data. What do we do with it? Well, the

215
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,879
first thing we're going to do is define

216
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,879
find some sort of hallmark gene set. say

217
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,960
in the context of the particular problem

218
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,160
I'm considering which are likely to be

219
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,280
the genes that are important because

220
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,960
it's very hard to analyze genes in a

221
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,720
20,000 dimensional space we want to

222
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,319
restrict to something where we have a

223
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,720
greater chance of actually being able to

224
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,520
analyze the data in a reasonable way and

225
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,719
so we say okay if we're thinking about a

226
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,719
particular kind of problem then we

227
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,039
should restrict to maybe these 100 genes

228
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,200
or these 200 genes or something that

229
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,200
makes it easier for us to detect the the

230
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,880
circular structure we're looking for and

231
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,560
gives us some interpretability in the

232
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,080
bargain. From there, we're going to

233
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,519
simplify even further. We're going to

234
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,720
project onto the first K PCA

235
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,640
coordinates. Often in the calculations

236
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,160
we've done, K equals 5 turned out to be

237
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,360
a good answer. That's more of a

238
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,800
um not something that's mathematically

239
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,360
justified, but it's worked so far. It's

240
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,320
an engineering type

241
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,360
solution. And then from that, we'll

242
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,920
compute what's called the

243
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
one-dimensional persistent chromology of

244
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,040
this point cloud. So what we're getting

245
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,120
is a a bunch of points in some sort of

246
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,560
usually five-dimensional space. We like

247
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,160
to say what kind of structure are we

248
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,480
detecting there? We're going to use the

249
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,000
tools of persistent coology to detect

250
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,640
these circular structures. And I'll

251
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,279
explain

252
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,720
how. And then we have a way of

253
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,800
associating the of detecting whether or

254
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,200
not the circular structures that we've

255
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,360
noticed are actually relevant, actually

256
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,800
statistically significant by associating

257
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,800
to them some sort of score which is

258
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,800
called a ring score.

259
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,760
And then we can evaluate the statistical

260
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,279
significance of these ring scores

261
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,720
uh which will tell us something about

262
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,720
whether the circular structure we've

263
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,720
detected actually is meaningful and

264
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,880
worth evaluating from a biological point

265
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,880
of

266
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,600
view. So how do we get from point clouds

267
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,600
to what we need to use which are called

268
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,519
persistent diagrams. So we'll do an

269
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,120
example in in more detail in a moment.

270
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,720
But the basic idea is if we have a

271
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,680
collection of points in some

272
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,600
lowdimensional space. We if it's just a

273
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,600
collection of finite points, there's no

274
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,839
particular topology or geometry that

275
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,120
comes out. But we'd like to say well if

276
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,320
we have these collections of points

277
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,320
here, it looks like we have two circular

278
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,120
structures. Is there some rigorous way

279
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,880
we can say that? So using the tools of

280
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,360
persistent coalology or persistent

281
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,279
homology from topological data analysis,

282
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,360
it gives us a way of making rigorous the

283
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,399
argument that we have two circular

284
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,760
structures here. This idea of taking

285
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,959
little balls around each one of the

286
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,880
points and slowly growing the

287
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:44,320
radi sort of more complex geometric

288
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,600
structures arise. We see that once the

289
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,519
balls are big enough that we have two

290
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,279
holes in the center here which is giving

291
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,519
us circular structures and if it grows

292
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,920
even more then it all fills up. So what

293
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,839
we can do as the radi of the balls

294
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,399
increases is we can say okay at what

295
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,480
point does such a structure arise and at

296
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,839
what point does it disappear again. So

297
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,320
on the one hand we can compute what's

298
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,360
called the zero homology which is just

299
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,120
counting the the connected components or

300
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,720
we can look at the appearance and

301
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,920
disappearance of these sort of circular

302
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,000
structures which is what we call the

303
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,600
first

304
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,519
homology and then you can graph this

305
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,399
here by saying at what time at what

306
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,839
radius rather is this structure born?

307
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,480
What radius of these little balls is the

308
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,800
structure born and at what radius do

309
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,880
these things die? Does it all fill up?

310
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,519
And so we could plot points time of

311
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,880
birth time of death like this. And

312
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,640
looking at the distance from these

313
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,800
points to the diagonal here gives us

314
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,800
what's called the persistence of the

315
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,480
feature. So this particular feature here

316
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,880
corresponds to a persistence of one.

317
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,440
This feature here gives us a slightly

318
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,360
shorter persistence. So what we look at

319
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,279
is a difference between the death time

320
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,279
and the birth time. And what we're going

321
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,440
to do is as in this image here, we're

322
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,519
going to order the death and the birth

323
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,880
time from longest to shortest like this.

324
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,880
So we're going to go from a collection

325
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,800
of points by this method to now a

326
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,519
sequence of non-gative numbers like

327
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,720
this. And from this this sequence of

328
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,240
numbers will be able to tell us

329
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,200
something about the significance of the

330
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,760
features that we've detected

331
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,440
there.

332
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,959
Okay. So let's look at an example. So

333
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,519
here we have some collection of points

334
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,200
in the plane like this. And I'm going to

335
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,800
slowly grow these little balls that are

336
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,519
centered around each of these points. So

337
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,440
here we're supposeding the balls of

338
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,440
radius.3. We grow them a little more.5.

339
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,800
And we start to see different structures

340
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,399
emerging. There's a little circular

341
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,480
structure. The idea is that you're going

342
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,120
to add an edge between two points.

343
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,120
Anytime the two little balls intersect,

344
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,120
we grow the balls a little bit more. We

345
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,040
see this circular structure still here.

346
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,639
We see a hint of another circular

347
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,519
structure that seems to be on its way to

348
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,120
being developed. And we get to 0.9 and

349
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,560
all of a sudden you see this nice big

350
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,560
circle here. This is looks like some

351
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,639
sort of more significant circular

352
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,160
structure that's showing up. And we'll

353
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,519
say, okay, this is some sort of critical

354
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,680
threshold radius, critical radius for

355
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,839
these uh around these ball for these

356
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,440
little balls at which we see something

357
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,360
that seems to be a really important

358
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,399
feature that's coming up. What we want

359
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,040
to do is study this collection of points

360
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,920
and edges that we get this way that we

361
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,560
can study using the tools of algebraic

362
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,959
or combinatorial topology. If we

363
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,959
continue growing these balls like this,

364
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,560
then it starts filling up more and more

365
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,399
until at some point it's all filled up

366
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,880
and there's no more really interesting

367
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,399
topology in the

368
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,000
picture. So what are we going to do in

369
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,680
this case? We're going to go back to

370
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,040
this critical radius of 0.9 as we had

371
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,120
and we're going to find a way of

372
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,399
encoding this circular structure by

373
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,399
what's called a one co-chain. So if we

374
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,800
assign a real number value to each of

375
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,600
these edges here, we can assign a real

376
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,240
number value in a way that gives us u

377
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,240
just a function from the set of edges of

378
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,240
this structure. So we're looking here at

379
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,440
the collection of points and

380
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,760
edges coming from the intersections of

381
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,480
these little balls. And we want to

382
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,839
define a function from the set of edges

383
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,160
here to the real numbers. And so this is

384
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,560
actually this set of functions from ed

385
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,560
from the a set of functions from the set

386
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,199
of edges to the real numbers actually is

387
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,720
itself a real vector space. And we can

388
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,880
make a specific choice of an element

389
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,279
there that encodes this circular

390
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,600
structure. There actually infinitely

391
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,920
many equivalent ways of choosing this

392
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,760
encoding and in the end we'll find I

393
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,079
will provide you with a way of making a

394
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,079
specific good choice of a way of

395
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,760
encoding this structure by a particular

396
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,680
choice of a function from the edges to

397
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,279
the real

398
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,519
numbers and so this vector space here we

399
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,600
call the vector space of one co-chains

400
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:52,880
that's just the mathematical language we

401
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,959
use on this set of edges you have there.

402
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,959
So this is the a standard way of

403
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,600
encoding this kind of circular structure

404
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,040
that shows

405
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,279
up. And so now if we go back to our

406
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,199
persistent diagram where recall that we

407
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,399
looked at the the actual persistence we

408
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,920
look at the difference between the death

409
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,720
and the birth and we've ordered them

410
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,360
from largest to smallest.

411
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,160
Then what we can do is associate to a

412
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,760
sequence like that of

413
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,839
persistences of p a certain score where

414
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,480
we take this first persistence this

415
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,560
longest one and we subtract from it the

416
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,440
sum of the other persistences where we

417
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,199
divide the p1 by two p2 by four and so

418
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,800
on because somehow the shorter the

419
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,120
persistence the less significant it

420
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,079
should be somehow saying how important

421
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,000
is this feature that's picked up by this

422
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,000
zeroth persistence compared to the other

423
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,639
ones and that's what we'll call the ring

424
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,279
score where here we've chosen this n

425
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,320
just so that the values of this score

426
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,880
are always be um bounded between zero

427
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,480
and one and the idea being that the

428
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,399
greater this score is the more

429
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,160
significant the circular feature that's

430
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,920
detected by p 0 is and one nice thing

431
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,680
about defining it this way is that this

432
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,279
ring score is scale invariant so if you

433
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,560
have your collection of points and you

434
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,160
you know sort of you apply um a scale

435
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,120
change of scale so that everything gets

436
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,800
expanded like this the significance of

437
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,959
your fixed feature is not going to

438
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,639
change. You could also choose instead of

439
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,120
looking at death minus birth, you could

440
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,959
take DI divided by BI. That's another

441
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,560
looking at the what's called persistent

442
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,160
ratio is another interesting thing to

443
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,360
look at. But here we'll consider just

444
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,959
these differences

445
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,160
here. So using these ring scores can

446
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,720
tell us how significant the circular

447
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,240
feature that we've detected

448
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,040
is. So how are we going to determine its

449
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,320
statistical significance? So let's go

450
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,519
back to the case that we're really

451
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,720
interested in which has to do with

452
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,079
expression data for uh for different

453
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,120
genes. So suppose we've decided we're

454
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,120
going to focus on m genes and we have

455
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,759
some point cloud of expression data in

456
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,639
this m dimensional space for which we've

457
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,480
computed uh this persistent chromology.

458
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,320
We've detected a circular feature. We've

459
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,560
computed its ring score. You say okay

460
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,600
the ring score seems big but is it

461
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,240
really statistically

462
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,799
significant? And so what you can do is a

463
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,720
permutation test to come up with an

464
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,760
empirical p value to tell you how

465
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,959
significant this feature actually is. So

466
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,760
what we did was to we have this huge set

467
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,799
of 20,000 genes. We can take 2 to the 10

468
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,959
possible sets of m genes and do the same

469
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,039
analysis on these randomly chosen sets

470
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,280
of genes which then gives you a null

471
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,720
distribution of ring scores. Because it

472
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,080
could be that if you just make a random

473
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,600
choice of genes, you're also going to be

474
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,440
finding these circular structures. But

475
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,039
how sign, you know, so this will give

476
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,039
you a way of deciding when I've made

477
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,679
this specific choice of genes using my

478
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,320
hallmark gene set and whatever, am I

479
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,520
really getting something

480
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,600
significant? So then you can calculate

481
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,840
once you have your null distribution, an

482
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,840
empirical p value for your original ring

483
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,799
score and decide, okay, is this

484
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,799
significant or not?

485
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,960
So that's what we do in order to detect

486
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,400
the circular structure and be able to

487
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,640
say something about how significant it

488
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,200
is. So there we're looking in this space

489
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,919
where for each cell corres to each cell

490
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,520
we have a point in this space the

491
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,600
coordinates of which correspond to

492
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,080
genes.

493
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,400
Now what we want to think about is okay

494
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,120
once we've detected this structure what

495
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,679
actually is the process what cascade of

496
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,720
genes is leading to this circular

497
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,960
cyclical

498
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,200
process. So remember that when we have

499
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,559
one of these statistically significant

500
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,400
circular features that it's going to be

501
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,480
encoded by one of these one code chains

502
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,120
one of these fun fun functions from the

503
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:45,360
edges of the complex to the real

504
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:47,679
numbers. So what we want to do now is to

505
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,840
be able to assign phases to each of the

506
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,640
individual cells. Once we've made a

507
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,320
choice of what's called a harmonic

508
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,480
circular coordinate and that's going to

509
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,200
explain to you how we once we've made a

510
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,000
choice of this encoding alpha, we're

511
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,160
going to make a good choice so in some

512
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,880
sense a canonical good choice of a

513
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,400
circular

514
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,919
coordinate. And then once we've done

515
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,559
that, we're going to be able to now look

516
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,799
at the gene expression and figure out

517
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,400
which gene is weeding leading which gene

518
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,679
in the process and what the phase

519
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,840
differences between them and the

520
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,520
amplitude and so on. And for that we're

521
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,960
going to need more geometry. But to do

522
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,760
either one of these stages we need to

523
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,880
introduce some

524
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,559
geometry. So what is the story of

525
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,400
harmonic representatives? So just to

526
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,039
mention that the original work on such

527
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,280
things went back to work of Dilva Pike

528
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,720
and Park and Perea. So what we've what

529
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm describing here is a way of sort of

530
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,840
integrating and amplifying a bit the

531
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,919
work that they did. So recall that we

532
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,120
had at some particular threshold in this

533
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,120
process in our case it was 0.9 we had

534
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,360
this statistically significant circular

535
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,039
feature that appears. So we're there

536
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,760
right and so R is this critical

537
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,720
threshold at which this structure

538
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:01,039
appears. All right. So now what I'm

539
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,880
going to do to introduce geometry is to

540
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,320
introduce inner products because once we

541
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,960
have inner products I can talk about

542
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,919
angles. I can talk about distances. I

543
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,840
can talk about norms and things like

544
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:14,160
that. So what I can do is then choose

545
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,240
inner products on the spaces of

546
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,880
functions from the set of nodes to the

547
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,559
real numbers and on the set of edges to

548
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,080
the real numbers. So these are these one

549
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,520
code chains we already talked about and

550
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,880
these other ones are called zero code

551
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,799
chains. And there's a way of cleverly

552
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,120
choosing this inner product that

553
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,919
corrects for the fact that this cloud of

554
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,840
points has non-uniform density because

555
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,760
if your density of the of the cloud is

556
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,159
very unequal, then if you're a little

557
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,080
bit uh naive about how you choose your

558
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,080
inner product, you're not going to

559
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,080
you're it's not really taking into

560
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,320
account the geometry the natural

561
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,880
geometry of your space of points. So

562
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,200
there's a there's a um a way to do this

563
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,559
that takes this point cloud density into

564
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,960
account.

565
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,960
And then now you can define inner

566
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,400
products on these real vector spaces.

567
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,520
And once you have these inner products

568
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,280
we're in the world of

569
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,520
geometry. So once you have inner

570
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,480
products then there's a way of computing

571
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,400
a discrete lelassian on these vector

572
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,880
spaces. And when you have a discrete

573
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,720
lelassian then you can start taking

574
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,720
harmonics which are which are kernels of

575
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,320
the lelassian. So you can find a

576
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,799
unique representative in here a unique

577
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,360
one coycle. So map from the edges of

578
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:30,320
this uh collection of points and edges

579
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,480
to the real numbers that really is going

580
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,480
to encode your circular structure and

581
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:39,039
that you can extend in a certain way to

582
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,799
a map to the circle and there and um the

583
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,799
way to think about this is it really has

584
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,039
some map to the circle that is the

585
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,640
smoothest gradient with respect to it to

586
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,000
the inner products you've chosen. So I'm

587
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,679
not going to go into details about how

588
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,600
you do this, but just to say it is

589
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,760
possible to choose a circular coordinate

590
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,840
like

591
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,520
this. And then what you want to do once

592
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,000
you have that you can determine the

593
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,159
phases of the nodes of this complex VR

594
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,559
which correspond to your cells and show

595
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,760
you where in the circular process each

596
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:10,200
one of these cells actually was when the

597
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,280
single cell uh assay was

598
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,159
done. All right. So how does this work?

599
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,880
So we're now we're back in this here's

600
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,880
our critical threshold 0.9 where we had

601
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,640
this circular structure that appeared

602
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,039
and so now we've chosen we have our

603
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,880
circular coordinate this map theta h so

604
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,880
it's corresponding to our choice of

605
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,360
harmonic representative gives us a map

606
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,200
from here to here and this idea of

607
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,400
determining the phase of the cells is

608
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,799
using this map here so that we can now

609
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,679
use this to assign phases to the points

610
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,120
via this coordinate so if I have a blue

611
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,480
coordinate here I look at which points

612
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,240
were over that green there and so on. So

613
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,840
it's a way of assigning phases to the

614
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,400
points in the point cloud. Quite

615
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,880
straightforward once you have this theta

616
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,159
H. But we can do more. That's just, you

617
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,000
know, still in the world of what's going

618
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,000
on with the cells. We want to say what's

619
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,679
going on with the genes. How can we

620
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,280
figure out which gene is leading which

621
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,280
gene to figure out the gene

622
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,520
cascades. But before I do that, just

623
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,679
would mention what going on. the

624
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,240
difference between theta h and alpha h.

625
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,919
So theta h was giving us a way of

626
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,200
assigning a circular coordinate to the

627
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,960
different points. So here we're in the

628
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,440
space where each one of these is a cell

629
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:26,080
in the space where the coordinates are

630
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,240
actually genes. And then if you think

631
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,120
about what alpha h is doing, alpha h

632
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,600
assigns a real number to every edge in

633
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,679
this vr, right? And when you're

634
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,360
assigning a real number to an edge, you

635
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,440
can think of that like a vector field.

636
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,360
it's assigning a weight to uh a path in

637
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,440
some sense. So we have on the one hand a

638
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,880
coordinate on the other hand you're also

639
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,640
picking up this one-dimensional

640
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,080
structure and that's what's interesting.

641
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,720
You've got both the zero and the

642
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,400
onedimensional structure

643
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,720
here.

644
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,919
Okay, but on to figuring out which gene

645
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,440
needs which gene. So there's something

646
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,960
called lead lag analysis which was uh

647
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,799
for which we're basing this on the work

648
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,039
of Bishna Cafodal. Maybe they were the

649
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,200
first ones to do it. So the idea is

650
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,440
suppose that we have here in this toy

651
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,200
example we have two functions the blue

652
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,440
function and the orange function. The

653
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,120
blue function is sort of lagging behind

654
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,240
the orange one which is leading it. So

655
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,000
they're it's the same function but

656
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,799
they're just shifted from each other.

657
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,400
And if you plot uh for every x the if

658
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,840
you plot the pairs of coordinates sorry

659
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,320
as you go around it it translates into a

660
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,760
curve like this in the plane. So you can

661
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,320
go back and forth between these two

662
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,640
representations of the same information.

663
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,480
And so you're getting a closed curve

664
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,440
from these two curves that are following

665
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,679
each other. So you can think about this

666
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,840
as giving you some this pair of curves

667
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,320
here is giving you some function from

668
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,480
the circle S1 into in this case

669
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,000
R2. And under nice conditions which is

670
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,080
usually what's going to happen in the in

671
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,919
with real data you can actually extend

672
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,679
it over the entire disc. So you think of

673
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,520
the disk the boundary of which is a

674
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,559
circle. Then usually there's a way of

675
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,200
extending this over the entire

676
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:11,520
disc. Now what you how can you use this

677
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,120
interpretation in order to figure out

678
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,679
you know from this curve here for

679
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,360
example which of these curves was

680
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,720
leading the other that the orange one

681
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,200
was leading the blue one. How can we

682
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,200
detect

683
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,440
that? So here is our situation. we have

684
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,520
some map from a circle into Rn n n n n n

685
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,159
n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n

686
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,440
n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n equals 2

687
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,679
in this case extended over the disk. So

688
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,159
now we're going to look at this sort of

689
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,080
angular momentum vector field in the

690
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,600
plane determined by x i and

691
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,600
xj. And we think about our curve as

692
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,159
being embedded with respect to this

693
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,320
vector field. And if you think of the

694
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,159
integral around the boundary of the disk

695
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,080
which according to Stokes theorem is

696
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,640
just all you can also express in terms

697
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,159
of the integral over the whole disc then

698
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,320
it turns out that this signed

699
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:00,320
area of the the region in the plane that

700
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,720
is bounded by this curve actually

701
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,880
measures the extent to which gamma I is

702
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,880
leading gamma j. So I'm not going to go

703
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,120
into the mathematical explanation but

704
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,880
just to say that this computation is

705
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,120
helpful for finding out basically if

706
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,799
it's positive then I is leading J. If

707
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,720
it's negative J is leading I. Okay. So

708
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,400
you can use this basic idea. So this is

709
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,760
just about you know closed curves in the

710
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,919
plane. But now let's think about how we

711
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,960
can apply this

712
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:29,600
biologically. So now let's think about

713
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,320
again a periodic curve. So it's a a map

714
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:37,279
from S1 into Rn. And suppose that each

715
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:39,679
coordinate of this uh function so gamma

716
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:42,559
j is the j coordinate can be written as

717
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,880
a product of some aj times there's a

718
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,640
fixed periodic function from s1 into the

719
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,279
real

720
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:53,279
numbers that is just if I take some

721
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:55,919
complex value s zed on the circle and I

722
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,919
want to calculate gamma j of zed I have

723
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,919
some amplitude that's changing and I

724
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,480
have some phase shift that's coming from

725
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,640
bg but otherwise the the function is the

726
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,279
same the it's just the amplitude and the

727
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,799
phase shift that are varying. So that's

728
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,279
what what you would call a chain of

729
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,159
offsets in this case and often when

730
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,559
people think about a simple model or so

731
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,760
a naive model of gene cascades you can

732
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,000
think about it as being this kind of

733
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,679
chain of

734
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,720
offsets. Now usually a function like kai

735
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:27,200
will have some sort of forier expansion

736
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,600
that has many terms. If it has just one

737
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,480
term, it's just a real part of some of

738
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:36,480
this of a first forier mode. Then it

739
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,320
turns out that this um if you take if

740
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,120
you calculate this lead lag that we had

741
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,480
before, it's actually proportional to

742
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,480
the sign of the difference between the

743
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,240
phase

744
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,960
shifts. And so this whole if we take the

745
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,799
whole matrix of these lead lag, what

746
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,360
it's encoding is precisely these phase

747
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,200
offsets of the coordinates. So that's

748
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,880
the interest of calculating this this

749
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,559
matrix. It's going to give you what the

750
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,360
how these phase shifts are working with

751
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,200
respect to each

752
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,760
other.

753
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:11,360
Okay. So now we want to apply this in

754
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,720
the case of our V at our critical

755
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,039
threshold R 0.9 in our case. So now we

756
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,960
suppose we have our harmonic

757
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,720
representative our unique harmonic

758
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,679
representative of this circular

759
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,480
structure. So it's one of these uh one

760
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,720
code

761
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,200
chains and what we can do is we're going

762
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,360
to choose if you're thinking about this

763
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,080
this complex given by these points and

764
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,080
edges it can be really complex but one

765
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,159
thing we know as mathematicians is that

766
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,000
for a large enough n you can find a way

767
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,720
of taking this thing and embedding it

768
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,880
really embedding it not in the computer

769
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,480
science sense but the real sense that

770
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,720
we're it's only it's injective we can

771
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,360
embi Okay, embed this a finally in Rn

772
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,000
for large enough of

773
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:00,559
N. And then we're going to define a

774
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,080
function for every pair of numbers I and

775
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:08,320
J less than equal to N from the edges of

776
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,240
our VR, right, to the real numbers

777
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,679
that's defined as follows. It's it's a

778
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,039
basically an integral. So it's going to

779
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,919
send an edge of this complex VR to the

780
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,520
integral of this particular uh one form

781
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,279
we were looking at before this angular

782
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,880
velocity type one form that you see

783
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,320
again up here along the path in Rn

784
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,279
determined by the embedding of the edge.

785
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,600
So if I have an

786
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:33,600
edge in the in here and I look at this

787
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,840
embedding, it's going to embed it as

788
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,960
some path in Rn and I can integrate this

789
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,520
angular momentum form along that path

790
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,760
and I get a real number. So I have this

791
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,120
way of associating to every edge a real

792
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,279
number and that's exactly a one

793
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:54,360
co-chain, right? So it's given me a one

794
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,480
code chain in this way and I'm

795
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,320
using process. So I haven't yet used

796
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,360
alpha H. All I've used is this embedding

797
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,880
so far. How does alpha H come into the

798
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,279
story? All right. So I have my alpha H.

799
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,600
I have my FI embedding. And now I can

800
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,559
define a sort of a generalized lead lag

801
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,480
matrix as follows. I'm going to say the

802
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:19,520
J coordinate is given by taking the

803
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:22,000
inner product of alpha H and this one

804
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,159
co-chain because remember I defined an

805
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,960
inner product on the one co-chain. So on

806
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,200
this vector space of maps from the edges

807
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,440
into the real numbers and so here I have

808
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,880
a one code chain which is alpha h here I

809
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,120
have this one code chain that I just

810
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,840
defined by taking the integral along

811
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,159
these paths and so I it makes sense to

812
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,480
calculate this inner product and I get a

813
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,480
real number and this real number is

814
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:49,279
again telling me something about who is

815
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:51,919
leading whom. So if I what it's if I

816
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,840
think about what this is computing here

817
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,240
this is computing for every inj it's

818
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,520
computing the area of the parallelogram

819
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,159
that's determined by the so if I have an

820
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,399
edge from a vertex to a vertex and it's

821
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,120
mapped by this aphine embedding into Rn

822
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:09,520
each endpoint of the edge is mapped to a

823
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,120
to a vector in Rn if I look at the

824
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,600
parallelogram that's determined by those

825
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,919
two vectors what this computes is the

826
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,960
area of that parallelogram and So this

827
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:22,880
here is computing some sort of uh linear

828
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:26,240
combination of these uh signed areas of

829
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,399
parallelograms weighted by alpha h which

830
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,760
t taking the density into account as

831
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,679
well. So it's some sort of very

832
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,360
sophisticated version of what we saw

833
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:38,039
with the two dimensional

834
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:40,159
thing. Now this matrix here is sku

835
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:43,279
symmetric which means that we have

836
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,320
lovely ways of analyzing it finding its

837
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,120
complex values. the igen vectors and so

838
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,519
on and you can look for the largest igen

839
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,799
value at or the ones that have largest

840
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:57,919
real value. you can find the sort of

841
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:01,120
principal igon vectors and if you look

842
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,399
at the plane determined by the principal

843
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,919
igen vectors of this matrix that's going

844
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,080
to give you uh a nice plane and looking

845
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,760
at projections onto that plane can

846
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,320
actually give you a way of inferring the

847
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,720
ordering and the amplitude of the

848
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,640
different genes. So that's a whole

849
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,880
there's a bit more math to do in that

850
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,200
case but the basic idea is that we have

851
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,600
this really lovely sku symmetric matrix

852
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,440
which we can analyze by standard methods

853
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:32,320
from linear algebra and come up with

854
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,120
um appropriate vectors onto which we can

855
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,799
project and determine interesting

856
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,880
information about our

857
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:43,679
genes. Okay, so here's the basic idea.

858
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,159
We're looking at these lead lag uh

859
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,720
profiles for different pairs of genes.

860
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:52,480
It gives us our lead lag matrix like

861
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,440
this and from that we can determine the

862
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,679
principal lead lag plane like this onto

863
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,760
which we can project and then determine

864
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,080
from that what the components of the

865
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,480
different genes are along this path and

866
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,799
it tells us how we can order them as we

867
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:11,480
go around our cyclic process.

868
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:15,279
Okay, so that's the that's the basic

869
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:17,039
idea. So that's the math. Now it seems

870
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,559
like uh we've made a lot of assumptions

871
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,279
along the way assuming that we can use

872
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,279
this sort of lead lag analysis. And in

873
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,440
particular when I was saying we look we

874
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,039
can pick up the the the phase

875
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,600
differences and so on. I was making this

876
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,720
assumption that the dominant fora mode

877
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,559
by far was the first. Real life is of

878
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,600
course much more complex. Does this

879
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:40,159
actually work when you apply it to real

880
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:42,480
data? That's what we'll see next. So, a

881
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,480
bit of

882
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,840
validation. Okay.

883
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,440
So, first we're going to look at some

884
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,000
synthetic data, right? That's what one

885
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,440
always does

886
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,120
first. So, what kind of synthetic data

887
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,279
are we going to use? Well, we're going

888
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,760
to look at a linear OD model of genes

889
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:02,080
transcription and translation.

890
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,799
And in particular, so I'll just click

891
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,880
through here, we have a couple pair of

892
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,040
ODs where we're looking at the vectors

893
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,359
of mRNA and protein levels for different

894
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,879
genes. We have an interaction matrix

895
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,200
that's describing the effect of the

896
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,399
protein of the linear effect of the

897
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,560
protein on an RNA production etc. So the

898
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,760
typical sort of OD model that one would

899
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,440
have for thinking about gene

900
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,399
transcription. And then what we do is we

901
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,560
make a choice of this interaction matrix

902
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,639
that's going to force the existence of

903
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,960
cyclic structure. Okay. So we know it's

904
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,720
got to be there and we say can we detect

905
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,240
it? Can we detect it properly? Are we

906
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,960
going to get the right ordering of the

907
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,960
genes and so

908
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:47,280
on. Also in order to make it as a little

909
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,599
more realistic we're going to use the

910
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,320
negative binomial sampling that was

911
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,560
proposed last year in nature methods. So

912
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,639
it looks more like really noisy single

913
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,720
cell data. Okay. So it's not just going

914
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,640
to actually lie beautifully on a circle.

915
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,240
Okay. All right. So we do this. We did

916
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,240
it for a couple different examples. We

917
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,839
look at one example of synthetic data

918
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,160
where this was really the true the

919
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,160
underlying interaction matrix between

920
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,240
the different genes in terms of the

921
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,359
strength of their interactions. And then

922
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,720
this was the lead lag matrix that we

923
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:23,960
deduced from the methods that I was just

924
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:27,760
describing to you. So it matches quite

925
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:30,000
nicely. Okay. And then what about you

926
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,320
know having the circular enrichment of

927
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,960
the gene set that we're talking about.

928
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,760
So by choosing PCA components

929
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,640
appropriately we ended up with very nice

930
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,359
ring scores that were detecting actual

931
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,520
circular structures like this. Okay. In

932
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,359
the case where we're looking here at PC1

933
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,040
PC2. All right. And now if we do the

934
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,520
simplicity analysis with respect to the

935
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,400
genes now. So this is looking at here

936
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,160
they're plotting the lead lag matrix PCA

937
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,079
with its real value and its imaginary

938
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,160
value and we see a nice circular

939
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,440
structure coming up which then we can

940
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,839
translate into the individual genes and

941
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,440
see how they're plotted their what their

942
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,359
particular phases are and their

943
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,640
particular

944
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:15,320
amplitudes doing this kind of analysis

945
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,440
that I was talking about

946
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,359
before. That's just what it looks like.

947
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,280
And say, okay, does it work? Are we

948
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,160
picking up what we would expect to from

949
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,240
the synthetic data? And so here we're

950
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,320
plotting the gene index, which is really

951
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,839
the order of gene activation according

952
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,800
to the synthetic model against the phase

953
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,320
as detected by our method. And we see it

954
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,280
matches quite nicely correlation

955
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,560
coefficient

956
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,640
986. And then we say, okay, well, what

957
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,119
about the relation between the the

958
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,599
strength of the ground interactions and

959
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,200
the lead lag that we detected? Not too

960
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:53,040
bad. 642 the correlation coefficient. So

961
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,480
pretty happy with how well we could

962
00:36:53,040 --> 00:37:00,720
extract the the ground truth using this

963
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,880
method. Another example with another

964
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,800
interaction matrix, the corresponding

965
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,920
lead lag matrix that we deduced by our

966
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,480
method from this. And also here we see

967
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,520
here the correlation between the ground

968
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,680
truth of the interaction and the lead

969
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,680
lag was actually excellent in this

970
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,079
case. And they could do again this

971
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,480
cylicity analysis. Again we're looking

972
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,200
at the the genes now where we're looking

973
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,240
at the lead lag matrix with its real PCA

974
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,079
and imaginary PCA here and seeing again

975
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,480
the distribution of amplitudes and

976
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,680
phases of the different genes. And it

977
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,440
corresponds very well

978
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:41,119
to synthetic model. Again here we're

979
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,720
looking or plotting the gene index which

980
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,720
is saying the order in which the genes

981
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,240
are actually activated in this synthetic

982
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,119
data corres and then the corresponding

983
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,560
phase which is computed from the gene

984
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,320
expression data and we say again it

985
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,640
aligns very very nicely with a

986
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,839
coefficient of

987
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:02,160
0.998. And then we look at here we also

988
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,240
had a qu there is a time element when

989
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,240
you're looking at the these ODEs we

990
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,920
actually have ground truth time and

991
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,839
compare the ground truth time against

992
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,760
the estimated circular coordinate and

993
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,320
since it's being plotted like this you

994
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,599
really see the circle here coming around

995
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,400
and coming around like this so that the

996
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,680
circular structure maps very well with

997
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,240
the time component of this linear OD

998
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,240
model.

999
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,960
Okay, so that was nice validation with

1000
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,960
synthetic data. The other validation we

1001
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,760
did was with actual cell cycle data

1002
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,040
which is something that's extremely well

1003
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,599
understood. And so the data that we took

1004
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,800
was from from cycling human dermal

1005
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,400
fiberblasts from a paper by

1006
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,440
Capalupo. And the data set that we used

1007
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,040
was known markers of certain families of

1008
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,920
genes which are activated in the in the

1009
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,000
cell cycle.

1010
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,359
And so when we look at this, so here

1011
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,920
we're again we're looking at the the

1012
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:59,760
gene the cichlicity of the genes. So

1013
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,200
here saying something about the the

1014
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,359
counts of the different cells as you go

1015
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,880
around. And what you see here the the

1016
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,440
color scheme here is telling you about

1017
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,320
the activation of the genes. And you see

1018
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,960
that in this upper part of the cycle you

1019
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,720
have the S genes that are being

1020
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,480
activated. In the lower part you see the

1021
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:21,760
G2M. So this is for the biologist

1022
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,440
straightforward that this is the way it

1023
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,560
should be and it is indeed exactly what

1024
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:30,400
shows up when we apply this uh lead lag

1025
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,760
analysis to the um to the actual data

1026
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,359
from Capalupo's

1027
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:39,119
paper and again you can plot the where

1028
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,599
exactly the phase and the amplitude of

1029
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,480
these different genes are the S and the

1030
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,800
G2M here and the lead matrix which

1031
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,400
corresponds very well to what you see in

1032
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,560
real life with S activating G2M and so

1033
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,640
on. So it when we do this comparison

1034
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,480
with actual cell cycle data, you see

1035
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,320
that it it it you see what you would

1036
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,920
expect to see. So we didn't learn

1037
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,599
anything from this except that we seem

1038
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,640
to be picking things up

1039
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,240
properly. And another thing that can be

1040
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,839
interesting to look at is here there are

1041
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,760
five different sample genes that we've

1042
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,680
considered and the color scheme again is

1043
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,920
saying where are things being activated.

1044
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,599
Here we have the phase moving in this

1045
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,280
direction and you for those who know uh

1046
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,119
what these different genes mean and when

1047
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,119
you would expect to see them activated

1048
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,440
you can sort of see their activation

1049
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:31,280
moving around this cycle

1050
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,040
appropriately. Okay. So the and this so

1051
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,640
the the reason I'm showing this is

1052
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,480
because it's just to to illustrate the

1053
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,119
fact that this method enables you to say

1054
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,200
okay for a particular gene when is it

1055
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,440
actually being

1056
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,599
uh when is it actually being activated

1057
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,280
where do I see what is it its phase and

1058
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,800
so

1059
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,880
on

1060
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,320
okay

1061
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,920
so where things really get interesting

1062
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,680
is not when you're just doing validation

1063
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,839
and making sure the model actually is

1064
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,599
you know working appropriately but it's

1065
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,440
when it can tell you something new. And

1066
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,280
that's what I'd like to tell you now is

1067
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,839
some new things. In fact, some of it is

1068
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,760
so new that um I modified my slides

1069
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,040
after a conversation with Kelly this

1070
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:18,119
morning. So, there's some stuff that he

1071
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:20,800
finished up over the weekend. So,

1072
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:23,560
experiments, right? So, what I'm going

1073
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:27,319
to think about is a case where we're

1074
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:29,359
silencing the androgen receptors using

1075
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:30,720
viruses. And the first thing we wanted

1076
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,000
to do was to say, okay, well, at least

1077
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,440
in the control case, because we're going

1078
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,720
to do silencing on the one hand, then

1079
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,720
we're going to have a control case on

1080
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,839
the other. I'd like to see that at least

1081
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,839
in the control case that the the cell

1082
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:45,440
cycle data looks like that of capalupo

1083
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:47,839
because the the we're looking at

1084
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,520
different batches from different labs,

1085
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:50,960
different pre-processing, different

1086
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,960
everything, but there's both a cell

1087
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,280
cycle. Do we see the same kind of

1088
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,119
results? That's the first thing. And the

1089
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,520
second thing is okay, what is the

1090
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,599
impact of androgen receptor silencing on

1091
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,800
gene expression? This is the sort of

1092
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:06,720
question you like you want to go and you

1093
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,440
perturb something you say what breaks

1094
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,160
what doesn't break and to what extent

1095
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,040
and can we actually measure this and see

1096
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,560
this using these kinds of

1097
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,560
methods so the data we had was single

1098
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,200
cell RNA data seek again from human

1099
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,640
dermal fibroblasts and we're using two

1100
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:28,920
different lentiviruses they were to uh

1101
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,200
express AR silencing and also a

1102
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,800
control and then we're looking at two

1103
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,680
different hallmark gene sets or maybe

1104
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,760
even three. Uh one was from Velocycle

1105
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,599
and the other was uh something called

1106
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,040
SASP that has to do with

1107
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:46,480
scinessence. Okay. So what did we

1108
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,800
discover in this case? First of all, we

1109
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,000
looked at a comparison between just the

1110
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:56,319
cell cycle and here we were looking at

1111
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,079
uh actually both the control and the uh

1112
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:03,040
AR silence genes cells. And what you see

1113
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:06,079
is that when you compute the phases of

1114
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,160
the genes and their amplitudes, they

1115
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,480
correspond beautifully between the two

1116
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,079
different data sets. So one from the

1117
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,480
Capalupa paper I was talking about

1118
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:18,640
before and then this new set done in the

1119
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,119
lab of of Talo Doto. So a very nice

1120
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,200
correspondence there shows that this

1121
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,520
sort of topological or the geometric

1122
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,160
computation we've been doing actually is

1123
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,280
something that's stable across data sets

1124
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,000
pre-processing and so

1125
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:35,520
on.

1126
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,079
Okay. Right. So essentially identical

1127
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,880
phases and

1128
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:41,240
amplitudes despite the different

1129
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,319
experimental

1130
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:46,079
protocols. Okay. Now what about the

1131
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,000
existence of cyclic structures? So in

1132
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,280
the case here we're looking at this SASP

1133
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,839
gene set. We do the persistence diagram.

1134
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,839
We see a point that is far from the

1135
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,640
diagonal. How significant is it? So it

1136
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:00,400
corresponds to uh do this permutation

1137
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,240
test. So its ring score is somewhere out

1138
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,440
here which is very very far from the

1139
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,079
rest of the distribution. So this would

1140
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,160
be your null distribution. And you have

1141
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,480
a very nice p value. Say okay looks like

1142
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,839
I have uh a significant

1143
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,319
feature. And then you can say okay now I

1144
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,680
look at the gene clicity analysis. So

1145
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,920
here I would have the two different

1146
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,720
conditions the orange being the control

1147
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,160
condition the blue being the silenced

1148
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:26,079
condition. And what you see is that you

1149
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,599
get you know roughly a circular

1150
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:31,040
structure. It isn't as pretty as in the

1151
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:33,040
synthetic data of course but you do see

1152
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,440
basically a secular circular structure.

1153
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,079
And this is uh showing you for a couple

1154
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,079
of specific genes when they are actually

1155
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,079
activated.

1156
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,880
And what but one thing that is

1157
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,960
interesting so so far we haven't seen

1158
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,680
much of a difference between the genes

1159
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,680
the the AR silence case and the control

1160
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,760
case is that here there's a way of

1161
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,599
measuring what's called the AR silencing

1162
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:00,720
score. So this is a looking at the

1163
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:02,480
expression of the 200 most um highly

1164
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,560
expressed genes in the case of AR

1165
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,079
silencing and you see that there's a

1166
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,599
point in this cell cycle. So this is

1167
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,680
looking at sort of a three-dimensional

1168
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,680
version of what we were look had on the

1169
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:14,400
previous slide where we have the the

1170
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,560
lead lag PCA real and imaginary here and

1171
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,599
then we're looking at this AR silencing

1172
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,680
score and you see there's a very

1173
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,280
specific point in the cell cycle where

1174
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,680
all of a sudden these genes are really

1175
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,440
expressed and so one thought is are we

1176
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,520
moving into some sort of scinessence at

1177
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,920
this point that you're sort of moving

1178
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:31,920
out of the cell cycle when you reach

1179
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,680
this point is that what we're seeing as

1180
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,839
a phenomenon here so that's one

1181
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,720
hypothesis about what how to interpret

1182
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,880
this image that you have this moving

1183
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:42,400
away from the the cell cycle here. And

1184
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,359
we'll see that this is confirmed in a

1185
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,680
certain

1186
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:50,240
sense. So what we'd like to see is how

1187
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:53,200
stressed the cells are when they're in

1188
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:56,240
this AR silenced mode. So what we're

1189
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:59,440
looking at here are the looking at the

1190
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,920
entire data set, both controls and the

1191
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,440
uh androgen silenced androgen receptor

1192
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,119
silenced ones. And we're looking at the

1193
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,319
most highly variable genes and then

1194
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,480
projecting onto PC0

1195
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:14,480
PC1. And what we see is that here we

1196
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,319
have again orange is the control and

1197
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,160
blue is the AR silence that there are

1198
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,880
certain gene that are much much more

1199
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,640
highly expressed in the blue than in the

1200
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,960
red. And we see examples here that we

1201
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,040
have these four genes, three genes,

1202
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,960
sorry, that are particularly highly

1203
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,480
expressed these coming from this light

1204
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,440
color here in the cells that are AR

1205
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,280
silenced. So there's something very

1206
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:42,240
special going on with these genes in

1207
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:44,960
these androgen silenced uh cases.

1208
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,160
So if we look at that and say okay let's

1209
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,440
look at what's really going on with

1210
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,480
those genes and we take the we look at

1211
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,040
the some measure of the stress is being

1212
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,240
how highly expressed these particular

1213
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,760
genes are in these AR silence genes and

1214
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,000
we have the following picture. So what

1215
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,000
we what this is showing us here on the

1216
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,520
one hand we're looking at the cell cycle

1217
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,160
coordinates. So the cell cycle is moving

1218
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,720
along here from left to right. And on

1219
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:14,960
the on the y- axis here, I'm looking at

1220
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,680
the the uh extent of this stress that's

1221
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,359
coming from the AR

1222
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,040
silencing. And so we have the different

1223
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:23,599
phases that are measured here.

1224
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:27,560
Everything that's in blue is the G1,

1225
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:30,560
orange is this G2M, and green is this

1226
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:32,560
S. And so there, that's just showing me

1227
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,960
where I am in the phase. But if we look

1228
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,280
now again at this division between the

1229
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,760
orange being the AR silenced ones and

1230
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,400
the blue being the control, we see that

1231
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,160
for the orange ones, there's a kind of a

1232
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:47,920
threshold. When the AR silencing stress

1233
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,920
goes too high, they just don't enter the

1234
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,000
cell cycle.

1235
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,400
There are some that can enter the cell

1236
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,200
cycle that are more resilient where they

1237
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,880
have a stress level that's lower, but

1238
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,520
those that are above this threshold some

1239
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,040
somehow get

1240
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,720
stuck. And so what we have is that the

1241
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,520
cells that are expressing high levels of

1242
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,839
this sort of androgen receptor stress

1243
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,720
don't enter the cell cycle, but those

1244
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,079
that are lower seem to be able to. So

1245
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,000
there's some sort of degree of

1246
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,680
resilience to what's going It's a sort

1247
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,520
of a a phenotype that we're seeing

1248
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:23,240
expressed here in terms of how resilient

1249
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:25,599
they are to this andigen receptor

1250
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,200
stress. And then you can see that if you

1251
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,839
think about the ones that are the sort

1252
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:34,160
of AR resilient, the ones that do manage

1253
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:37,599
to enter the cell cycle, then they

1254
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:40,960
actually have a behave identically

1255
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:43,520
essentially to the non-signed cells in

1256
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,200
the cell cycle because you have

1257
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,440
practically perfect correspondence

1258
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,440
between the gene phases and the gene

1259
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,800
amplitudes in these two cases. So there

1260
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,119
seem to be these really two different

1261
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:57,200
phenotypes for these her human dermal

1262
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:59,280
fibroblasts. There are those that when

1263
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:01,040
faced with this androgen silencing,

1264
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,160
they're just blocked. They're stressed

1265
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,160
too much. And there are others that

1266
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,240
manage to get over it and continue in

1267
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,920
the cell

1268
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:11,599
cycle. One observation is that the ones

1269
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,640
that uh do seem to get blocked seem to

1270
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,480
be ones that are maybe becoming more

1271
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,079
similar to epithelial cells. And we'll

1272
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,400
see why this may be relevant in just a

1273
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,400
moment.

1274
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,880
So specifically now we're going to think

1275
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:28,480
about another case in which we have

1276
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,480
androgen receptors uh silencing well

1277
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,280
androgen silencing because we're going

1278
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,079
to think about a case where we actually

1279
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,240
going to castrate some poor

1280
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:40,480
mice and uh so all of a sudden there's

1281
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,920
no more androgen and see what happens.

1282
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,160
This is very different from using

1283
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,960
lentiviruses to silence androgen

1284
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,960
receptors, but we're going to the the

1285
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:51,839
results the same. So, we're looking at

1286
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,880
is data from a study of prosthetic

1287
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:57,839
epithelial cell regeneration from uh

1288
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,319
cart house in 2020 and we looked at 50

1289
00:49:57,839 --> 00:50:03,280
different hallmark gene sets. So, the

1290
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,720
process is this. you castrate the mice

1291
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:09,680
and then the the prostate involves and

1292
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,599
by 28 days there's reduced I think 90%

1293
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,480
or something like that. Then you add t

1294
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,160
testes back and it regenerates and at

1295
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,640
the end of 28 days is practically back

1296
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:21,040
to normal and then then what the what

1297
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,200
the researchers did was to take samples

1298
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,040
at different times throughout this cycle

1299
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,280
to see what was happening with the

1300
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:29,480
cells. So you really have this time

1301
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,240
element which is very explicit

1302
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,839
there. And so when you compare that to

1303
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,680
gene sets having to do with androgen

1304
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:38,400
response or even having to do with

1305
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:41,640
cholesterol homoasis or even others, you

1306
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,920
do get significant circular

1307
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,760
structure and you even get you know

1308
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,599
quite nice p values even for myiogenesis

1309
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:51,040
which has to do with muscle

1310
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:52,400
rehabilitation. So we get significant

1311
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,599
circular structure with respect to

1312
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,960
multiple hallmark gene

1313
00:50:54,599 --> 00:51:00,000
sets. And so you get the same kind of

1314
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:01,680
cyclic structure showing up in both for

1315
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,319
both the andigen receptor and the

1316
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,800
cholesterol homeostasis gene sets. And

1317
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,319
you can see the here the time points. So

1318
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,040
the different colors here correspond to

1319
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:13,760
different days in this process all the

1320
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,839
way from intact to the last day of

1321
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,440
castration which is the purple and then

1322
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,280
back to full halfway through the

1323
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,920
regeneration. So we have these nice

1324
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,040
circular

1325
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,720
structures. We can measure again the

1326
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,400
gene phase and amplitude. This gene for

1327
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,640
example is one that's highly known to be

1328
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,640
related to prostate for

1329
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:35,280
example. And then you see a similar kind

1330
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,960
of thresholding effect coming in. So if

1331
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,440
you look at this plot where we're

1332
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,720
plotting cell cycle versus tissue

1333
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:44,400
regeneration process in ter as two

1334
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,559
processes that can be ongoing in the

1335
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,079
cell. You see that in the case of the

1336
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,319
intact ones, some of them are here and

1337
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:53,119
some of them are here. And you go along

1338
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:55,040
and you when you get to the 28th day of

1339
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,079
castration, just before they get more

1340
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,680
testosterone, again, let's see right

1341
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,839
there. You see that they're all

1342
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,000
concentrated here. They get blocked.

1343
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:06,400
They can't enter the cell cycle. We're

1344
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,280
seeing the same kind of phenomenon here

1345
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,720
with uh inability to enter the cell

1346
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,160
cycle. And there are very very few that

1347
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,040
actually do enter the cell cycle. So

1348
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,280
there seems to be something about

1349
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,559
epithelial cells that makes it more

1350
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,440
difficult for them to uh or maybe it has

1351
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,200
something else to do with the

1352
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,599
experimental protocol I don't know but

1353
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,680
in any case in this case they don't seem

1354
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:29,200
to be able to enter the cell cycle when

1355
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:32,800
there don't have androgen.

1356
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:36,280
So conclusions from this first of all

1357
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,400
using topology and geometry we can

1358
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,920
detect significant these these

1359
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,720
significant circular structures which

1360
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,960
then enables us to determine phases of

1361
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:48,000
our individual cells and then we can

1362
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,040
infer these processes underlying the

1363
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,160
circular

1364
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,079
structures. Some advantages well the

1365
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,720
first one is not going to be kind of is

1366
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,920
will be kind of controversial here. We

1367
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,680
actually don't use any machine learning

1368
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,119
techniques, but maybe this the kind of

1369
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,599
output we're producing could be useful

1370
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:08,640
as input to different machine learning

1371
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,240
techniques. We've demonstrated that it's

1372
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:12,160
applicable over a wide range of

1373
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,240
experimental settings, different kinds

1374
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,720
of samples, different kinds of pro uh

1375
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:20,720
pre-processing, multiple gene sets and

1376
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:23,960
so on. And we're getting robust across

1377
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,839
gene sets across so on zero and

1378
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,720
onedimensional information. One

1379
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,880
dimensional information being

1380
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,720
information about processes. The zero

1381
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:34,280
dimensional information being more about

1382
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:37,640
expression of individual cells or and so

1383
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:39,760
on. Limitations because there are always

1384
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,040
limitations. there are hyperparameter

1385
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,400
choices that have to be made when we do

1386
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:46,960
the pre-processing for

1387
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:48,800
example which genes to study and the

1388
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,520
impact of outliers. So this is something

1389
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,800
that's still a serious problem can be a

1390
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:55,359
serious problem when one is applying

1391
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,280
tools from topological data analysis

1392
00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:00,800
although there are ways around this as

1393
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:02,440
well. Interesting future directions we'd

1394
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,880
like to

1395
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,400
consider. RNA velocity of course is

1396
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,800
something that people study a lot in the

1397
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,480
context of single cell data. We have

1398
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,200
preliminary data showing if you look at

1399
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,280
the spliced versus unsplaced for RNA

1400
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,200
then you you do see the sort of

1401
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,720
directionality you would expect from RNA

1402
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,079
velocity. I'd like to integrate the two

1403
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,800
together. I think that could be very

1404
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,000
powerful.

1405
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,520
One thing that's interest would be

1406
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,920
interesting to study is really get more

1407
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,559
deeply into concurrent biological

1408
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:33,000
processes because one thing we see we've

1409
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:36,280
already seen for example when looking at

1410
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:40,079
um comparing the

1411
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:42,079
uh androgen receptor cycle together with

1412
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,000
a cholesterol homeostasis cycle. You see

1413
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,839
these sort of things being they're wound

1414
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,800
together in some sort of interesting

1415
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:51,200
complex way. And also how does this uh

1416
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,280
how do you

1417
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,040
uh integrate together these sort of

1418
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,400
cyclic processes with more linear

1419
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:00,559
processes that are happening at the same

1420
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:03,280
time and more experimental data

1421
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:04,960
definitely want to go there. So with

1422
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,480
that I thank you very much for your

1423
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,400
attention and be very happy to answer

1424
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:14,359
any of your

1425
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:16,720
[Applause]

1426
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:19,200
questions. you very very much for a

1427
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,720
wonderful talk. Okay, questions. So

1428
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,599
maybe could you just go to the

1429
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:26,599
microphone and I will come here.

1430
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,599
Thanks.

1431
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:31,520
Thank you so much. That was a great

1432
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:34,319
talk. Um I had two questions about the

1433
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,839
lead lag analysis. The first is does it

1434
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:39,040
assume that the genes have very similar

1435
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:41,599
distributions? What if like the leading

1436
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:43,920
gene is expressed very differently than

1437
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,680
the lagging gene I guess? And then the

1438
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,680
second question is could you use it in a

1439
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,520
naive way where you don't previously

1440
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:52,319
define a gene set and you just kind of

1441
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,720
ask over the whole data set which genes

1442
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,839
might be leading

1443
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,839
others. So those are both really good

1444
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:59,280
questions. I think that yes implicitly

1445
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,839
for the time being we're assuming the

1446
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,160
distributions are very similar. Clearly

1447
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:07,040
I mean this is a so far it's I would say

1448
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:10,240
fairly naive and it'd be really nice to

1449
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,680
to make it uh a more careful analysis. I

1450
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:13,200
think it'd be a very good idea. That's a

1451
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,160
really good question.

1452
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,680
And um as far as I know, we haven't

1453
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,200
thought about what happens if you don't

1454
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:23,400
have any prior knowledge of what genes

1455
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:25,920
are there. But I think it could

1456
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,359
be could be interesting to to see

1457
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,880
whether whether there's a way of going

1458
00:56:27,359 --> 00:56:32,480
about it in sort of um I mean this would

1459
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,960
appeal actually to a topologist not to

1460
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,640
have to choose coordinates, right? To be

1461
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,839
able to pick out the sort of structures

1462
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,119
without having predetermined the

1463
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:42,680
coordinates. That's a really interesting

1464
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,680
idea. Thanks.

1465
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,400
Hey. Um, yeah, thanks for the great

1466
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:48,000
talk. Thank you. Uh, so yeah, persistent

1467
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,319
homology is like a great technique for

1468
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
detecting circular structure. Uh, but

1469
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,680
when I've when the few times I've looked

1470
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
at like single cell RNA seek data for

1471
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,520
like developmental trajectories,

1472
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,559
then rather than having a circular

1473
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,079
structure like you would have for like

1474
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,760
cell cycle or like menstrual cycle like

1475
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,280
you mentioned in the beginning, you end

1476
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,440
up with like a kind of like branching

1477
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,599
structure. So from a topological

1478
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,720
perspective, that's a point, right? But

1479
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:11,520
it seems like there's kind of similar

1480
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,359
methods that should be helpful for like

1481
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,960
still kind of like uncovering that

1482
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:16,559
branching structure. So I'm wondering if

1483
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,839
you have any thoughts on that. No,

1484
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,760
that's a really good question and I

1485
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:21,440
agree that uh and then this is one thing

1486
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,280
that uh that Kelly is giving a lot of

1487
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,599
thought to like what can you do to

1488
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,480
integrate more linear structures with

1489
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:31,119
cyclic structures and I think that one

1490
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,559
thing I mean clearly the what I was

1491
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:34,480
thinking about the lead lag analysis

1492
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,559
that doesn't require us actually to have

1493
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,240
an underlying circular structure. So I

1494
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,319
think one should be able to take that

1495
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,599
part of the story because you no longer

1496
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:45,680
no longer worried about you know

1497
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:48,079
detecting uh circular structure and then

1498
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:50,160
be able to say something about in within

1499
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:51,920
a developmental process which gene is

1500
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,599
leading which other gene. I think that

1501
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,079
should be possible to extend to that

1502
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:58,799
class. Cool. Thank you. You're welcome.

1503
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:00,240
This is maybe a slightly different

1504
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:02,799
version of the first question but

1505
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,799
hopefully it's different enough. uh I

1506
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:06,480
have you know in a previous life done

1507
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,079
some work on like nonlinear coupled

1508
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,319
oscillators and things like this and so

1509
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,799
this last story here where you're

1510
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:15,280
looking at the cell cycle and then also

1511
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:17,599
this regeneration cycle it seemed like

1512
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,280
so uh at the outset of each one you

1513
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:23,200
subset down to genes that you think were

1514
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,960
important um but if you were to let's

1515
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:28,160
say take the union of this these gene

1516
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:30,400
sets and presumably you would would do

1517
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,960
you believe that you would find you know

1518
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:37,280
a a a second order loop for example. And

1519
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:39,040
my question really is um when you have

1520
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,440
what you have here is a highly nonlinear

1521
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,359
relationship between the cell cycle and

1522
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,640
the regeneration cycle or one is

1523
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:49,440
actually gating the other. Yeah. Um and

1524
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:51,839
you have genes that are probably going

1525
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,520
to be in common between the two of them.

1526
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:56,920
And I'm wondering if you have any

1527
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:59,680
thoughts on how you think the um the

1528
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,920
phase estimation would go if you had

1529
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:03,440
these if you had sort of two linked

1530
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,880
cycles that have a nonlinear

1531
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,160
relationship rather than the linear

1532
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,599
relationship which you had when you were

1533
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,280
doing your validation which is easy

1534
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,640
because they you it's linear and it's

1535
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,040
all sort of sorts itself out.

1536
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:15,040
Absolutely. Absolutely. So I think that

1537
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,280
I think there's potential to work these

1538
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,680
things out. I think the math is not

1539
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,200
going to be

1540
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:24,319
easy but I think that it's worth doing.

1541
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,920
I think that uh I mean even you know

1542
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:27,760
moving beyond okay thinking about all

1543
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,760
right the the first fury your face is

1544
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,160
dominant and being able to ignore ignore

1545
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,359
the rest I think that's a little bit too

1546
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,839
naive and and being able to say you know

1547
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:40,480
slowly slowly build in more of these

1548
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:41,920
complexities now I and this is something

1549
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,400
that that Kelly and I definitely agree

1550
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,440
on that the really important thing

1551
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,599
what's going to be really interesting

1552
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,319
and this is a long-term project is to

1553
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:53,040
think about inter interwoven phasing

1554
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:55,119
interwoven processes and uh

1555
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:57,359
understanding really how one impacts the

1556
00:59:55,119 --> 01:00:00,000
other in terms of uh phase estimations

1557
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:01,359
and so on. It's not going to be trivial.

1558
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,200
It's going to be really interesting but

1559
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:06,000
it's not going to be trivial but it's a

1560
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,000
because it's a really good

1561
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:10,319
question and I don't know the answer

1562
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,880
yet.

1563
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,319
Thanks as well for a great talk. Um, so

1564
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,160
you had some really nice visualizations

1565
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:18,000
and so I have them in my mind. And so my

1566
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,480
question is if you're I guess you're in

1567
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,040
5D, I can't do that, but let's say 3D.

1568
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:26,000
Um, if I had 3D data that's going along

1569
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,680
like a corkcrew on a tube, uh, what

1570
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,359
would your method say about that? And

1571
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,520
then if that instead kind of collapsed

1572
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,040
kind of like a like into a cone and they

1573
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,480
went to a point, what would your what

1574
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,119
would your methods would would they find

1575
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,960
cycles sometimes? What would we see? So

1576
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:41,760
I think that if it would actually you

1577
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:43,319
know go down to a point probably we

1578
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:47,119
wouldn't get a significant cyclic

1579
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:52,720
structure. Um but because it really you

1580
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:52,720
know you it's an interesting question.

1581
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,359
Um yeah because I yeah because the

1582
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,799
topology would would sort of start

1583
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:01,760
seeing this as a point but I think that

1584
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:03,440
if it's a corkcrew that doesn't actually

1585
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,720
converge to a point I think then you

1586
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,920
would definitely pick up a cyclic

1587
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,960
structure right because you're looking

1588
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,640
for this S1 parameterization so as long

1589
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,359
as you have that and I guess is that

1590
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:15,440
like an average across the depth of the

1591
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,960
hole and so whatever Yeah I think that

1592
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,079
would that's that's a good question I'd

1593
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,760
have to think I'd have to think more

1594
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:22,160
about that but I would I would think so.

1595
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,559
Yeah. Can I ask another question? Sure.

1596
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,079
Okay. So, you you simulated uh in the

1597
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,400
your first example, you had a simulated

1598
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:30,799
like uh OD and then you tried to recover

1599
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,480
some structure about it. Um have you

1600
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:33,920
thought about a lot of times I I

1601
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,839
wouldn't be surprised if that OD's

1602
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,200
parameters are pretty hard to recover

1603
01:01:35,839 --> 01:01:38,559
from the data you generate. There there

1604
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,480
are ways to do it, but I wouldn't be

1605
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,640
surprised if it's hard. Yeah. Um, I'm

1606
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,280
curious a if you've tried that, but also

1607
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:47,920
b after you do this analysis, do you

1608
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,240
think it tells you what kinds of

1609
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,000
generating dynamical systems or what

1610
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,040
kinds of properties those things have?

1611
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,960
In other words, like if we're trying to

1612
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,400
do system ID, we'd love to have a

1613
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,480
generating model that looks like

1614
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,880
physics. Um, could these kinds of

1615
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,559
approaches tell us which models we

1616
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,240
should be designing and things like that

1617
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:07,680
or properties of them?

1618
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:10,720
So um to to the second question I think

1619
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,920
that there's potential there for sure I

1620
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,680
think that could be really helpful

1621
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,280
provide an interesting perspective maybe

1622
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,440
not everything but it could provide some

1623
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,359
interesting information and then

1624
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,040
recovering all the parameters I don't

1625
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:23,119
know because I mean at least it seems we

1626
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,359
can recover as I said the amplitudes and

1627
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,920
the phase shifts uh recover everything

1628
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:31,240
I'm not sure but uh at least that part

1629
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,240
of the story

1630
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:38,079
what is known about how PCA interacts

1631
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:39,599
with persistent coology because at the

1632
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,520
beginning you're going down to I mean

1633
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:43,599
okay one is gene set analysis and then

1634
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:46,400
but then you're doing PCA so how robust

1635
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:49,440
is this? So that's a that's an excellent

1636
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:52,400
question. I don't know the answer. Um so

1637
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:56,079
I think that uh for the time being in

1638
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:58,480
terms of robustness we've uh you know

1639
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:00,880
seeing actually the sort of same cyclic

1640
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:02,880
structure showing up in different data

1641
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,440
sets seems to indicate that okay what

1642
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,119
we're doing is not

1643
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:08,960
unreasonable. Now as a mathematician I

1644
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,799
would love to have a proof that it

1645
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,720
actually is not unreasonable. I don't

1646
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:15,599
know maybe somebody like uh like Jose

1647
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,200
Pereah might know the the extent to

1648
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:20,280
which this is stable under doing these

1649
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:24,720
sort of PCA projections. I don't

1650
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:26,760
um but uh real life experience seems to

1651
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:28,880
show that it's not a bad

1652
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:33,480
idea. I've learned something about being

1653
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:33,480
an engineer since I started doing this.

1654
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:38,799
Okay, other

1655
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:40,250
questions. Oh, great. So, thank you so

1656
01:03:38,799 --> 01:03:46,579
much again for

1657
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:46,579
[Applause]
