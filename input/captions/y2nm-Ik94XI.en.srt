1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,279
Uh so it's my my great pleasure to uh

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,760
introduce the second keynote speaker of

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,360
today uh Robert Plenge who is the

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,480
executive vice president and chief

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,320
research officer at Bristol Myers Squib.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,720
He came to Bristol my script from

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,119
Seljian that was acquired by BMS and

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,320
before that he was head of translational

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,920
medicine and vice president at Merc. uh

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,080
he began his journey in academic

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,320
medicine training for his MD and PhD on

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,239
the west coast at UCSF and UCSD and then

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,559
he came to the east coast to do a

14
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,320
fellowship in clinical rheumatology and

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,640
he liked the climate so much that he

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,800
ended up staying here I guess uh and

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
this is also of course uh both clinical

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,200
rheumatology and genetics of course and

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,559
not just at the at B at the Bighamin

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,480
Women's Hospital but at the broad

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,239
institute as well so I think your mentor

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,760
here was David Alill is that correct I

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,079
couldn't quite remember that piece and

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,440
he also has uh brought brought this

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,039
unique voice to our community through

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,280
his blog that I really recommend that

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,640
you guys read called Plench Gen. If you

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,399
hadn't read it, if you haven't read it

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,879
already, it's about uh impact in

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,560
genetics and medicine uh and really has

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,240
some interesting thoughts about how we

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,080
should approach drug development uh

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,520
through uh those types of approaches.

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,960
And I know that this is also what his

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,960
presentation will be about. And a fun

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,680
fact which for those of you who know me,

37
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,960
I love fun facts. Uh I actually was had

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,439
the good fortune of interacting with

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,280
Robert when he was at the broad and he

40
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,119
when he transitioned to Merc gave me an

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,200
opportunity to get my first industry

42
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,600
collaboration and grant that actually

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,840
launched my lab. It was my second grant

44
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,520
ever I think around 2012 or 13 and it

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,520
was a real gamecher for me and I don't

46
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,880
think I ever told you that but uh it was

47
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,119
really great interacting with your team

48
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,640
at Merc and uh the funding was

49
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,159
fantastic. We actually did some really

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,759
good work with with that money. So, it's

51
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,759
just an enormous pleasure to welcome you

52
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,200
back. I've been excited to hear your

53
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,240
talk and I love the title. So, can't

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,240
wait to see what you're going to tell

55
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,240
us.

56
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,560
I I I did not know that. So, so thank

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,799
you and I'm glad we were able to help.

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,040
So, um first of all, thanks for inviting

59
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,200
me and uh for all of you who are still

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,679
here, thanks for uh hanging in there. I

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,959
know it's been a been a long day. Um, so

62
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,800
I'm I'm going to start in the same way

63
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,040
that uh Ben actually started, which is

64
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,560
to thank a number of people who actually

65
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,239
contributed to the talk. So Joe

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,599
Moranville, who's part of Bristol Myers

67
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,840
Squib I've worked with for a number of

68
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,920
years. He contributed a lot of the the

69
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,440
data that I'll show you today. We had a

70
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,800
great pleasure to work with a company

71
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,200
called Octant. Uh Shri Kosuri uh was a

72
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,319
posttock with uh with George Church. So

73
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,760
kind of starting in the beginning and

74
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,080
the end of the day and they did a lot of

75
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,360
the work on on saturation mutagenesis

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,040
that I'll show you at the end of the

77
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,480
talk. Uh and then lastly, I'm going to

78
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,560
give you a number of examples that have

79
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,200
come out of our Bristol Myers pipeline.

80
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,120
Um I have worked on the minority of them

81
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,040
until recently. So there are a lot of

82
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,560
people who have worked on these programs

83
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,560
uh for a decade or more. And I'll be

84
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,879
able to share some of the examples uh

85
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,000
with you today. Um so this is a talk I

86
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,760
haven't given before. So you're going to

87
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,319
have to tell me if this concept of a

88
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,840
billion dollar bet actually works. I'm

89
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,680
going to start in the way that Molina

90
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,560
actually started the day as well uh

91
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,560
which is to frame the concept of some of

92
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,360
the challenges that we fra face in drug

93
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,000
discovery and development which is we

94
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,560
take we spent all of this time doing

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,120
what what what VJ talked about in MSI 2

96
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,800
and trying to understand the genetics

97
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,640
and the functions of a particular

98
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,800
protein and we do it in animal models.

99
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,200
We make molecules. We take them into

100
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,879
human clinical trials and the vast

101
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,519
majority of those things just fail and

102
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,560
they fail because the drugs don't don't

103
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,239
work. Somehow we pick the wrong target.

104
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,159
So what you can actually see on the left

105
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,640
hand side of this graph is is that

106
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,640
simple pie chart of why most drugs fail.

107
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,760
Most drugs fail because the drugs don't

108
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,920
work despite many many years of hard

109
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,159
work leading up to making the medicine

110
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,440
and testing it in in humans. And I think

111
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,680
on the right hand side, this sort of

112
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,959
frames at a high high level uh one of

113
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
the reasons that drugs don't work

114
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,120
because we just don't have enough

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,360
insight into human biology to make all

116
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,319
of the right choices that are required

117
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,599
to identify a target, make a molecule,

118
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,599
take it into the right patient

119
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,239
population, test it, and to see this

120
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,319
PKPD relationship, and ultimately get a

121
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,439
drug approved. So hopefully as we can

122
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,759
focus more and more not just on human

123
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,880
model systems but causal human model

124
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,240
systems, we'll begin to improve uh the

125
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,759
rates of efficacy in clinical trials. Um

126
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,680
so I think we've heard about this a

127
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,360
bunch already today and I think I'm sure

128
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,440
you're all very familiar with this is

129
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,120
that human genetics is a very powerful

130
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,840
tool uh to help predict the success of a

131
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,479
drug target in clinical trials. So Matt

132
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,440
Nelson um had a paper a number of years

133
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,960
ago. Eric Minl expanded on this a couple

134
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,759
of years ago. And basically the

135
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,919
take-home here is if a drug if a drug is

136
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,080
against a validated genetic target, it's

137
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,639
at least a two to threefold increased

138
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,639
likelihood of probability of success in

139
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,479
clinical development. Um we've done some

140
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,080
work on this. Uh Joe Moranville and his

141
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,400
team have done some work on this uh

142
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,840
within within BMS. And one thing in

143
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,440
particular is we've added on this kind

144
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,120
of proteomr

145
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,000
approach which if you can actually have

146
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,000
proteomic data link with genetic data

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
that's also a good predictor of of drug

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,199
success. But as I go through the talk

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,720
one of the things that I really want to

150
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,120
emphasize is yes genetics is a powerful

151
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,280
predictor of success for drugs. But

152
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,039
there are properties of human genetics

153
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,520
which can actually be extended into

154
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,840
other areas that we call causal human

155
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,320
biology that also can be powerful

156
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,840
predictors of success of of clinical

157
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,479
trials. And so we want to take those

158
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,280
principles in human genetics, apply them

159
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,120
in other areas. So Khloe talked about uh

160
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,360
some of the work in profiling immune

161
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,759
cells. You know, if we can identify

162
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,919
those pathogenic immune cells, for

163
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,160
examples that are driving diseases like

164
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,639
lupus and figure out how to selectively

165
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,720
deplete those cells, that's causal human

166
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,639
biology. Potentially, that is another

167
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,440
way to actually come up with new drug

168
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,160
targets. Okay. So, we've tried to

169
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,080
distill some of these very complex

170
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,160
topics for drug discovery and

171
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,160
development into five principles. And

172
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,800
behind each of these principles, there's

173
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,160
a tremendous amount of information. And

174
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,600
one of the nice things about going last

175
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,840
in the day is you can kind of pull on

176
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,759
the examples over the course of the day

177
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,680
to kind of really emphasize the these

178
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,280
concepts. So when I made the move from

179
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,280
academics to industry, it was really

180
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,120
because of that first principle. I

181
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,800
thought human genetics could change the

182
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,960
way that we do do drug discovery

183
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,880
development. If only we worked on the

184
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,479
right targets and use human genetics to

185
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,240
pick those targets, everything else

186
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,759
would fall into place. I think the

187
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,160
biggest education that I've had since

188
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,680
joining industry is I realized that yes,

189
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,440
picking the right target is really

190
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,520
important but there are a lot of other

191
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,600
things that come after it uh that are

192
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,400
really important as well and again VJ

193
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,600
gave a great example of MSI 2 show that

194
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,160
how much time goes into understanding

195
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,080
any individual talk any individual

196
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,000
target you don't want to just understand

197
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,560
in this case a genetic association but

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,720
what are the details of the of the

199
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,160
biology of the particular target how do

200
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,000
you want to modulate it. What are you

201
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,639
going to measure once you get into the

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,720
clinic? That's all captured by that

203
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,680
single concept of of causal human

204
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,599
biology. But it's a really really

205
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,759
important starting point for drug

206
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,919
discovery and development. So the second

207
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,680
step then is to match a therapeutic

208
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,280
modality to a molecular mechanism of

209
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,680
action. And Ben just gave you a great

210
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,400
example of how to actually do that in

211
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,319
the form of of crisper cast 9. If you

212
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,120
understand a mutation that is causing

213
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,360
the disease and it's expressed in the

214
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,520
liver, you can figure out how to give

215
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,240
that drug into the liver and correct it

216
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,240
in the liver and make the mutant base go

217
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,639
back to a wild type base. That's a

218
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,479
perfect example of matching modality to

219
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,639
mechanism. We also heard about

220
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,280
manipulating BCL11A

221
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,800
and there it's actually not introducing

222
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,840
something new but it's taking something

223
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,240
out preventing the binding site of a

224
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,199
transcription factor that allows the

225
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,280
repression of fetal hemoglobin. So by

226
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,960
removing that site that's matching

227
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,520
molecular mechanism. You're basically

228
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,520
recapitulating human genetics to turn on

229
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,039
in this case fetal hemoglobin that's

230
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,479
shown to be a very protective and

231
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,800
effective way to um help patients with

232
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,160
cickle cell anemia. But it's a third

233
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,680
category that I've been spending more

234
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,440
time on recently. So if you pick the

235
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,599
right target, you match the right

236
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,919
modality to a molecular mechanism of

237
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,919
action, then you take that molecule into

238
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,960
humans for the first time. And this is

239
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,959
when you really begin to get at dose.

240
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,120
How much of the drug is required?

241
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,719
Schedule. How often do you give it? Do

242
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,800
you give it once a day, twice a day,

243
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,560
once a week? What's the frequency with

244
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,919
which you give the drug? And then what's

245
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,000
the relationship between

246
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,240
pharmacocinetics, the level of drug in

247
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,120
the body, and pharmacodnamics, what that

248
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,040
drug is doing to the target or the cells

249
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,600
within the body. And then how does that

250
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,080
relate to clinical efficacy? So we call

251
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,600
this path to clinical proof of concept.

252
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,720
And as I'll talk about in just a few

253
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,519
minutes, this is the point really for

254
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,320
the first time that you know if a

255
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,760
molecule a medicine is working as you

256
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,240
actually predicted. And so it's this

257
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,480
really important flection point in a

258
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,480
drug discovery journey. Then once you

259
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,399
see clinical proof of concept, step

260
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,480
number four is to accelerate clinical

261
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,560
development as many indications as as

262
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,040
you can at as fast as you can because

263
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,200
there's incredible competition uh to

264
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,880
make not just the first drug but also

265
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,480
the best drug and there are a lot of

266
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,440
people that are doing this across the

267
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,360
entire world and being first and best is

268
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,880
incredibly important. And then all along

269
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,160
the way what you want to do is the fifth

270
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,200
principle uh which is to uh build out a

271
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,040
complete uh compendium of information uh

272
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,560
that will allow this drug to be used in

273
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,560
the most number of patients so the most

274
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,160
number of patients can benefit. So

275
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,000
that's uh maximizing a market access. So

276
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,839
these are the five principles and so

277
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,640
what I thought I would try to do today

278
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,480
is to describe this in a way that uses

279
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:03,040
poker as as a metaphor. So just before I

280
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,880
I start this m how many people actually

281
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,800
play poker.

282
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,399
All right. So a decent number. So Texas

283
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,480
holdem. So this is going to be based

284
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,160
upon the game Texas holdm. And I'll

285
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,360
describe the game to you. And again this

286
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,560
is the first time I've actually used

287
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,720
this metaphor. So you'll have to tell me

288
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,320
if it actually works or not. So causal

289
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,240
human biology matching modality

290
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,120
mechanism. If you play Texas holdm each

291
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,040
person is given two cards. Those cards

292
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,360
are private to you. So I'm playing

293
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,880
against Jesse. I'm playing against Ben.

294
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,399
I shouldn't pick statisticians because

295
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,160
they're really good at this stuff. But

296
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,920
but I I'm playing against them. I've got

297
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,120
my two cards. They've got their two

298
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,120
cards. And I can see mine, but they

299
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,959
can't see my cards. And in this case,

300
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,279
I've got two. I've got an ace and a

301
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,680
queen. Two pretty good high cards. So

302
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,600
this is the target and matching modality

303
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,680
to mechanism. So I'm feeling pretty good

304
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,760
about the hand. In this case, the hand

305
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,839
that I'm taking from research into early

306
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,880
development. Any ideas on what the

307
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,720
average cost of a drug to take from

308
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,040
research into early development is about

309
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,200
how much do you think that costs per

310
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,640
drug taken into early development? Any

311
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,480
estimates? Anybody want to shout out a

312
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,720
number?

313
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,760
100 million. That's actually right.

314
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,320
Yeah. 100 million.

315
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,040
Wow. This is this is a great crowd. Yes.

316
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,040
About hund00 million uh to make that

317
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,360
medicine and take it into humans for for

318
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,120
the first time. So you have to be very

319
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
very careful about how many of these

320
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,360
medicines you you take in into early

321
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,640
development. All right. So then you

322
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,000
start to do your early development

323
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,839
study. This is where you're doing dose

324
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,920
and schedule. You're giving it to the

325
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,079
right patient populations. And this is

326
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,640
when you see a really big inflection

327
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,160
point. So at the start of a clinical

328
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,920
trial

329
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,920
until the end, it's about a 10%

330
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,920
probability of success. At this point,

331
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,920
you go from about a 10% probability of

332
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,079
success. If you do the right trial,

333
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,800
you're going to about a 20, 30, 40,

334
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,120
potentially even a 50% probability of

335
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,839
success after what's called, at least in

336
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,480
poker, the flop. So now you get three

337
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,720
cards. So Jesse and Ben, there are three

338
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,040
cards that we all can play together.

339
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,959
I've got my two private cards, they have

340
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,480
their two private cards, and then we

341
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,800
have three in the middle. This is the

342
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,120
flop. I'm feeling pretty good because I

343
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,680
now have a pair of queens in addition to

344
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,279
ace high. This is a pretty good hand. So

345
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,200
basically what I'm trying to say here, I

346
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,600
hope this metaphor is working, is that

347
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,120
in early development, I'm feeling really

348
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,120
good at this point. I've picked the

349
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,720
right target. I've actually matched a

350
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,880
modality to a molecular mechanism of

351
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,120
action and I've done this early clinical

352
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,200
development study and it looks really

353
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,440
positive. But now I need to complete the

354
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,760
full hand. We do accelerated full

355
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,160
development and we start to see in this

356
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,160
case an ace. Now I got a pair of aces,

357
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,839
two queens, two pair. That's a good

358
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,320
hand. But at the end of the day, it's

359
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,120
about having a great label the FDA can

360
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,200
approve. And in this case, a queen,

361
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,839
that's a full house. That hand wins

362
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,000
almost every single time. So basically,

363
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,639
you need all of these together in order

364
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,279
to have a winning hand, in which case

365
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,720
this is a an approved drug. I mentioned

366
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,800
about hund00 million um to take a drug

367
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,160
into humans for the first time, and it's

368
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,399
over two two3 billion to ultimately get

369
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,079
a drug approved. But it's not the cost

370
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,680
of the successes, it's the cost of the

371
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,000
failures that really drives up that

372
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,720
price. So this is why human genetics can

373
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,079
help us with these billion dollar bets.

374
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,760
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going

375
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,519
to go through a few examples of of

376
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,279
programs in our pipeline. And I'm going

377
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,639
to go through them relatively quickly,

378
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,399
but the points are really going to

379
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,920
emphasize everything that I've just

380
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,760
talked about in the last few minutes.

381
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,079
Picking the right targets, matching

382
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,240
modality mechanism, seeing that early

383
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,959
clinical data, and ultimately doing what

384
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,360
you can to accelerate full development.

385
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,880
Now, and just one other example here,

386
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,720
you could have a competitor that goes

387
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,000
after the exact same targets. They pick

388
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,000
the right target, they make the right

389
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,079
molecule, but they stumble in early

390
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,760
clinical development. They don't design

391
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,519
the right early development trial. They

392
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,600
don't have the right biomarkers. They

393
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,720
don't have VJ on their team to really

394
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,639
understand details of of the mechanism

395
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,560
and how to understand if this drug is

396
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,399
working the way that it should. And so,

397
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,839
ultimately, uh, they're they're not

398
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,440
successful. So again, it's more than

399
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,360
just picking the right targets and

400
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,120
making the right molecules. Uh there's a

401
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,720
lot that happens in early development as

402
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,320
well. Okay. So the first story that I'm

403
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,680
going to tell you very quickly is a

404
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,399
story that I worked on when I was back

405
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,320
in academics. And this was understanding

406
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,199
the genetic basis of a molecule called

407
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,040
tick 2. And what this is showing is the

408
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,639
causal human biology for this is very

409
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,720
compelling. There are at least two or

410
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,160
three different common alals that are

411
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,920
loss of function and protect from risk

412
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,000
of multiple autoimmune diseases

413
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,079
including psoriasis, lupus and

414
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,760
rheumatoid arthritis. Uh there was a

415
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,839
study that was published by Lars Fuger

416
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,360
and colleagues Khali Dendrew that showed

417
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,600
that one copy leads to about a 10 to 20%

418
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,680
reduction in tick 2 signaling but two

419
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,120
copies that is in the homozygous state

420
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,199
leads to about a 70% reduction in tick 2

421
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,600
signaling. So it's loss of function at

422
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,600
about a 70% level that protects from

423
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,760
monmunity. And then this was one of the

424
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,560
first studies that actually did a few

425
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,720
was to look for few waswas as a way to

426
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,480
predict adverse drug events. And what we

427
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,639
saw with those same variants is they did

428
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,240
not increase risk of infection or other

429
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,000
blood disgraases. So it seemed like not

430
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,000
only was a good target based upon

431
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,720
efficacy, but it was a potentially a

432
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,360
safe target as well. But it was really

433
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,440
hard to make a therapeutic molecule

434
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,519
against this target. on the left hand

435
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,760
side is the regulatory domain. That's

436
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,480
where that that triangle is. There are a

437
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,040
lot of other molecules like tick 2, Jack

438
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,600
one, Jack 2, Jack 3 that have a lot of

439
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,279
homology in that orthosteric domain. So

440
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,320
every single time a company tried to

441
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,959
make a binder against the orthosteric

442
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,040
park pocket, they hit Jack one, Jack 2

443
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,519
and Jack 3, and that was associated with

444
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,680
side effects. So what BMS chemists did,

445
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,920
what BMS biologists did is they designed

446
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,560
a phenotypic screen and they uncovered

447
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,720
this alossteric pocket. Um actually I

448
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,279
got it backwards. The active site is

449
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,600
where most of the homology is. The

450
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,519
regulatory domain where the triangle is

451
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,519
that's where we identify the BMS

452
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,839
scientists a drug could bind to this

453
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,639
alossteric pocket but it could lock the

454
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,199
active domain in the inactive state. And

455
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,839
so BMS discovered a small molecule that

456
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,320
really rec recapitulated human genetics

457
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,639
in a very faithful way. And then in the

458
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,839
first in human clinical trial in this

459
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,399
case uh looking at an interferon

460
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,600
signature in psoriasis you can see about

461
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,079
a 70% reduction. So really precisely

462
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,399
phenopying the human genetics. So about

463
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,040
70% inhibition for human genetics and

464
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,839
about 70% inhibition uh for the drug. So

465
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,160
there's really nice phenopy of the drug

466
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,560
on this particular phenotype. Um and so

467
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,480
so tick 2 is now approved in psoriasis

468
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,040
and we have ongoing trials and other

469
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,959
autoimmune diseases specifically lupus

470
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,199
and and chogrin. So really if you go

471
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,680
through the metaphor you know you have

472
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,199
full house this is a successful drug and

473
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,720
an approved drug and we have other

474
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,880
ongoing trials as well. Okay. So now I

475
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,360
want to go to that second principle

476
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,959
matching modality to mechanism. And to

477
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,199
me again if I go back to where I was

478
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,199
about 15 or 20 years ago in academics I

479
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,360
was really focused on the target and

480
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,120
then I came to appreciate how much there

481
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,760
is now in our therapeutic armamentarium.

482
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,280
In the late 90s basically 90% of drugs

483
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,199
were small molecules. There were a

484
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,280
handful of more conventional auto uh

485
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,440
more conventional antibodies. Fast

486
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,919
forward today you've got and this is

487
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,919
just the BMS portfolio. You've got a

488
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,679
bunch of different ways to modulate

489
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,000
therapeutic targets. And there are a lot

490
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,480
on this list that we just don't pursue,

491
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,320
including many of the the genetic based

492
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,919
approaches that you've heard about over

493
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,919
the course of the day. But what I'll do

494
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,400
is I'll walk through a couple of stories

495
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,200
starting with small molecules, but I'll

496
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,240
touch on on a few of these. Um, so here

497
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,080
is a genetic target TLR7. Uh, there's

498
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,480
very strong human genetics as shown on

499
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,760
the far left. So TLR7 gain of function

500
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,559
mutations lead to a lupus-like phenotype

501
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,480
suggesting that inhibiting TLR7 could be

502
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,160
therapeutically beneficial. There are

503
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,919
some challenges in actually inhibiting

504
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,320
this target and that you had to get it a

505
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,520
small molecule to actually inhibit this

506
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,360
within the context of the endoome and on

507
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,840
the far right is that first in human

508
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,320
clinical study where we also saw a

509
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,880
change in an interferon signature uh for

510
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,200
a drug called aphimatorin. Um this drug

511
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,880
is now uh has just finished phase two

512
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,039
and is entering into phase three

513
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,360
clinical trials. Uh and this is some of

514
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,240
the clinical data uh that shows a very

515
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,080
nice separation in a subset of patients

516
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,320
uh with lupus that are called cutaneous

517
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,400
lupus. So CLE and what you're actually

518
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,640
seeing in the graph in the bottom row in

519
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,320
the purple is a nice difference between

520
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,400
a clinical score in patients with

521
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,200
cutaneous lupus compared to those same

522
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,559
patients who received a placebo. Um I

523
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,320
want to spend just a few minutes on a

524
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,720
different therapeutic modality target of

525
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,400
protein degradation. This is a way to

526
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,320
actually not just inhibit a a target of

527
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,799
interest but to degrade that that target

528
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,960
of interest. Um so the idea here is

529
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,720
there are a lot of uh validated uh

530
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,799
targets a lot of human disease

531
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,880
associated targets but most of them are

532
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,520
not amendable to more conventional small

533
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,919
and large molecules. In the case of

534
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,520
certain types of uh of proteins such as

535
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,120
transcription factors or those with

536
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,880
scaffolding functions, there's no

537
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,559
enzyatic function to inhibit. You have

538
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,200
to actually degrade or get rid of the

539
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:30,000
target, which is often difficult to do.

540
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,120
Um, and there's also benefit uh in terms

541
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,840
of using uh protein degraders uh to

542
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,200
overcome resistance of uh of small

543
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,039
molecule uh kynise inhibitors as well.

544
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Um so this is a story that actually

545
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:45,679
builds nicely on the story that VJ told

546
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,840
in terms of um being able to induce

547
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,919
fetal hemoglobin. Um what I'm showing

548
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,440
you on this slide is that we actually

549
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,440
have identified two um uh one uh two two

550
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,160
targets that are that influence fetal

551
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,480
hemoglobin production. One of those two

552
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,480
is a genetically validated target. It

553
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,919
goes by the name Pokemon, also known as

554
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,160
ZBTV 7A. The other target is Whiz. And

555
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,120
what we found is that we can identify a

556
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,799
molecular glue molecule um that can bind

557
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,320
to an E3 ligase on one part. So it's

558
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,000
basically one molecule that's a

559
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,160
therapeutic molecule binds to an E3

560
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,320
ligase and then it recruits these two

561
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,200
transcription factors to a single

562
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,919
complex. It shuttles them to the

563
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,320
proteosome and leads to degradation. So

564
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:33,039
we can basically degrade these two

565
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,679
transcription factors turning on fetal

566
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,400
hemoglobin in our pre-clinical models

567
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,320
and we are um in clinical trials today

568
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,480
and I think by by the end of the year

569
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,039
early next year uh we should know the

570
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,760
extent to which this turns on a fetal

571
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,520
hemoglobin. Um so if it does work it has

572
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,520
the potential to be an oral small

573
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,080
molecule pill that achieves the same

574
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,480
level of efficacy as cascade which is an

575
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,159
Xvivo uh gene editing uh approach.

576
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,080
Uh here's another example where the

577
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,640
target BCL6 is a well-known um uh

578
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,640
ankcoenic driver. Here the genetic data

579
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,720
is not from germline genetic data but

580
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,240
it's from sematic cell genetic data. So

581
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,880
there's a lot of great sematic cell

582
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,200
genetic data in oncology. Again, you

583
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,200
heard about it from VJ in terms of a

584
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,960
clonal amount of poesis, but many of

585
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,400
these encogenic drivers can actually

586
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:27,039
lead to to uh to cancers and BCL6 is a

587
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,640
known encogenic driver. Um but like many

588
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,799
transcription factors and other targets,

589
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,640
it's just very difficult to drug with a

590
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,320
typical kinase inhibitor. So what

591
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,000
scientists at BMS did is they created

592
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,080
what's called a heterobifunctional

593
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,200
degrader. So one arm binds to BCL6, the

594
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,440
other arm binds to an E3 liase called

595
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,480
cereablon. It brings the complex

596
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,400
together leads to BCL6 degradation. So

597
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,720
very strong human biology in this case

598
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,120
from from sematic cell genetics. We've

599
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,840
got a really interesting uh degrader

600
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,159
that's heterofunctional by degrader. And

601
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,080
this is also a program that's advancing

602
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,080
in clinical development and we'll know

603
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,559
probably within the next year if we're

604
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,720
seeing the PKPD relationship that we

605
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,400
expect. Okay, just a few more quick

606
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,039
stories before I go on to the saturation

607
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,919
mutagenesis part of the talk. Uh and

608
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,840
that is biootherrapeutics. Uh and here

609
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,240
again another story of causal human

610
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,039
biology. In this case it's T-regs and

611
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,720
cancer. There's no really strong human

612
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:29,120
genetics to implicate CCR8 positive

613
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,559
T-regs in cancer. But through single

614
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,400
cell sequencing, and you've heard a lot

615
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,960
about that today, what we've been able

616
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,360
to do is to identify that a subset of

617
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,120
T-regs uh that are identified in

618
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,039
patients with lung cancer and other

619
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,000
types of cancers are a negative

620
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,600
predictor uh for for outcome. that is

621
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,320
the presence of these highly um uh um

622
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,080
suppressive inflam or highly suppressive

623
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,320
CC positive T-regs are uh a negative

624
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,640
predictor of response to checkpoint

625
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,080
inhibitors and so we predict is by

626
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,200
binding to CCR8 on the surface of cells

627
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:07,679
and degrading um uh the basically

628
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,520
getting rid of these CCR8 positive

629
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,360
T-regs will be able to allow anti- PD1

630
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,600
and other checkpoint inhibitors uh to

631
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,720
work more effectively. This is also a

632
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,960
program that is in in first in human

633
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,720
studies now and we should know more in

634
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,559
the next year or two whether we've

635
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,679
achieved clinical proof of concept. All

636
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,919
right, I'm going to go through one more

637
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,440
example and do this very quickly because

638
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,679
we talked about small molecules and

639
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,000
large molecules but we're also in an age

640
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,480
where we can actually engineer living

641
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,400
cells uh to be therapeutics themselves

642
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,120
and this is in the form of of autotogus

643
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,120
carti. Um and then to me this is one of

644
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,840
the most exciting areas of science and

645
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,840
biology right now. Uh because I used to

646
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,159
practice clinical rheatology. Patients

647
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,559
would come in young women childbearing

648
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,919
age with lupus. They would they would

649
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,600
give them a very strong

650
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,600
immunosuppressive which could get their

651
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,280
disease under control and inevitably

652
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,760
they would ask well when do I come off

653
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:05,120
of these medicines and the answer was

654
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,720
almost always never. So imagine being,

655
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,400
you know, a young healthy person

656
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,520
suddenly getting this new diagnosis and

657
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,200
being told you're going to be on

658
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,080
imunosuppressants for the rest of your

659
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,320
life is pretty devastating. So this

660
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,720
concept of being able to reset immune

661
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,120
memory to deplete the auto reactive

662
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,440
cells to get rid of them completely and

663
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,600
allowing a new immune system to

664
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,919
reconstitute and basically that new

665
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,320
reconstituted immune system is healthy.

666
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,840
This is what we're able to do with

667
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,360
auttogus cartis. for these carti cells.

668
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,799
Um, but by the way, just on the bottom

669
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,880
left, there wasn't a whole lot of

670
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,279
genetic data that implicated C19.

671
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,200
Specifically, it was a human

672
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,760
pharmarmacology study where an

673
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,559
investigator uh, uh, George Shet

674
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,880
actually took CD19 CARTT, which is

675
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,400
approved for lymphoma, tried it in a

676
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,480
very small number of patients with

677
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,919
lupus, and sure enough, it completely

678
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,400
reset their immune system, and they've

679
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,279
been off all of imunosuppressive drugs

680
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,840
for now for several years. um we've now

681
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,360
treated multiple patients uh dozens of

682
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,120
patients with not just lupus but other

683
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,919
autoimmune diseases and we've been able

684
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,360
to recapitulate this finding as well. So

685
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,440
causing biology from human

686
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,919
pharmarmacology matching modality

687
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,120
mechanism it's an autotogus engineered

688
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,840
cell that actually kills the CD19

689
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,760
lineage of B cells and we now have

690
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,240
clinical proof of concept and we're

691
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,919
entering into registrational trials. Um,

692
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,880
so these are the examples that sort of

693
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:33,120
show how the sort of framework of these

694
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,120
five principles work in action and how

695
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,520
we're using them all the time within our

696
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,960
portfolio today. Okay, so I have about

697
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,279
10 minutes left and I'm going to go

698
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,240
through uh how we're trying to expand

699
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:47,600
our understanding of individual variants

700
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,080
uh to basically build out this toolkit

701
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,600
even further. Um, so when I moved from

702
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,840
academic to industry, this was kind of

703
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,840
my simplistic view of how I thought we

704
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,640
could use human genetics to identify new

705
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,360
targets. Not just identifying a single

706
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,120
alil at a particular gene, but with

707
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,279
sequencing, we'd find more and more

708
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,320
alals. And we could say, all right, each

709
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:10,960
one of those X's that's meant to be a um

710
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,679
that's disease associated. Along the Y

711
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,960
ais is a human phenotypes. Imagine high

712
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,200
LDL cholesterol, high risk of disease,

713
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,520
um, as examples, you know, high body

714
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,880
mass index. And if you could find alals

715
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,559
that were associated with a human

716
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,159
phenotype that was an appropriate

717
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,400
surrogate for drug efficacy, and you

718
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,159
could understand the function, gain of

719
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,559
function or loss of function, you could

720
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,880
begin to estimate these dose response

721
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,880
curves, an efficacy curve, and also know

722
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,440
if there was an adequate therapeutic

723
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,520
window. Um the challenge has been and

724
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,919
we've been talking about this all day is

725
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,840
we can find that sort of x-axis pretty

726
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,840
easily using bioank. So we can look

727
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,679
quantitatively at whether an alil is

728
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,480
associated with high or low cholesterol.

729
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,240
What level of risk um is contributed in

730
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,480
terms of risk of autoimmune diseases.

731
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,840
But what's incredibly hard is getting

732
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,600
that variant uh to function. Uh and um

733
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,440
just a really quick story when I just

734
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,000
started my posttos Pierre I don't know

735
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,480
if any of you know ick um but we had

736
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,279
just done one of the first like a thou h

737
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,520
100 thousand snip chips for math metrics

738
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,159
on the hatmap cell lines and we could

739
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,760
actually identify 30% of common variance

740
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,000
and that was a number that totally blew

741
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,200
my mind and I remember I saying to me

742
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,480
and we were sitting over there in one

743
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,000
Kendall Square up in one of the

744
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,279
conference rooms he's like can you

745
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,320
imagine if we could just annotate every

746
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,720
single variant not just by its where it

747
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,880
is in the genome but by its function.

748
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,559
Imagine how much more powerful our

749
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,919
genetic association studies would

750
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,159
actually be. So not just looking at

751
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,320
linkage to singleian and the static is

752
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,000
it associated or not but you could add a

753
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,400
coefficient that tells you something

754
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,279
about function. And I remember thinking

755
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,600
wow is that's a great idea that sounds

756
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:53,200
really hard. And sure enough fast

757
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,640
forward to where we are today. I think

758
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,159
we're getting po we're getting to a

759
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,320
state where we should be able to

760
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,240
incorporate these types of weights into

761
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,840
our association study. So I'm going to

762
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,679
tell you now a story that's going to

763
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,919
build on the tick 2 story that I told

764
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,880
you about earlier. And so the question

765
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,279
here is can we take a known validated

766
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,000
genetic target that has an orthosteric

767
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,039
pocket and an alossteric pocket. Can we

768
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,120
mutate every single amino acid uh at

769
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,840
this particular protein and can we

770
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,080
uncover the known alossteric and the

771
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,480
orthosteric sites where these drugs

772
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,600
actually bind and can we learn new

773
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,200
things about um this particular molecule

774
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,760
that could potentially help with large

775
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,320
scale association study.

776
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,760
So um just just quickly in terms of what

777
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,480
we know about the genetic variation

778
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,000
across tick 2 and the upper graph is the

779
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,000
clinbar variants. So there are three

780
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,159
variants rare variants that can when

781
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,559
when tick 2 is knocked out completely

782
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,720
causes primary immune deficiency. The

783
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,960
next graph below is the nomad uh

784
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,520
variants uh and there are several

785
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,440
hundred uh variants and that's shown at

786
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,440
the top part of the bar graph and above

787
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,520
a particular frequency spectrum is

788
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,120
what's shown below. And if you blow this

789
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,960
out and look at the fre frequently

790
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,880
spectrum what you can see on the far

791
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,240
right are the four common variants.

792
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,880
Three of these are associated with

793
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,640
protection from autoimmunity. But if you

794
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,000
take a threshold of 10 to the minus 4th

795
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,640
or less, they're about 447 misses snips

796
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,880
from the UK bioank that are within this

797
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,080
particular category. Um these are all

798
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,159
below you. 01 in terms of the minor

799
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,080
little frequency threshold. We know

800
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,159
nothing about the function. But can we

801
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,880
use saturation immunogenesis to assign

802
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,880
function to each of these 447 variants?

803
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,880
So this is where we worked with Octant

804
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,520
um to do a deep mutational scan where

805
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,080
again we mutated every single amino acid

806
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,840
by every other possible amino acid

807
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,399
across the entire protein. And we did

808
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,760
this with two different assays. The

809
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,000
first assay that I'll tell you quickly

810
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,640
about is an interferon signal signaling

811
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,039
assay. Uh what you can actually see uh

812
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,279
is there's a cassette that's inserted

813
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:00,960
that has different tick 2 amino acid

814
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,480
changes that codes for uh the uh tick 2

815
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,720
that will bind to the interferon

816
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,720
signaling receptor. It'll signal down

817
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,559
through and there's an interferon

818
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,080
signaling response element which can

819
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,440
then be read out in the form of a

820
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,480
barcode. So about 11% of amino acids

821
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,039
when mutated by this assay could lead to

822
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,600
changes in interferon signaling. uh and

823
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:24,000
you can see uh in particular this line

824
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,880
uh where a stop variant was introduced

825
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,799
but you can also begin to see domains

826
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,039
and I'll describe these domains in just

827
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,919
a minute. Um the second assay that we

828
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,360
did was a protein abundance assay. to a

829
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,039
simpler assay and I'm going to come back

830
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,720
to this because I think this has some

831
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,039
application as we think about scaling

832
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,399
this approach up but a protein abundance

833
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:47,360
assay where we also introduce um every

834
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,799
single amino acid variant into tick 2

835
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,640
and then we measure we can sort by GFP

836
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,279
also with a barcode and just measure

837
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,039
relative protein abundance. So about 20%

838
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,960
of amino acids uh when mutated lead to a

839
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,640
signal in this particular assay and what

840
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,520
I think you can appreciate is there's a

841
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,360
lot of overlap uh between uh the two

842
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,760
different assays. And when you look at

843
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,080
where where the um alossteric site and

844
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,720
the is located, this is the name of the

845
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,480
drug dravisitib. You can identify the

846
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,559
alossteric binding site with this

847
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,880
functional assay and you can also

848
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,200
identify very clearly the catalytic

849
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,440
site. Uh and at least in the protein

850
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:29,120
abundance assay, you can identify the

851
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,720
disease associated P104 A variant. Um

852
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,640
although it's not quite as clear I know

853
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,039
it's difficult to see it's not quite as

854
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,399
as clear that that variant has an effect

855
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,080
on on interfere on signaling.

856
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,240
So there are other positive controls

857
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,320
that gave us confidence that the assays

858
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,880
were working including uh different

859
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,039
annotations by alpha missense some

860
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,880
literature associated loss of function

861
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,519
variants and then three variants that

862
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,799
were reported as as pathogenic. Okay.

863
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,240
And I'm going to come back to the three

864
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:00,799
starred sites because these identify

865
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:04,720
potentially novel aloseric sites. So um

866
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,159
this identifies again um a number of of

867
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,679
variants that could be loss of function

868
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,640
or gain of function by protein

869
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,360
expression along the the y-axis or

870
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,679
interferon signaling along the x-axis.

871
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,760
As I mentioned P104A which is one of the

872
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,399
disease associated varants comes up with

873
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,440
a good signal by protein expression but

874
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,120
but not by uh interferon signaling. Um

875
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,679
and I think with these types of assays

876
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,840
we can begin to model um where these

877
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,320
mutations are occurring on the two

878
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,640
domains of tick 2 the the the the

879
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,279
regulatory domain and then the uh the

880
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,880
the kynise domain. We also refer to

881
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:41,440
these as the the catalytic and

882
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,000
non-catalytic domains. Um and you can

883
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,640
see again the active site alsteric site

884
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,240
and the location of P104A.

885
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,360
Um but there are these variants that

886
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,960
look like they have an effect on

887
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,519
interferon alpha but no effect on

888
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,039
protein abundance. um could this be a

889
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,440
potential way to uncover novel

890
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,039
alossteric sites? Um so what we did is

891
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,360
this filtering mechanism to look for

892
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:04,320
variants that affected interferon alpha

893
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,559
signaling along the top uh whether there

894
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,480
was evidence of destabilization.

895
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,440
If not, could this be potentially a

896
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,679
catalytic alesteric site? And you can

897
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,480
see here we're just annotating a few of

898
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,200
these potential sites, which actually

899
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,240
two of these sites are right at this

900
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,559
kyna pseudocinase interface as shown by

901
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,919
the blue stars. Um, and there are and

902
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,080
this is a fulllength view of the

903
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,600
protein. um where you can actually see

904
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:34,960
in in uh yellow here is the kind of this

905
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:38,080
ribbon of where the receptor itself is

906
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,600
uh is uh is is going through uh the

907
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,679
protein and the protein is binding

908
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,720
around it. Uh and there are potential

909
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,320
sites uh not just on the where the

910
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,039
protein binds or interacts with the

911
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,360
plasma membrane but also where tick 2 is

912
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,200
engaging with the the interferon

913
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,960
receptor.

914
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,120
Um now one other way that we actually

915
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,000
use this data is to actually look at

916
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,640
where the drug dravisit binds and can we

917
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,840
actually map um residues that are b

918
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,079
interacting between the the the gene the

919
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,560
protein tick 2 uh and the known

920
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,480
inhibitor at the alossteric site. Uh and

921
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,520
the quick version of this story is yes

922
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,320
we can as we actually go through and use

923
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,000
different concentrations of the drug. So

924
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,079
lower concentration of the drug you

925
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,720
really find only those sites that are

926
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,040
direct directly interacting uh with the

927
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,480
drug itself and at higher concentrations

928
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,879
of the drug um you identify um other

929
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,960
other sites as well. So it provides a

930
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:39,280
nice kind of functional complement uh to

931
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:42,320
structural data. Okay. So we started by

932
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,919
saying if we could only just annotate uh

933
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,760
the human um phenotype data by by

934
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,599
function and what I've told you at least

935
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,000
for tick 2 we've been able to use deep

936
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,879
mutational scan to begin to assign

937
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,399
functions to each of those 447 variants

938
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,160
and so now I want to go back to

939
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,480
basically the question that I had

940
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,880
proposed 20 or so years ago is if we

941
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,119
begin to incorporate this information

942
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,359
into our genetic association studies you

943
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,280
know can we actually have more

944
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,000
wellpowered powered rare variant

945
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,200
associations. And so we took these um uh

946
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,119
these these variants uh and we annotated

947
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,920
uh whether not just by common and rare

948
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,920
but by level of tick to 2 um expression.

949
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,079
And we used a couple of traditional

950
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,400
burden test methods that are shown here

951
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:31,040
without any waiting and it didn't find

952
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:33,359
an association with the 300 or 35,000

953
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,880
cases from the UK biioank compared to

954
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:39,680
308 uh uh controls. uh but we began to

955
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:43,040
incorporate the output from the um the

956
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,040
DMS variant scores into a model, we

957
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,200
began to see more statistically

958
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,960
significant associations with this

959
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,440
genetic burden test. So again suggesting

960
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,520
that as our methods of assigning

961
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,520
function to each of the variants become

962
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,760
more and more powerful, we should be

963
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,480
able to improve power of rare variant

964
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,160
association studies.

965
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,920
Um you know I will say in listening to

966
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,000
the talks today sort of occurs to me

967
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,760
that if we can do this more and more uh

968
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,280
not just with these types of functional

969
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,040
data but with the predictive data and

970
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,119
the modeling data that has been talked

971
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,720
about today hopefully we'll be able to

972
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,720
do a better job of basically

973
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,960
incorporating these types of weights

974
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,119
into our association studies. And in

975
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,079
fact, here are a few newer methods that

976
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,720
don't use um uh functional data directly

977
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:30,000
uh but do appear to have uh stronger and

978
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:33,040
more wellpowered um statistical results

979
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,400
uh using the same uh data set. Okay, so

980
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,040
just two more slides and then I'm going

981
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,680
to stop. Uh I want to then sort of talk

982
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,680
about genetic associations and how this

983
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,240
is used. We're using this information to

984
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,640
guide indication selection. So what I'm

985
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,119
showing you on this particular chart is

986
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,480
three v are three variants within tick

987
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,720
2. And you can see for psoriasis, RA and

988
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,880
lupus, these three variants are

989
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,200
protective at a very high level of

990
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,119
statistical significance. Inflammatory

991
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,880
bowel disease has just a different

992
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,200
pattern here where one of the three

993
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,480
variants looks like it's a risk variant.

994
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,560
And this is something that we haven't

995
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,320
really able been able to figure out. Um

996
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,000
but it does look like it has a very

997
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,119
different pattern in inflammatory bowel

998
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,839
disease. And at least the clinical

999
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,560
trials to date have been successful in

1000
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:20,560
psoriasis. They have not been successful

1001
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,119
in inflammatory bowel disease. That is

1002
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,480
so tick 2 did not work in treating

1003
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,720
patients with inflammatory bowel

1004
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,960
disease. And as I've mentioned, studies

1005
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,480
are ongoing with lupus. So we think and

1006
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,040
hope that it'll work in this particular

1007
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,960
indication. Um but we'll know more by

1008
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,280
the end of the year. Um but if you

1009
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,200
actually sort of plot out uh the the the

1010
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,640
different variants uh in a slightly

1011
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,920
different way um and look at um the

1012
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,000
opposing effects across the proteome

1013
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,320
again you see in some cases the variants

1014
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,720
act in the same direction in other in

1015
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,720
other instances they act in in opposite

1016
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,960
direction. Okay so I'm going to stop

1017
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,720
here but just to conclude I know I went

1018
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,480
through things pretty quickly. Most

1019
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,720
drugs fail because of lack of efficacy.

1020
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,560
Hopefully human genetics can help. I

1021
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,280
talked about placing billion-dollar bets

1022
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,359
using these principles to think about

1023
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,280
making the right decisions not just for

1024
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,640
the target and the modality but how do

1025
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,280
we actually do those early clinical

1026
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,280
studies and ultimately how do we do full

1027
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,680
development for drug approvals. Um

1028
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,720
genetic dose response curves um can

1029
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,520
hopefully be used to define uh exciting

1030
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,079
targets and these alyic series and the

1031
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,240
deep mutational scans in tick 2 um have

1032
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,400
the ability to further build out these

1033
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,680
genetic dose response curves. And so I

1034
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,839
guess you know the question that I would

1035
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,839
leave you all with is what what should

1036
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,560
be done next? Is there a way for us to

1037
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:43,040
do saturation mutenesis across a larger

1038
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,280
proportion of the proteium or are the

1039
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,119
computational methods sufficiently uh

1040
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,880
strong at this point in time that we

1041
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,960
don't need to necessarily do these types

1042
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,119
of of functional studies. Um so there's

1043
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,599
a lot I think um we could uh we could

1044
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,440
certainly uh discuss. Um before I do, I

1045
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,440
want to let you know that um the paper

1046
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,400
on deep mutational scan should be posted

1047
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,400
on bioarchchive uh this week. Uh here

1048
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,200
are the authors and again a special

1049
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,599
shout out to the scientist at at Octant

1050
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,520
who did really all of the saturation

1051
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,599
mutagenesis work but working closely

1052
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,200
with Joe Moranville and his team uh to

1053
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,880
work through the associations that I

1054
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,880
described to you. So thank you very

1055
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,880
much.

1056
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,880
>> Thank you. Any questions?

1057
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:40,400
Lovely talk, Robert.

1058
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,640
And I'm very fond of it sick, too. Uh,

1059
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,200
so I I feel like there's like a butt

1060
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,800
coming here.

1061
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,880
>> Ben,

1062
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,440
the question ask is that the question

1063
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,400
I'm gonna ask is um about the tick 2

1064
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,040
functional essay.

1065
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,640
>> Yeah. I think, you know, to me a lot of

1066
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,839
this turns around the quality of the

1067
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,359
gene specific assays and how well we

1068
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:01,680
think they're actually recapitulating

1069
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,280
the function that may be perturbed by

1070
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,640
the variance that we're introducing.

1071
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,599
Right? So, you got to really trust the

1072
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,920
assay part.

1073
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,839
>> And so, I guess the question is how many

1074
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,560
genes do you think we have that caliber

1075
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,960
of assay for? Is that assay capturing

1076
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,320
all of the functions for kick 2? And how

1077
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,240
do you think about approaching it in

1078
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,440
that way versus I think a lot of what

1079
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,000
we've heard about today is you know

1080
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,359
transcrytoics and general cellular

1081
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,640
properties but they're maybe not

1082
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,599
specific about the function of the

1083
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,280
protein itself.

1084
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,880
>> There there was a lot of calibrating the

1085
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,400
interferon assay. There was a second

1086
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,880
assay that actually never worked

1087
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,720
measuring 23 signaling that we never you

1088
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,280
know were able to sort of validate with

1089
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,960
the positive controls. P4A is a known

1090
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,640
functional variant and it didn't come up

1091
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,720
in the interferon assay. I mean I kind

1092
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,560
of intrigued by this protein abundance

1093
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,400
assay. So maybe that is something that

1094
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,720
could be done um at scale and is

1095
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,560
sufficiently agnostic to sort of nuances

1096
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,240
of biology. So that's the one that I

1097
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,839
sort of wonder is that something that we

1098
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,880
could actually scale up and make

1099
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:59,359
relationships to circulating um pro

1100
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,240
proteins as well.

1101
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:06,000
>> Yeah, Brad.

1102
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,079
>> Yeah, this is me. Oh yeah, nice talk.

1103
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,240
Remember David Alcheler talking about

1104
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,920
the arrow of time so many taught me

1105
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,800
about that 15 years ago or something

1106
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,560
like that. It's a beautiful application.

1107
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,800
One the one exception was the CCR8

1108
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,440
or the getting rid of the T-reg

1109
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,400
populations. And there's so much data

1110
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,240
now on changes in population of cells

1111
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,640
and micro environment cancer and other

1112
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,520
diseases. That's not quite causal

1113
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,760
though, right? It's just associated. So

1114
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,400
how do you you're you're clearly using

1115
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,599
that in one of your as a premise for one

1116
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,280
one of your studies.

1117
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,960
>> Yeah. How widely are you using that and

1118
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,440
how do you get at causality in those

1119
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,359
cases?

1120
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,480
>> Yeah. So I think I think in that case so

1121
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,319
you're totally right. I mean you're

1122
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,599
basically looking at an association the

1123
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,920
presence of these T-regs in patients who

1124
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,680
don't respond to checkpoint blockade.

1125
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,760
That's a that's a correlation. There's

1126
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,680
not a causal relation. We try to

1127
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,200
actually look more longitudinally to

1128
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,440
understand you know what do we know

1129
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,760
about the phenotype of those T-Rexs? You

1130
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,880
know when do they infiltrate? Um but at

1131
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,040
the end of the day it's more of a

1132
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,800
correlative relationship than than than

1133
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,200
the causal relationship in that specific

1134
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,319
case. So I think you know I we often say

1135
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,480
you know causal human biology yes no and

1136
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,560
it's far more I think of a gradient and

1137
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,240
I would say something like tick 2 very

1138
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,839
strong that's probably a you know three

1139
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,319
to fourfold increased probability of

1140
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:28,960
success. CCR8 I'd probably put it as a

1141
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:31,040
you know you know 50 you know 100% maybe

1142
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,520
a 50% increased probability of success

1143
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,960
but not the same level as I think some

1144
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,040
of the genetics that we actually talked

1145
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,560
about

1146
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:43,920
but one right here uh

1147
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:47,040
very cool talk and um on the tick 2

1148
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,720
screen I was wondering about the

1149
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,280
in the case where you don't have changes

1150
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,160
in abundance but you do see effect in

1151
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:58,000
activity and how much of those changes

1152
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,400
were uh due to disruption or creation of

1153
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,079
denovo phosphorilation sites altering

1154
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,079
you know protein activity which is an

1155
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,319
old you know a way that a lot of these

1156
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,839
kynases are actually regulated by and

1157
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:10,240
how much of those actually exist

1158
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:11,920
naturally out there and you know just

1159
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,319
yeah it's a great question I'm not

1160
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,680
totally sure um so I I I don't know I

1161
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,560
mean the way that we kind of frame this

1162
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:21,359
is maybe these are novel um alossteric

1163
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,079
sites but I think that that particular

1164
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,280
biology is not entirely clear to me so I

1165
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,800
think that's going to take more work to

1166
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,800
sort of sort out. Thank you.

1167
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,480
>> All right, a question in the or question

1168
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,480
in the back there.

1169
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,800
>> Uh thank you that was really

1170
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,400
interesting. I was wondering you know

1171
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,319
when you when we talk about how genetics

1172
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,079
informs drug discovery my impression is

1173
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,160
it's mostly on the sense of like one

1174
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,839
variant going to one trait but as your

1175
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,160
example in the last few slides showed we

1176
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:00,160
have a lot more much richer phenotyping

1177
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,359
of individuals now like and now we have

1178
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,440
the opportunity to look at variant

1179
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,280
plyotrophy do you have any comments on

1180
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,359
whether there's something that we what

1181
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,880
can we do with plyotrophy now that we

1182
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,000
have this data like you think it will be

1183
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,599
useful

1184
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,440
>> I think I think plyotropy can be used

1185
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,640
for a couple things one it can be used

1186
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,000
to guide indications as a way to say it

1187
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,680
works here, it's going to work in the

1188
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,160
next two or three indications as well.

1189
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,240
But I think plyotropy can also be used

1190
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,040
to begin to predict you know adverse

1191
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,480
drug events and so plyotropy can work

1192
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,000
both ways. It can help you with

1193
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,839
phenotypes that are good surrogates for

1194
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,440
efficacy but also help you for good

1195
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,839
phenotypes that are surrogates for for

1196
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,839
toxicity.

1197
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:39,440
>> And I know we're over time so maybe we

1198
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:41,760
can we can stop here and head over to

1199
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,839
>> maybe one last I think there's already a

1200
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,160
mic out in the audience. Thank you uh

1201
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,319
Robert to to my question is related to

1202
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,640
your last comment about what's next

1203
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,560
should we do the deep mutational scan

1204
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,000
maybe more systematically so while

1205
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,560
you're talking about it that's really

1206
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,640
remind me in oncology field I came from

1207
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,359
oncology field right that when we

1208
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,359
discover all the somatic mutations in

1209
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:06,079
patient and indicating maybe certain

1210
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,040
genes is uncleco gene and having a deep

1211
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,599
map where every single gene are knocked

1212
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,599
out and functional effect measured

1213
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,240
across thousands of cells lines where we

1214
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,720
can correlate. So that's really a deep

1215
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,560
kind of knowledge base we use to build

1216
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,599
that kind of a functional relationship

1217
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,000
and confidence of a genes a causal gene.

1218
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,480
So in some way I would think if we can

1219
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,640
have this kind of systematic functional

1220
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,640
data that will really help us to

1221
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,359
interpret the genetic data in a much

1222
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,839
more objective way.

1223
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,200
>> Yeah.

1224
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,480
>> I don't know if it's feasible but I

1225
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,160
think that would be great to have.

1226
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,599
>> Yeah. I think I think the more I mean we

1227
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,119
talk about how we train and build these

1228
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,960
models. I think we often train them off

1229
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,480
the data sets that we actually have. Um

1230
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,440
you know I sort of imagine a world in

1231
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:52,640
which we actually um you know try to do

1232
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,560
far more like say mutational scans to

1233
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,400
look at protein abundance to uncover

1234
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,960
alesteric sites and maybe then that

1235
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,359
could help us feed you know the models

1236
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,599
that we actually use to identify um

1237
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,359
alsteric these regulatory domains in a

1238
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,440
way that's it's kind of difficult to to

1239
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,119
do today. Um but it does go back to some

1240
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,839
of the assays as Brad mentioned. So I

1241
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,400
think in oncology for example um you

1242
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:15,520
know for for cell cycle growth and and

1243
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,599
basically things that you know

1244
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,200
accelerate growth or decelerate growth

1245
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,359
those are some assays that I think are

1246
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,119
amendable to this type of approach.

1247
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,280
>> Thank you.

1248
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,119
>> Great. Thank you so much for uh the

1249
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:31,240
presentation Robert. Uh please join me

1250
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,240
in giving him another round of applause.
