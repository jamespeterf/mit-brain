00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,640
hello we welcome today Michael good who

2
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:20,439
is a vice president of Music XML

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,840
Technologies at make music Incorporated

4
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,599
creators of finale spart music and so

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,039
many other great things and um and a

6
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,560
dear friend of computational musicology

7
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:33,600
and music theory at MIT welcome Michael

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,320
hi thanks uh for the invitation great to

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,480
be here great virtually yeah I well

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,960
there's some great advantages to to the

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,079
way we're setting things up right now

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,760
and allows you to the students to get to

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,719
meet you in a way that we wouldn't be

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,800
able to perhaps in the

15
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:53,559
past I just want to jump in there and

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,800
and just ask you're the creator of Music

17
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:57,960
XML I mean this is incredible for me to

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,320
be able to talk to person who has done

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,280
so much why did you create music XML in

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,960
2000 and what what problems existed that

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,479
you H to solve with it yeah in 2000 I

22
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,560
was working at sap uh and I was the

23
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,280
representative actually to the MIT media

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,400
lab at that point which will come in

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,159
later and it was just the beginning of

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,640
digital sheet music happening sheet

27
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,000
music direct was out there which I

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,040
didn't know at the time but son Haw

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,799
released things where you could download

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,600
digital sheet I go W this is really cool

31
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,840
until I figured out oh you can only play

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,799
it in in the Su Hawk player well that's

33
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,040
really silly I want and finale and

34
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,399
sellus were there for notation programs

35
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,079
you couldn't move them back and forth

36
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,479
and get anything reasonable out of it

37
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,399
and it was like well the internet boom

38
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,520
is happening and people want to make

39
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,719
money on digital sheet this isn't going

40
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,240
to work without a standard

41
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,880
format to exchange sheet music between

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,040
applications people aren't going to want

43
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,799
to be stuck in just one thing you know

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,119
we need something like midi for musical

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,039
instruments or HTML for the web and a

46
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,399
lot of people tried to do an interchange

47
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:08,840
format and it had succeeded but I

48
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,679
figured I I could give it a good go and

49
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,239
I had some ideas for it and when I

50
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:17,120
visited the media lab uh I went to my

51
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,920
old uh thesis adviser Barry verco

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,560
Professor very verko who was at the

53
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,239
experimental music studio and then the

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,720
media lab and bounced this idea off him

55
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:26,760
you know you've worked in this area a

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,840
lot um am I missing something obvious

57
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,440
that makes it not going to work I said

58
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,599
sounds like it's going to work

59
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,200
go over to Stanford and talk to Walter

60
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:38,480
huet and elor srichfield with Muse data

61
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,280
and talk with David her on of humdrum

62
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,239
because they're doing the stuff closest

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,879
to what you're doing and David humdrum

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,159
was at Stanford that turn so that was

65
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:49,319
great I didn't have to go to Ohio to uh

66
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,760
to talk with him so I did that and

67
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,560
basically the first version of Music XML

68
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:59,319
was an XML version of muse data used XML

69
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,640
because at sap we were using XML to

70
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,640
communicate between our R3 system and

71
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,239
other systems so it's like old G it

72
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,680
seems like you have some standard

73
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,640
technology that the whole computer

74
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,440
industry is behind why not use that to

75
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,080
exchange for music notation back and

76
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,120
forth and so it's just we've got to be

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,560
able to exchange between applications so

78
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,680
the format is optimized very much for

79
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,000
exchange between applications not as a

80
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,480
native uh format for any particular

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,159
application so how did you get um the

82
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,319
initial application you users to to buy

83
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,319
into to this

84
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,519
format yeah that was always going to be

85
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,439
a tricky question I knew that it had to

86
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,400
work with either finale or seia so

87
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,280
nobody would care and so I gave myself

88
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,920
yeah if I can't get it within two years

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,879
or so to do two-way you know not just

90
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,879
writing not just reading but two-way

91
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,000
communication with either finale or

92
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,120
sellus I didn't care which one then

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,239
nobody was going to care and it turned

94
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,799
out that finale had a better plug-in

95
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,560
development git than Celia for that so I

96
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,720
was able to build a plugin that did the

97
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,200
two-way

98
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,760
communication and the way that things

99
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,720
really got rolling is that uh there was

100
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,959
a developer up in the north of Scotland

101
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,560
Graham Jones who had the sharpy music

102
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,400
Reader Program which was the best

103
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,759
scanning program out there

104
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,919
except the differences in the scanning I

105
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,160
mean you could only transfer via mid so

106
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,720
you all the great recognition that you

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,320
got in sharp ey you loss going into a

108
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,039
notation program because midi couldn't

109
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,400
handle it so I contacted Graham and said

110
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,759
hey we got this music XML format you

111
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,560
know if you do that we can and I got

112
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,800
this importer that goes into finale so

113
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,199
if you add this you know you could

114
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,520
really make things work better for

115
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,360
finale and increase your sales and he

116
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,240
said well because he supported nith at

117
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,280
the time nith was an older uh attempt at

118
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,240
a standard notation format that only

119
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,039
worked well for scanners so all the

120
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,800
scanning programs incremented it but

121
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,800
nobody else did so they said well you

122
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,479
could do a nift to music XML converter

123
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,880
and then I wouldn't have to do that I

124
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:13,280
yeah I'm not going to do that so you can

125
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:17,280
do a music XML and he did uh he wrote a

126
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,600
music XML uh exporter out of sharp eye

127
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,919
and then the make music people saw you

128
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,759
geez this scanning thing this is better

129
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:29,400
than what we have built in uh with

130
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,960
finale and it's better than what selus

131
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,960
has so that's when they got interested

132
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,240
in music XML and started to include the

133
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,319
plugin as part of finale 2003 for

134
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,759
Windows uh and and so once finale had it

135
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,160
in there you know you keep marketing it

136
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,199
you keep pushing it you know I I I spent

137
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,319
you know 11 years really pushing

138
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,240
developers to you know marketing to

139
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,880
developers to support the format and now

140
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,000
we have over 250 applications that

141
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:03,160
support it so it's great so you started

142
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,560
with a leader in one domain of music

143
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,199
notation and a leader in a different

144
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,280
domain that could communicate and that

145
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,520
ended up being part of the snowball

146
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,800
instead of right because because it's to

147
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,639
to useful

148
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,120
things and it it solves people go oh

149
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,960
this is useful so because I could

150
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,759
imagine that some of the industry

151
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,800
leaders might might have liked lock in

152
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:29,280
that they had before sure everybody was

153
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,360
very skeptical of of you know a standard

154
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,440
form which is one of the reasons why

155
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,000
it's not designed at all to be a native

156
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,000
format um because it had to be to a

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,240
reference you know it's modeling a

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,199
musical score it's not modeling how

159
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,120
somebody would represent a musical score

160
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,280
because then you would get oh your

161
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,080
favoring finale your favorite sellus and

162
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,680
and and you would get into all that that

163
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,000
conflict but once we had you know make

164
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,599
me we had the finale plug-in developer

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,840
kit and we had the two way communication

166
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:04,919
that was already working when I made my

167
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,039
first presentation to make music and

168
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,639
John Paulson the CEO said yep it's going

169
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,120
to happen nobody's gonna stop you so

170
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,560
make music figured they might as well

171
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,479
jump on board because there wasn't a way

172
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,599
to to stop it now that it was out so

173
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,440
let's use it for for the benefit of the

174
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,000
company which turned out to be for the

175
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,160
enormous benefit of the company over the

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,280
years so just to be clear for people who

177
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,720
see your current position and you were

178
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,520
not an employee at make music this was

179
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,360
not make music project yeah no I started

180
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,280
my in in 2000 at the beginning 2000 I

181
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,240
left sap and started my own company

182
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,759
called radari don't have me name your

183
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,319
company can't nobody can spell it or

184
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,879
pronounce it unless they're Coral

185
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,400
singers uh and I did a a program called

186
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,879
Dole for the uh uh which everybody calls

187
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,879
dlet to go with record a so yeah don't

188
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,639
have me music xml's okay but don't have

189
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,039
me do Crea of names for your products

190
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,800
I'm not very good at it but I can I can

191
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,720
write music notation software pretty

192
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,479
well so I had my own company called

193
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,599
recordar that was through 2011 and then

194
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,319
the assets of the company were purchased

195
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:17,800
by make music in November 2011 and I've

196
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:22,360
been a make music employee ever

197
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:25,800
since so you mentioned 250 applications

198
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,840
uh which from my look this might be an

199
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,159
undercount uh can read or write or do

200
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:36,240
something interesting with music XML I I

201
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:40,120
imagine you define that a success

202
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,440
why be beyond the initial startup what

203
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:46,640
aspects of Music XML have or your um

204
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,360
advocacy of it have led to this the

205
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,000
continued

206
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,839
success well the continued I mean it's

207
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,360
good

208
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,120
technology uh and we know been

209
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,480
continuing to Market in and improve it

210
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,040
we're now working on music XML

211
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,600
4.0 um and a nice thing now is that it's

212
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:09,399
part of the uh it's being maintained in

213
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,920
the worldwide Web Consortium is you know

214
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,959
as a community group we have a music

215
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,560
notation community group which is

216
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,920
independent of make music or recordar I

217
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,959
mean when I was at recordar we were kind

218
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,480
of independent you know it's just a you

219
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,880
know a one in one8 person company very I

220
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,360
had one one very part-time person

221
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,040
helping me so we were sort of like

222
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,320
Switzerland you know the neutral Place

223
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,680
everybody could go to but once I joined

224
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,360
make music forget about it and and

225
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,519
things did not improve with music XML so

226
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,240
Joe berkovitz was very persuasive and

227
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,360
worked on me for many years to uh to

228
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:49,440
transfer music XML from make music uh

229
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,320
ownership to know being maintained in

230
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,760
the worldwide Web Consortium as part of

231
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,399
a community group and my condition on

232
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,399
that was that uh Steinberg also transfer

233
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,959
the smole standard music front layout at

234
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,720
the same time so

235
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:04,360
which they agree to so we have both of

236
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,959
those standards in the w3c music

237
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,440
notation group as well as a Next

238
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:12,920
Generation project called them next

239
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:15,839
which tries to deal with the issue of a

240
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,800
native format and take the you know

241
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,320
we're trying to disrupt music XML from

242
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,959
inside rather than out because if you

243
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,800
don't keep improving formats and

244
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,880
improving Technologies if you think yeah

245
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,079
we're done it's succeeded we can kick

246
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,959
back and relax yeah in a few years your

247
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,079
your toast and so whether you know we've

248
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,680
there have been these awkward

249
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:42,279
transitions from midi one to MIDI 2 from

250
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,480
python 2 to Python 3 HTML 4 to HTML 5 so

251
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:47,519
you know we're trying to manage that as

252
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,519
best we can for what's the next step in

253
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,600
the evolution of of notation

254
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,519
Technologies and be ready for that while

255
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,279
still just keep on on working on

256
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,760
improving music XML for the use cases

257
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:03,240
that it does really really well so you

258
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,880
mentioned uh w3c's uh mnx format and

259
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,160
also that music XML was soon to release

260
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,880
version 4.0 and we see that there there

261
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,560
other notation formats that are not part

262
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,720
of w3c such as Mei and other um more

263
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,760
Niche formats that are continuing to be

264
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,279
developed um why why is music are music

265
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,120
representation formats still being

266
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,880
developed what what are the things that

267
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,519
are that are not totally solved here

268
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,360
well it's not so much that they're

269
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,800
whether they're totally solved it's

270
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,079
having the right tool for the right job

271
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,399
um music XML is optimized for the

272
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,639
exchange

273
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:44,720
between documents it's not optimized for

274
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:47,959
doing editing as in Finale or musicology

275
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,920
as in music21 or assessment as in smart

276
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:53,959
music it's designed for exchange and mnx

277
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,160
is designed more for a native format but

278
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:59,279
that's still going to be you know more

279
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,440
simple applications webbased

280
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,120
applications it's probably not something

281
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,519
where if you wanted to build the next

282
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,920
competitor to finale sellus or Doro you

283
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,279
would use mnx maybe you would but it's

284
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,800
not intended for that level as as you

285
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,720
get more and more sophisticated problems

286
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,399
and more specialized problems you want

287
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,639
your own you know your own abilities to

288
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:25,160
you know you want to optimize things for

289
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,399
those problems so Mei is optimized for

290
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,040
you know they think for the the the

291
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:32,199
issues of musicology I I have

292
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,600
issues with u how they have done that

293
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:37,079
and whether it really serves serves the

294
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,320
community or not but it's a it's a

295
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:41,760
specialized format for for a particular

296
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,880
type of application but nearly anybody

297
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,959
who's developing their own new

298
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,120
application it might be music XML

299
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:50,320
influenced and a lot of them are now you

300
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,199
know they oh okay I can take make if I

301
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,600
cover all these Concepts from music XML

302
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:56,920
I'm probably doing pretty good but it's

303
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,560
not going to look exactly like music XML

304
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,120
I mean smart music is that way the uh

305
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:06,199
the format is very much influenced by

306
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:08,160
music XML but it's not you know music

307
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:10,639
XML inside it's a lot closer to music

308
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,839
XML inside than finale is but it's still

309
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,279
not you know it's a different

310
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,720
format now you mentioned your advisor

311
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:22,399
Barry verco you're an MIT grad You're a

312
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,240
Rat bre rat is that yeah there we

313
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,079
go you're an MIT grad and you're a

314
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,880
supporter of the MIT Music Theater arts

315
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,480
section the leis music music library and

316
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,480
especially Jazz programs so I just want

317
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,560
to ask you um what advice would you give

318
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,040
to MIT students or I suppose students

319
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,800
anywhere who want to combine their love

320
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,360
for computer and their love for music

321
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,040
throughout their life like you yeah

322
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,920
that's that's an interesting question

323
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,440
because everybody has their own path

324
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,160
it's not just me I met my wife in the

325
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:57,759
MIT concert band so uh and we're both uh

326
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,440
lifelong performers so one one thing um

327
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,560
that we found out as an adult it's a lot

328
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,320
easier to have high quality performance

329
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,759
opportunities if you're a singer or a

330
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,360
string player than if you're a brass or

331
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,240
a wind player like we were uh because

332
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,240
there are a lot of really good Community

333
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:17,480
orchestras and choruses but not so many

334
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,199
good really good Community bands so we

335
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,079
switched to singing I switched when I

336
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,199
was 30 and my wife followed a few years

337
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:25,639
later and now we sing together in Opera

338
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,480
courses so you know being able to

339
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,199
maintain you know high quality

340
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,279
performance opportunities is one thing

341
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:35,160
uh if you want to do it for your day job

342
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,480
that's harder because it's a small

343
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,160
industry I mean I spent the first 20

344
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,680
years of my work working like well when

345
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,240
I graduated from MIT there was this was

346
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,720
before midi there was no computer music

347
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,360
industry there was okay there was New

348
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,959
England digital doing some clavas but

349
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,160
outside of that there were you know and

350
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,480
a few other synthesizer things but there

351
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,639
was no computer music industry at the

352
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,600
time so I did usability work for the

353
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,279
first 20 years of my career

354
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,320
and then moved

355
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,160
into uh music software but when I worked

356
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,839
I worked at deck and then I worked at

357
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,160
SAP with a virtual reality startup in

358
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,720
between there but deck and sap those

359
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,680
companies by themselves were way bigger

360
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,560
than the entire music technology

361
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,399
industry so it's hard but you know

362
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:26,560
you're from MIT you do hard things so um

363
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,600
you know connect with people uh do you

364
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,240
know do projects make your projects

365
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,240
