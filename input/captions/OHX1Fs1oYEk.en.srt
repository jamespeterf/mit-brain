1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,960
and good afternoon my name is Tim Moy

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,160
and I'm a recent graduate of the EMA

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,800
program here at MIT Sloan and I'm also

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,599
the co-founder of seab Bio today I'm

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,679
excited to tell you about our technology

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,080
to improve the efficacy of microbial

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,880
products by protecting microbes during

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,039
processing and

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,760
storage now as we all know microbes are

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,760
essential for human health in fact we've

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,080
been able to harness the power of

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,960
naturally occurring microbes to improve

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,680
digestion and Skin Care but that's not

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,320
all their use can be beneficial in a

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,079
wide variety of Industries for example

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,079
improving access to vaccines or in

17
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,000
agriculture fixing key nutrients like

18
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,480
nitrogen or phosphorus for plants or

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,320
even serving as pesticides and in the

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,239
built environment sequestering key

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,960
minerals from the air in fact in some

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,960
chemical processes they've been able to

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,559
reduce the need for Harsh chemicals and

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,840
high temperatures in

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,719
manufacturing but as anyone who's ever

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,120
worked with microbes can tell you they

27
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,839
are incredibly difficult to produce many

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,080
teams of scientists and Engineers can

29
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,720
work for upwards of a decade trying to

30
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,840
identify or engineer new microbes that

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,000
have really good promise with end users

32
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,759
or consumers but the second those

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,400
microbes are exposed to production and

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,360
transportation stresses they

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,240
unfortunately die and companies are

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,600
making those terrible tradeoffs of

37
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,400
either not producing their product

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,400
resulting to the cold supply chain which

39
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,240
is not only costly but not always

40
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,200
available or accepting low yields which

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,680
means really poor performance for their

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,320
consumers I'm proud to introduce a new

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,159
MIT developed technology that protects

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,119
microbes against these extreme

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,159
conditions we've been able to protect

46
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,880
microbes against the drying process

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,280
protect Anor robes from oxygen exposure

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,840
as well as extreme heat and humidity

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,479
what you can see on the bar chart here

50
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,920
is that using our proprietary technology

51
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,719
compared to Conventional excipients when

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,039
our microbes are exposed to temperatures

53
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,479
as high as 50° Cen or even 50% relative

54
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:07,039
humidity we see over six orders of

55
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,080
magnitude or a million times more cell

56
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:10,360
survival and what's really exciting

57
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,440
about our technology is that it's

58
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,200
readily formed in the video here shown

59
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,760
in the lab you can see the formation of

60
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,440
our for uh formula by the solution

61
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,800
turning from clear to dark blue not only

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,080
is it readily formed but the ingredients

63
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,920
are incredibly inexpensive and they're

64
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,680
generally recognized as safe by the

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,239
usfda and most importantly they do not

66
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,519
alter the cellular function that

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,959
companies have worked so hard to

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,800
develop now we know that our technology

69
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,959
is one of many approaches but we believe

70
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,840
it it's the only approach to enable the

71
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,440
widespread adoption of beneficial

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,280
microbes other Technologies can provide

73
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,080
protection but our codings are the

74
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,000
unique combination where they can be

75
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,879
implemented into existing Manufacturing

76
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,480
Systems can provide ambient temperature

77
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,920
storage and higher and are universally

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,720
compatible we've tested these on over 30

79
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,400
different types of string

80
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,560
and what's more is they're incredibly

81
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,319
inexpensive they're over a 100 times

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,799
cheaper than the next competitive

83
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,239
technology and at seab bio we see

84
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,480
ourselves as partners in enabling the

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,560
use of beneficial microbes and we're

86
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,400
looking for companies both domestic and

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,599
Global that are either looking to

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,120
manufacture or improve their existing

89
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:24,760
microbial products what this looks like

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,640
is we start with an intake meeting where

91
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,000
we learn about the key stressors that

92
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,959
your microbial products are exposed to

93
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,959
and then jointly develop a custom coding

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,480
for your product and ultimately what

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,720
this means is that you can get to new

96
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,799
product improvements launching new

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,560
products as well as developing those

98
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,159
hard-hitting claims that allow you to

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,760
maintain your industry leadership in

100
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,360
fact with one of our partners we've been

101
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,760
able to extend the shelf life of their

102
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,200
product by over six months and with

103
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,120
another we've been able to remove the

104
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,319
need for using 4 degree temperature

105
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,040
storage so if any of these benefits

106
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,439
sound exciting to you my contact

107
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,640
information is below and as I mentioned

108
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,439
here it say a bio our mission is really

109
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,439
to enable the full potential of microbes

110
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:07,000
in everyday life and I'm happy to take

111
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:10,239
any questions now or in the breakout

112
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,599
rooms team thank you so much so you've

113
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,159
talked a little about um ACTC consumer

114
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,040
products and Therapeutics at some of the

115
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:22,479
um vertical can you give a more specific

116
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,080
example of um how you've um worked with

117
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,080
one or had conversations whatever you

118
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,759
can share yeah so typically those that

119
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,720
are working with microbial products You

120
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:32,759
Know Who You Are um what we typically

121
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,400
like to understand is what is the strain

122
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,639
what are the stressors and then we work

123
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,280
to build a sort of a work plan and sort

124
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,600
of proof of concept study uh that can we

125
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,800
that we can use to demonstrate the

126
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,759
efficacy of our product and how long

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,680
could that take how what's the variation

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,560
yeah and so typically we've seen this go

129
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,759
from anywhere from 4 to 12 weeks it's

130
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,240
actually a really quick process um but

131
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,280
unfortunately we're unable to speed up

132
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,720
the stability process so if you need one

133
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,960
year of stability unfortunately it might

134
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,639
take a year of time um but we are really

135
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,240
quick and it and we've seen a lot of

136
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,240
success with our partners
