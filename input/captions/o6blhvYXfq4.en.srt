1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,880
So let me tell you about zero sum games.

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,400
Uh let me start off with the key

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,000
definition

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,640
and we're going to study what happens

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,320
under the simple definition. So first

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,160
let me tell you the abstraction and then

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,800
we'll do some examples to try and make

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,240
it concrete. So specifically, we'll be

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,240
interested in what's called a two-player

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,000
zero sum game.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,200
And a two-player zero sum game has a few

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,760
components. So it's described by the

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,680
following things.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,239
First of all, there's a row player.

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,199
A lot of times we'll call this player

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:02,680
Alice.

17
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,680
And Alice has m different strategies.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,360
These are the moves that she's allowed

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,680
to make in the game we're playing.

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,040
There's a second player which is called

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,520
the column player.

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,119
And usually we call the column player

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,400
Bob.

24
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:24,080
These are just the standard conventions.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,240
And Bob is going to have n strategies.

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,000
So already you can see that the game

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,080
looks different for the two players.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,840
They have even different action spaces

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,479
of what they're allowed to make as a

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,360
move in the game. And the crucial thing

31
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,520
is the last component which tells us

32
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,600
what are the outcomes of the game. Who

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,479
pays who how much depending on what

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,960
strategies you play. So finally what we

35
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:53,399
have is we have an M byN matrix which is

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,399
called the payoff matrix.

37
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,119
And we'll call this C. And the way that

38
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:06,960
this matrix C works is that the entry CI

39
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:09,039
J is the amount that the row player i.e.

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,200
Alice

41
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,400
gets

42
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,120
in payment from

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,120
the column player.

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,200
if they play

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,800
I and J respectively.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,680
So notice that the row player Alice has

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,120
M strategies and there are M rows in

48
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,879
this matrix. The column player Bob has n

49
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,959
strategies and there are n columns in

50
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,040
this matrix. So you should think of this

51
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,519
payoff matrix as being indexed by their

52
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,599
strategy set. Every choice of a strategy

53
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,000
for the row player just selects which

54
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,760
row we're interested in.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,200
Every strategy for the column player

56
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,160
just selects which column we're

57
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,959
interested in. And then we look into

58
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,599
that entry in the matrix and that

59
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,920
describes the net payment from Bob to

60
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,680
Alice. That payment could be negative in

61
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,319
which case the money goes from Alice to

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,200
Bob. But in any case, right now in the

63
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,760
case of a zero sum game, we only have a

64
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,159
single payoff matrix that describes you

65
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,319
know what happens. And it's called a

66
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,640
zero- sum game because if you add up the

67
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,280
wins and losses of Alice and Bob, it's

68
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,040
zero. So of course you can consider more

69
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,040
general games and we'll talk more about

70
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,280
that towards the end, but this will be

71
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,200
our basic abstraction.

72
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,680
So let's see some examples to get some

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,720
intuition for this. There's a very

74
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,040
simple example that

75
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,519
can get us started. This is called the

76
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,519
matching pennies

77
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,519
game.

78
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,040
So the way that this works is that Alice

79
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,040
and Bob

80
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,239
simultaneously

81
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,239
choose

82
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,000
either

83
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,200
H or T.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,519
So in particular their strategy space M=

85
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,360
N equals 2. They only have two choices

86
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,200
of actions. They can choose either heads

87
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,120
or tails.

88
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,359
And now what we have to do is describe

89
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:23,040
what the payoffs are. So if they match,

90
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:29,600
if these two coins match, then you know

91
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:34,800
Alice gets $1 from Bob and otherwise if

92
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,320
they don't match then Alice pays Bob $1

93
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,199
instead.

94
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,919
Right? So this is a very simple example

95
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,680
of a zero- sum game. In fact, we can

96
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,360
write it in this formalization that I

97
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,320
described right here just by writing

98
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,160
down what the payoff matrix is. So in

99
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:55,639
this case, the payoff matrix is just a

100
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,639
2x two matrix. And in particular,

101
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,880
it'll look like this

102
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,720
one -1 -1 1 where we have some

103
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,120
conventions

104
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,600
of what the different rows map to in

105
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,919
terms of the strategies. So the first

106
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,440
row maps to the choice of Alice choosing

107
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,600
heads.

108
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,639
The second row maps the choice of Alice

109
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,039
choosing tails. And then similarly for

110
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,039
Bob but for the columns. And so the

111
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,080
entries in this matrix just describe the

112
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,080
payoffs of this game. So let's make sure

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,720
we have you know the right intuition for

114
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,080
this. So let's think about this zero sum

115
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,240
game. Uh which player has an advantage

116
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,759
if any? So, who would you want to be if

117
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,320
you got to choose to either be the row

118
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,400
or the column player or would it not

119
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,919
really matter?

120
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,960
Just asking for your intuition.

121
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,199
>> Yeah. Doesn't matter.

122
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,680
>> Doesn't matter. Why?

123
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,320
>> I mean, because it's it's the same

124
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,880
payoff for

125
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,280
>> Yeah, that's right. So, you know, this

126
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,039
is very intuitive that neither of these

127
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,039
players has an advantage. It doesn't

128
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,919
matter if you're tasked with playing the

129
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,919
role of Alice or Bob, right? But for

130
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,120
more complicated games, it's maybe not

131
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,800
so obvious who has an advantage. And

132
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,120
this is where we're going to use ideas

133
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,520
from linear programming to try and

134
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,520
understand who actually has an advantage

135
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,080
and in what sense do they have an

136
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,319
advantage? So maybe for simple games,

137
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,000
it's easy to reason about them just by

138
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,160
staring at them and figuring out who

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
you'd rather be. But for more

140
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,039
complicated games, maybe it's not so

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,560
simple. So let's do a more interesting

142
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,720
example.

143
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,319
Uh and we'll come back to this example

144
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,240
later on once we've developed the

145
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,560
theory.

146
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,160
So let me just write down the payoff

147
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,199
matrix.

148
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,280
So let's say our payoff matrix C is a

149
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,680
3x3 matrix. So each Alice and Bob have

150
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,600
three different strategies. But now the

151
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,360
game won't be symmetric in such an

152
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,520
obvious way.

153
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,520
So the payoffs are going to look like

154
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,520
this.

155
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:13,680
So Alice can either choose the strategy,

156
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:18,080
let's say A1, A2 or A3. Bob can choose

157
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,560
the strategy B1, B2, and B3. And as

158
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,800
before, the entries in this matrix

159
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,400
describe the payoff of one player to

160
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,880
another.

161
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,840
So let me get some volunteers. So, who

162
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,800
wants to play this game?

163
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:38,199
I need two volunteers.

164
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,199
Yeah, come on down. Anyone else?

165
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,840
No one else wants to be on camera? I'm

166
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,840
going to select someone.

167
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:51,005
[laughter]

168
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,240
Don't be shy.

169
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,280
You guys brought some money with you,

170
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,120
right? No. Okay, that's all right. I'll

171
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,120
spot you.

172
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,400
I have these convenient baggies of

173
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,400
Monopoly money. So, uh, what I want you

174
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,400
to think about

175
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,400
is

176
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,319
in this game, who do you think has the

177
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,319
advantage? So, the row or the column

178
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,319
player?

179
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,800
And can we make predictions about, you

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,759
know, if they play rationally, what

181
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,719
their strategies ought to converge to? I

182
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,880
think this isn't so obvious, but uh let

183
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,760
me start with you. So, who do you want

184
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,760
to be, Alice or Bob?

185
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,360
>> You want to be Alice? All right.

186
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,120
I'm afraid you're stuck with Bob. All

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,120
right. So, what I'm going to have you

188
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:01,040
guys do is, you know, grab some chalk

189
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:04,240
and I'm going to ask you guys to write

190
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:08,480
down uh which strategy you pick. You

191
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,080
know, A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3. Hide your

192
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
answers from the other person so they

193
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,839
don't see it. And then we'll reveal them

194
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,519
simultaneously and figure out who's

195
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,760
doing better. So, we'll play a few

196
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,320
rounds of the game. So, pick a spot on

197
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,040
the board and uh you know figure out

198
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,760
based on the payoff matrix

199
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,480
um you know what exactly you want to

200
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,000
play and we'll see how we do.

201
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,880
>> Yeah. Why don't you use this one so that

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,160
you guys uh Yeah.

203
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,160
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

204
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,301
>> You can ask the audience for help too if

205
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,320
you want.

206
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:46,720
[laughter]

207
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,839
Uh oh. Don't.

208
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,320
>> Yeah. Maybe cover it up.

209
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,800
Yeah.

210
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,080
Okay. Are you guys ready?

211
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:02,720
>> All right. Reveal your answers.

212
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:05,680
B1 and A1. All right. So, uh Alice,

213
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,920
congratulations. You win $2. Can you pay

214
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,920
the lady?

215
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,120
All right, let's do another round since

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,720
maybe you guys are just getting the hang

217
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,200
of it. All right, so uh think hard. Last

218
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,279
time she played A1, so maybe you want to

219
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,040
change your strategy. I don't know. It's

220
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,959
up to you. Um A1 worked out pretty well.

221
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,640
I don't know if you want to change. So

222
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,640
think hard and then write down your

223
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,640
answer.

224
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,880
Okay.

225
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:59,592
So, we've got uh A1

226
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,440
and B2. So, you owe him a dollar now.

227
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:04,160
[laughter]

228
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,480
>> Uh he's learning.

229
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,240
You're still up, but uh now some of your

230
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,320
winnings are going away. Let's do

231
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,720
another round. What do you guys want to

232
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,720
play this time?

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,920
Okay. All right. So, let's see. B3 and

234
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,920
A2.

235
00:11:31,032 --> 00:11:35,279
[laughter]

236
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,680
You lose three more dollars. Uh

237
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,279
>> oh. [laughter]

238
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,839
>> How much do I have?

239
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,360
>> You have seven total.

240
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,680
>> You're going to go bust soon, though, if

241
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,839
you keep [clears throat] it up.

242
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,519
All right, let's do another round. Let's

243
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,079
give her a chance to get back on top.

244
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,079
All right. Uh, so write down your next

245
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,079
strategy.

246
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,920
Okay. B3 and A1.

247
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,663
All right. So, Oh,

248
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,663
she just won it all back. [laughter]

249
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,560
>> All right. So, you guys are pretty close

250
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,480
to even. Uh, so let me just test your

251
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,000
guys intuition. You're not necessarily

252
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,680
supposed to have intuition about this

253
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,240
yet. So, after seeing them play, right?

254
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,240
Um, who thinks Alice has the better

255
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,240
deal?

256
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,200
You have to vote for something.

257
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,600
It's okay if you're wrong. We'll build

258
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,560
up intuition as we're going along. Who

259
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,279
thinks Bob has the better deal?

260
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,839
All right, let's try that again. I got a

261
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,880
grand total of like two votes. Who

262
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,560
thinks Alice has the better deal?

263
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,880
All right, who thinks Bob has a better

264
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,200
deal? All right, so pretty mixed. All

265
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,440
right, so thanks for your help and uh we

266
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,040
can, you know, figure out the theory of

267
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,279
how zero sum games work and we're going

268
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,480
to be able to answer this question. But,

269
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,920
you know, for things like matching

270
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,680
pennies, as I told you, it's very

271
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,920
intuitive. You guys all got the right

272
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,079
answer about who has an advantage.

273
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,920
They're both the same. But as soon as

274
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,160
you move to bigger games, and this isn't

275
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,720
even much bigger. This is just a 3x3

276
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,200
game. you know already it's not so

277
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,480
obvious who has the advantage. So one of

278
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,639
the things that we're going to do at the

279
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,000
very end of lecture is we're going to

280
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:33,120
talk about really gigantic games which I

281
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,800
could never even write down on the board

282
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,720
because there are all kinds of games

283
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,519
that show up in things like you know

284
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,959
advertising for presidential elections.

285
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,440
Maybe you want to figure out, you know,

286
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,040
how to allocate your total advertising

287
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,839
budget across a whole bunch of

288
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,399
battleground states to figure out how to

289
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,480
win the most electoral votes. These are

290
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,519
exactly the kinds of things that can and

291
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,880
are modeled as gigantic zero sum games.

292
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,880
And we're going to develop the theory

293
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,279
for how to think about these things. So,

294
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,720
it's good that we don't have intuition

295
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,399
because, you know, we can make progress.

296
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,959
All right. So, let me introduce a little

297
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,959
bit more terminology.

298
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,480
Let me tell you, you know, what it means

299
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,880
to solve a game. And there'll actually

300
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,720
be a few different notions of how to

301
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,440
solve games, and they'll all behave a

302
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,000
little bit differently. So, the easiest

303
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:29,480
concept to wrap your head around is

304
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,480
called a pure Nash equilibrium.

305
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,839
So this is a concept that you know makes

306
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,399
sense regardless of whether the game is

307
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,800
zero sum or not. You know for general

308
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,440
two-player games I could have two payoff

309
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,920
matrices. One of which that describes

310
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,399
what Alice wins and one of which

311
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,240
describes what Bob wins but it's not

312
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,440
necessarily a transfer of money from one

313
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,440
to the other. So uh a lot of the things

314
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,720
we're doing though the only way to think

315
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,720
about it as a linear program will be if

316
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,480
we're working in the zero sum game even

317
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,639
though this concept makes sense more

318
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:12,040
generally. So what is a Nash

319
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,040
equilibrium? It's a pair of strategies

320
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,320
I J. So this means that the row player

321
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,160
plays I the column player plays J. And

322
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,320
it has the following property which I'll

323
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,279
just describe informally but then we'll

324
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,800
make it mathematically precise. It has

325
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,800
the property that no player

326
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,519
has any incentive to deviate.

327
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,360
How many people have seen the movie a

328
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,600
beautiful mind?

329
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,399
It butchered this concept. So please do

330
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,720
not get that definition from that movie.

331
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,079
Um so we'll do the correct definition

332
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,040
here. So what do I mean by incentive to

333
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,440
deviate? Let me turn this into a set of

334
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,600
linear inequalities. That way we can

335
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,360
think about it in a more mathematically

336
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:12,320
precise way. What I claim is that the

337
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,759
row player, if he's playing strategy I

338
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,920
and the column player is playing

339
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:23,000
strategy J, then the row player

340
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,000
has no incentive to deviate

341
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:34,160
if and only if

342
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:35,680
for all I prime CI prime J as at most

343
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,040
CI.

344
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,880
So the way to think about this

345
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,360
inequality is that the column player has

346
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,720
already committed to J. That's what we

347
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,120
mean by J being a pure Nash equilibrium

348
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,519
is that row player has decided I'm going

349
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,680
to play I. He's even announced it. I'm

350
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,639
playing I. The column player has

351
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,639
announced I'm playing J2. And even with

352
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,199
that knowledge of what the other player

353
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,279
is doing, they still can't do strictly

354
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,679
better than what their current strategy

355
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,520
is. So if the column player has

356
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,520
announced that they're playing J, the

357
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,079
only thing that's relevant is the J

358
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,559
column of our payoff matrix. This would

359
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,640
be the payoff if the row player sticks

360
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,360
to his current strategy. He still plays

361
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,520
the strategy he announced, strategy I.

362
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,319
And hypothetically, if instead he

363
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,600
changed to another strategy, I prime,

364
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,720
the claim is that he doesn't get uh any

365
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:34,080
more money, any positive win from making

366
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,919
that deviation. So he might tie in terms

367
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,400
of changing to another strategy, but he

368
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:43,080
doesn't do strictly better.

369
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,080
And similarly for the column player

370
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:56,240
has no incentive to deviate if and only

371
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:59,679
if for all J prime CI J prime is at

372
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,720
least CI J. Now just to make sure people

373
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,960
are paying attention, right? So here

374
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,240
obviously the deviation is happening

375
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,880
over the choice of I versus I prime.

376
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,000
Here the deviation is happening over the

377
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,799
choice of J prime versus J. Why are my

378
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,440
inequalities flipped here?

379
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,679
Why is my notion of no no incentive to

380
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,080
deviate? a less than or equal to

381
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,720
constraint here when I change I to I

382
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,960
prime and why is it a greater than equal

383
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,760
to constraint when I change J to J

384
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,799
prime.

385
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,679
>> Yeah,

386
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:39,840
>> if the payoff is like the players

387
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,280
>> exactly that's right. So really the

388
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,960
payoff for the column player is just

389
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,400
negative of this. So when I multiply

390
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,039
through by minus one everything

391
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,880
switches. So this is a very natural

392
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,400
notion. This is called a pure Nash

393
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,960
equilibrium.

394
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,320
But already we can see some deficiencies

395
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,640
of pure Nash equilibrium. Right? So even

396
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,080
if we come back to this matching pennies

397
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:05,080
game, right? So is there a pure Nash

398
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,080
equilibrium?

399
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,799
What do you guys think?

400
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,960
I see someone shaking their head in the

401
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,960
correct direction.

402
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,320
>> No, there isn't. Can you tell us why?

403
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,960
Any intuition?

404
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,320
>> I guess if

405
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,679
if I'm the broke player, um I always

406
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,280
want to choose one that'll give me one

407
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,280
and then if the tails person like

408
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,799
switches their uh strategy, they'll

409
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,880
switch the other one. That's right.

410
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,880
That's right. That's exactly right. Let

411
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,360
me just rephrase it slightly. You know,

412
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,679
Nash, a pure Nash equilibrium, you know,

413
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,600
corresponds to announcing what your

414
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,080
strategies are publicly and still there

415
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,840
being no reason to switch, right? So,

416
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,000
whatever those strategies are, imagine

417
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,320
that Alice announces she's going to play

418
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,960
heads. Bob announces he's going to play

419
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,039
heads. So, then who has the incentive to

420
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,880
deviate? Bob. He doesn't want the

421
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,640
pennies to match. So if he deviates the

422
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,039
tails, then he's going to win a dollar

423
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,200
and he'll do strictly better. And that's

424
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:19,039
true for any particular starting

425
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,760
configuration. There's always one player

426
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,600
who has an incentive to deviate.

427
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,080
So unfortunately, there's no pure Nash

428
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,080
equilibrium. Right? Now, even though

429
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,919
there wasn't the pure Nash equilibrium,

430
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,480
we can already intuitively see the way

431
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,520
the game would be played. Maybe Alice

432
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,360
and Bob just choose randomly, right? And

433
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,120
that would be pretty good because an

434
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,400
expectation they would win no money. And

435
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,120
that's probably the best that they can

436
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,520
do. But for this type of game, you might

437
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,440
have the intuition that I cooked this up

438
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,919
in such a way that again there's no pure

439
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,159
Nash equilibrium. So when there is a

440
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,960
pure Nash, it becomes very obvious, you

441
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,799
know, how to play for the most part. Um,

442
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,520
but when there's no pure Nash

443
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,400
equilibrium, all of a sudden you have to

444
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,320
ask, you know, how you should play. And

445
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,960
the key point is that maybe the notion

446
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,039
of playing shouldn't necessarily be a

447
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,480
deterministic choice.

448
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,880
Because the problem is that when you

449
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,960
make deterministic choices, you can't

450
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,000
commit in a way where you never have an

451
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,320
incentive to deviate. So this takes us

452
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,679
to you know the next notion which will

453
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,559
be critical for us which is uh you know

454
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,720
a finer grain notion of an equilibrium

455
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,240
which is called a mixed Nash

456
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,919
equilibrium.

457
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,440
Basically it's one which allows

458
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,200
randomization.

459
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,480
So let me define it. This will be the

460
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:43,559
key thing that we talk about today.

461
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,559
So a mixed nash equilibrium

462
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,200
[snorts]

463
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,720
is a pair

464
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,120
but now this pair is going to mean

465
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,440
something different. So it's a pair XY

466
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,120
with and I'll tell you what this means

467
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,360
in a second. X belonging to delta M.

468
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,960
I'll tell you what that means. Y

469
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,840
belonging to delta N.

470
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:18,240
Again with the property that

471
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:23,000
no player has an incentive to deviate

472
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,000
has a positive incentive to deviate.

473
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,000
So I have to tell you what this notation

474
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:35,960
delta subm means. And what this means is

475
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,960
just a distribution

476
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:45,280
on the set M. So the way to think about

477
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,880
it equivalently is that you know X is a

478
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,039
vector

479
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:54,400
that has non- negative entries

480
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:57,919
and the sum of all of these X I from I=

481
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,320
1 to M is equal to one. That's what the

482
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,520
constraint is. So what's going on is

483
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:07,200
that instead of the row player choosing

484
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,960
one fixed strategy like strategy I, he's

485
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,679
going to randomize over different

486
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,720
strategies. And the probability that he

487
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:17,039
puts on each different strategy is given

488
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,080
by the associated coordinate of this

489
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,799
corresponding vector x. So when I write

490
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,799
x belonging to delta m, keep in mind

491
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,480
that this is really a set of linear

492
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,760
inequalities, which is great because

493
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,159
we've been talking about linear

494
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,720
programs. It's just the constraint that

495
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,320
x is an m- dimensional vector. All of

496
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,559
its coordinates are non- negative and

497
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,880
they sum to one.

498
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,520
Same thing is happening here except with

499
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,400
the fact that it's a distribution on n

500
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,320
not m because the column player is

501
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,240
randomizing over the choice of which of

502
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,000
the n columns because that's the number

503
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,400
of strategies.

504
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,880
So this is the same basic idea as a pure

505
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,200
nash equilibrium. We still have this

506
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,280
notion that no player has an incentive

507
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,000
to deviate

508
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:05,120
but uh now we're augmenting the set of

509
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,320
strategies right. So instead of me

510
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,080
announcing I'm playing strategy I and

511
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,120
you announcing you're playing strategy

512
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,120
J, I'll instead announce that I'm going

513
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,159
to sample my strategies from the

514
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,760
distribution X. And you will announce

515
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,159
that you're going to sample your

516
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,159
strategies from the distribution Y. And

517
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,320
we can ask even after you make that

518
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,200
announcement if you have any incentive

519
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,279
to change up your strategies. So let's

520
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,480
be a bit more precise about you know

521
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:37,679
what exactly I mean by no incentive to

522
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,159
deviate because this will come up later

523
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,000
when we do the proof of you know a very

524
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,880
powerful theorem I'm going to cover very

525
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,120
soon. So you know what does it mean for

526
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,200
the role player to have no incentive to

527
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,799
deviate now when we're talking about

528
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,840
randomized strategies.

529
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:59,520
Well let's first do the following. So

530
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:02,520
first of all the expected

531
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,520
payoff

532
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,240
to the row player

533
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:17,679
is the sum over J = 1 to M. The sum oh

534
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:27,120
sorry I

535
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:30,080
I= 1 to M J = 1 to N of CI J X I Y J

536
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:33,600
and in matrix vector notation this is

537
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,880
just the quadratic form of X and Y on

538
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,279
this payoff matrix C. So all I'm doing

539
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,440
is I'm saying all right you've announced

540
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,080
that you know you're playing strategy X

541
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,760
and you're playing strategy Y. The first

542
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,480
thing I could care about once you've

543
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,039
announced that those are your strategies

544
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,640
is, you know, how much does Alice win in

545
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,720
expectation.

546
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,440
And this is a very simple, you know,

547
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,159
probistic computation because all this

548
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,159
is is it's the probability that Alice

549
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,640
plays strategy I because that's given by

550
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,960
the I coordinate of X times the

551
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,799
probability that Bob plays strategy J.

552
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,880
They sample their strategies from their

553
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,400
distribution independently.

554
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,039
And then this is whatever the payoff

555
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,600
would be. So this is just computing the

556
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,240
expected value, the expected winnings

557
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,799
that Alice has. And in our case, it

558
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,919
works out to a very nice expression in

559
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:28,400
terms of vectors and matrices.

560
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,640
But now we can talk about what it means

561
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,360
for the row player to have no incentive

562
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,279
to deviate. Right? So in this case, when

563
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,919
the row player is playing a randomized

564
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:42,880
strategy, what I claim is that the row

565
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:46,200
player has no incentive

566
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,200
to deviate

567
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:59,760
if and only if for all I prime the sum

568
00:26:52,320 --> 00:27:04,799
from J = 1 to N of C I prime J Y is at

569
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,400
most XRPOSE C Y so what's going on with

570
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,159
this expression there's a reason I'm

571
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,960
taking a little bit to build up towards

572
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,120
it right you should see that already it

573
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,440
bears some similarity with what's going

574
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,000
on here where the inequality is less

575
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,760
than or equal to but I'm allowing some

576
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,919
variation because I'm changing my

577
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,559
strategy from my strategy X that has

578
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,559
this payoff on the right hand side to

579
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,039
instead being the strategy that just

580
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:33,679
selects I prime.

581
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:36,799
So this is really calculating what would

582
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:40,559
happen if I play according to X against

583
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:43,919
Y versus I decide I'm going to just play

584
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,880
strategy I prime against the strategy

585
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,039
YJ. So what's going on right here in

586
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,360
this expression is it's the same

587
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,919
expected value computation. Bob is still

588
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,120
playing according to Y and this is the

589
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,120
probability that Bob selects strategy J.

590
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,520
But Alice is now deviating to the

591
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,840
strategy I prime. So she always selects

592
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,720
strategy I prime and this is her

593
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,520
expected payoff and I want that this

594
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,679
expected payoff is less than or equal to

595
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,960
what I would get if I just stuck to my

596
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,039
pre-announced strategy. So even though

597
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,279
you know you can interpret this as a

598
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,799
system of linear inequalities, it's

599
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,880
important to be able to translate this

600
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:27,760
back into words to understand what it's

601
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:29,360
modeling. So does this make sense?

602
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,200
Yeah.

603
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,120
All right.

604
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,320
So, let's talk about the column player

605
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,320
and then I'm going to ask you a

606
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,320
question,

607
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:47,360
a somewhat tricky question

608
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:50,760
that'll be good food for later.

609
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,760
So similarly

610
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:59,240
the column player

611
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,240
has no incentive to deviate.

612
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:12,480
If and only if for all I prime the sum

613
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:17,679
from J equals 1 to N C oh sorry sum or

614
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:22,399
for all J prime the sum from I = 1 to M

615
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:25,600
of CI J prime X I is greater than or

616
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,600
equal to the payoff.

617
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,520
So this works the same way. You know

618
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,080
Alice is just dev uh Bob is just

619
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,840
deviating to a single strategy J prime.

620
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,799
The inequality gets flipped because the

621
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,720
payments are going to Alice not to Bob.

622
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,679
But this is what it means at least. This

623
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,480
is how to turn this definition of a mix

624
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,960
Nash equilibrium into a system of linear

625
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,679
inequalities.

626
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,159
Now let me ask a diagnostic question.

627
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,000
Right?

628
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,480
So the way that I've defined it, you

629
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,480
know, these inequalities,

630
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,559
they capture

631
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:09,039
deviating

632
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:12,520
from a randomized strategy, but to a

633
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,520
pure strategy.

634
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,520
Why not

635
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,320
allow

636
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,320
more general deviations?

637
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,559
Okay. So the way to think about this is

638
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,600
when I defined the notion of incentive

639
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,760
to deviate right here, you started off

640
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,120
with a strategy I and you considered

641
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,679
what would happen if you deviate to a

642
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,799
strategy I prime. So you started off

643
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,039
with a deterministic strategy I and you

644
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,880
deviated to another deterministic

645
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:55,679
strategy I prime.

646
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,520
Here I define the notion of a mixed Nash

647
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,240
equilibrium in terms of the players

648
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,919
having randomized strategies.

649
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Alice is announcing that she plays

650
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,039
according to X. Bob is announcing he

651
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,320
plays according to Y. But my notion of

652
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:13,120
deviation was just Alice deviating from

653
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,960
her randomized strategy X to a

654
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:19,440
deterministic strategy I prime.

655
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,000
Bob's notion of deviation was deviating

656
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,279
from a randomized strategy Y to a

657
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,520
deterministic strategy J prime. So why

658
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:31,159
didn't I consider deviations to

659
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,159
randomize strategies?

660
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,960
This is an important concept and we'll

661
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,600
see it a few times in the lecture.

662
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,600
Anyone have any intuition?

663
00:31:52,799 --> 00:32:00,240
I claim it's the same.

664
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,240
So imagine that

665
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,360
Alice had a deviation to some other

666
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,320
randomized strategy XP prime that did

667
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,799
better. What I claim is the only way

668
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,120
that she has a deviation to an X prime

669
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,200
that does better is if there's some

670
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,320
fixed deterministic strategy that does

671
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,799
better too. because how well she does

672
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,320
when I take X and replace it with X

673
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:27,039
prime is just an average of how well she

674
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,159
does for each of the different row

675
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:34,760
strategies she can take.

676
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:34,760
So this is a very important concept

677
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,559
and what I'm claiming here purely game

678
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,880
theoretically is that you know if Bob

679
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,919
has pre-announced that his strategy is Y

680
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,320
and he's committed to that then I don't

681
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,919
have an incentive to deviate to I have

682
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,640
an incentive to deviate to some

683
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,360
randomized X-pime if and only if there's

684
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,000
a fixed deterministic strategy I prime

685
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,159
that I have an incentive to deviate

686
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,919
So it's not totally obvious, but

687
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,000
hopefully it'll become clear over the

688
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,760
course of the lecture. That's really a

689
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,360
statement that has to do with weak

690
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,960
duality.

691
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,640
So when we talked about linear

692
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,600
programming and we talked about weak and

693
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,519
strong duality, this is really, as we'll

694
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,760
see, the crux of what's going on. And

695
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,000
there's a view to think about, you know,

696
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,440
what weak duality is that happens purely

697
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,360
through zero sum games. So in fact the

698
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,960
starting point of understanding linear

699
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,279
programs was actually zero sum games. So

700
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,080
it happened with vonoman's famous work

701
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,880
and it was of course famously you know

702
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,519
augmented to not necessarily zero sum

703
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,360
games by Nash. But this is really how

704
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,720
people first thought about the concepts

705
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,120
of weak and strong duality. So now I get

706
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,480
to tell you about uh probably my

707
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,480
favorite theorem in class.

708
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,919
Let me write it up here.

709
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,799
This is an amazing result which you know

710
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,639
we will prove today. Uh but the depth of

711
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,119
this result

712
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:14,079
I think you appreciate more and more

713
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,960
over time because of how many amazing

714
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,440
consequences it has.

715
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,679
So this is something called the minmax

716
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:27,159
theorem

717
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,159
and it was proven by vonoman.

718
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,280
Let me just write it down as a

719
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,639
mathematical statement. There's some

720
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:39,599
value lambda star which is equal to the

721
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:41,839
max overall x belonging to delta m of

722
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:46,800
the min

723
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:50,399
overall y belonging to delta n of xrpose

724
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:53,839
c y. But I claim that this is actually

725
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,480
the same thing as

726
00:34:53,839 --> 00:35:01,599
switching the max and the min. So the

727
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:05,920
min overall y in delta n the max over

728
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:10,240
all x in delta m of the same thing

729
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,160
xrpose c y. So this is my favorite

730
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,720
theorem in the entire class we're going

731
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,119
to cover.

732
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,920
So what this statement is even saying

733
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,000
and why it's so deep and powerful this

734
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,240
takes a little bit to digest. So let's

735
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,079
go through that right now.

736
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,200
So right now all I said it's called

737
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:31,920
vonoyman's minax theorem is that these

738
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,800
two things are the same interchanging

739
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,800
the max and the min.

740
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,359
Okay. And I'm going to call these two

741
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,359
expressions one and two. So let's

742
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,240
interpret this expression game

743
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,400
theoretically

744
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,200
in terms of what the semantics are for

745
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,200
these two different expressions.

746
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,960
So what does this result imply?

747
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,320
Well, what I claim is that it's really

748
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,839
telling us that two different ways to

749
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,640
play the game, actually three different

750
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,079
ways, are all equivalent. It doesn't

751
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,040
matter.

752
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,839
So, expression one where I have a max

753
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,520
and then a min, right? I claim that

754
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:29,280
what's going on with the way that I've

755
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,200
ordered the max and the min is that it's

756
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,320
a certain semantics for how the game is

757
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,960
played, which sounds like it's unfair to

758
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:41,960
the column player. Because what's going

759
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,960
on is that the column player

760
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,800
chooses

761
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,800
a distribution

762
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,680
on strategies

763
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,320
announces it

764
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,839
and the row player best response.

765
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,000
Did I get these backwards? One second.

766
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,320
I think it it's backwards. All right,

767
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:35,760
let's do two. Okay, so what's going on

768
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,720
in expression two is that um you know,

769
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:42,480
first we have this outer minim.

770
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,480
So first this uh oh wait, uh let's see.

771
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,880
Nope, I had it right the first time. My

772
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,320
mistake. All right.

773
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,520
Doesn't matter whe they're equivalent,

774
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,640
but let's just make sure we get the

775
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,800
parsing correct. Right? So imagine that

776
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,240
I take that expression, I cover up the

777
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,400
max first in my expression one. So

778
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,200
what's going on is that the column

779
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,240
player is playing this min strategy. So

780
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,599
he's trying to find this uh you know

781
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,280
this strategy Y that's a distribution on

782
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:14,160
columns.

783
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:17,839
But now once he's chosen what that

784
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,400
strategy is, right? Once he's chosen

785
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:23,760
what that strategy is, then the max

786
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:27,119
player is allowed to choose the best

787
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,599
response. So even after the column

788
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,400
player is fixed and committed to playing

789
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:35,520
Y, then the row player chooses the

790
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,280
strategy X that maximizes it. I'm going

791
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,000
to get this slightly. Yeah, let me just

792
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,000
make sure I got these things right.

793
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Uh,

794
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,280
yeah.

795
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,760
All right. I might have gotten it

796
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,320
backwards, but that's okay.

797
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:03,160
And for strategy two, it'll be the same,

798
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,160
but the row player goes first.

799
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,880
So the way to think about it is that you

800
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,280
know if the way that I described the

801
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,200
semantics of the game to begin with

802
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,520
started with one of the players having

803
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,079
to pre-commit to their strategy app

804
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,320
priori that would have sounded like I

805
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:25,760
really changed who had an advantage

806
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,560
right because now you know it has to be

807
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,960
that Alice is going first or Bob is

808
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,359
going first that person has to commit to

809
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,720
what their randomized strategy is. See,

810
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,960
the way to think about it is that when

811
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,200
we just had the notion of a pure Nash

812
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,119
equilibrium, then all of a sudden,

813
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,200
changing the order that the two players

814
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,680
play completely changes the meaning of

815
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,960
the game. So, think about the matching

816
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,640
pennies example. If Alice goes first,

817
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,800
you definitely want to be Bob because

818
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,640
whatever Alice chooses, you can choose

819
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,119
the penny to not match and then you

820
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:59,760
always win a dollar. So when you're

821
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,160
committing to deterministic strategies,

822
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,920
there's a huge advantage to who commits

823
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,440
first to their strategy and who gets to

824
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,359
adapt.

825
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,640
But what we're saying here is that it

826
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:12,480
actually doesn't matter who goes first.

827
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,960
That the best that you can do in either

828
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,800
of these two scenarios where Alice

829
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,680
pre-commits to her distribution then Bob

830
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:23,760
goes or vice versa is actually the same

831
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,400
value. It's the value lambda star.

832
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,720
So in fact what this uh you know minimax

833
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,560
theorem is really telling us is that

834
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,720
these two ways of playing the game and

835
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,240
even the way where we simultaneously

836
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,480
choose what our distribution on

837
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,160
strategies are are all completely

838
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,480
equivalent.

839
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,800
So this may not yet seem like a very

840
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,200
powerful result but um I'll give you

841
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,480
some more intuition later

842
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,599
but for right now let's um let's prove

843
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,200
you know one very powerful thing.

844
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,960
So when I talked about a pure Nash

845
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,599
equilibrium, that was a very natural

846
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,520
solution concept. But unfortunately, we

847
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,480
had simple games like the matching

848
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,640
pennies example that had no pure Nash

849
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,359
equilibrium.

850
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,920
Now a mixed Nash equilibrium is more

851
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,000
promising because we've augmented the

852
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,920
strategy space so that Alice and Bob

853
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,240
choose distributions.

854
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,440
What I claim the correlary of this

855
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,319
theorem is that every zero sum game has

856
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,920
a mixed Nash equilibrium. So that's the

857
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,680
first thing we're going to prove and

858
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,760
then we'll come back and we'll prove the

859
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,960
minimax theorem based on our

860
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,480
understanding of LP duality.

861
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,800
All right. So let me state that

862
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,800
correlary and then let's prove it.

863
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,440
I claim every two-player

864
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,160
zero sum game

865
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,160
has a mix Nash equilibrium.

866
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:21,359
So the main question is, you know, where

867
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,680
am I going to get my strategies that are

868
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:28,240
purportedly mix Nash equilibrium,

869
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,319
right?

870
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,599
This part's not so obvious, but it's

871
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:33,760
really going to come from the two

872
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,440
expressions right here.

873
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:38,319
So here's how the proof is going to

874
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,520
work.

875
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:45,920
We're going to let lambda star

876
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:49,520
uh equal the max min which of course is

877
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,839
equal to the min max.

878
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,960
Right? And now the main question is

879
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:57,359
where are my strategies going to be? So

880
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,200
what I'm going to do is I'm going to let

881
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:03,280
Xstar

882
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:06,560
and Ystar, these are my purported mixed

883
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,560
Nash equilibrium, they'll be the optimal

884
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,560
strategies

885
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:21,839
in two and one respectively.

886
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,640
So the way to think about it is in these

887
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:29,200
different scenarios, right? So xstar is

888
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,680
you know the answer when the row player

889
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,920
is forced to go first.

890
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:37,200
Y star is the answer when the column

891
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,280
player is forced to go first.

892
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,440
And what I'm going to prove is that

893
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,160
these pair of strategies really are a

894
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,160
mixed Nash equilibrium.

895
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,280
So now let's put it all together.

896
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,720
So we can take XAR transpose C Y

897
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,119
and I claim we have the following

898
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,119
inequality.

899
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,400
So what does this inequality mean in

900
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,800
words? Right? So we know that lambda

901
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,359
star is the payoff when these two

902
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,400
players play xstar and ystar

903
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,040
respectively. Right? And so what's going

904
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,440
on here is that when the row player

905
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,560
pre-commits to xstar,

906
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,160
I claim that no matter what the column

907
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:47,079
player does for his strategy that the

908
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,079
payoff is at least lambda star.

909
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,640
That's what it means for this

910
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:56,079
formulation in two to have the value

911
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:59,520
lambda star is that I can choose my

912
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,359
xstar strategy and no matter what

913
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,800
happens after I pre-commit to that

914
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:08,160
strategy I get the value at least lambda

915
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,839
star no matter what that strategy is. So

916
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,079
this is literally just translating the

917
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,599
statement of how we're playing the game

918
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:19,599
in scenario two into a system of linear

919
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,319
inequalities the same way that we've

920
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,960
been doing thus far. Right? I'm going to

921
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:27,599
call this set of inequalities a because

922
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,440
I'm going to have to put it together.

923
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,920
And similarly we can do the same thing

924
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,920
the other direction.

925
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:43,599
Xrpose C Ystar

926
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:46,960
is at most lambda star and this holds

927
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:50,319
for all X that belongs to this

928
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:53,680
distribution on M things, right? And

929
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:56,480
this holds because you know when uh the

930
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,640
column player has to go first. This is

931
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,119
what it means to have a good strategy in

932
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,000
scenario one is that the column player

933
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,400
chooses this distribution yst star. And

934
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,119
no matter what the row player does, we

935
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,040
still get the value at most lambda

936
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,720
squared. We're losing at lambda star.

937
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,599
We're losing at most lambda star

938
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,480
dollars. So I'll call this system of

939
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:22,119
linear inequalities B.

940
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,119
And you know together

941
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:31,280
what these two things imply

942
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:36,960
is that they imply that xar transpose c

943
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:38,720
y star is equal to lambda star.

944
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,040
Just by putting these two constraints

945
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,000
that we have over all y and over all x

946
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:48,240
together, we get exactly what we wanted

947
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
that the payoff really is lambda star.

948
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,440
And so what this means when we put it

949
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,440
all together is that

950
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:05,640
a + b plus c mean that

951
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,640
the expected

952
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:13,280
Win loss

953
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:17,960
is lambda star

954
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,960
and no worse.

955
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,680
So no one can actually do better. So

956
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,800
this really, you know, just the

957
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:29,119
statement of this minmax equals max min

958
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,960
is really just a translation of the

959
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,359
statement that uh no one has an

960
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,599
incentive to deviate. As long as we're

961
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,599
careful about how we get those minimax

962
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,359
strategies, right? And the way we get

963
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,599
the minimax strategy is we piece it

964
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,359
together. One of the strategies comes

965
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,119
from this scenario of how we play the

966
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,599
game where it's unfair to the column

967
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:50,000
player. and one comes from this scenario

968
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,480
where it's unfair to the row player

969
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,800
instead who has to go first. So are

970
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,560
there any questions? That's the first

971
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:01,440
main punchline is that all uh zero sum

972
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:03,920
games with two players are guaranteed to

973
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,400
have a mix Nash equilibrium and that

974
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,960
follows just from Bonoyman's minmax

975
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,440
theorem which we're now going to prove.

976
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,440
So any questions?

977
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,960
Good.

978
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,960
All right. So now let's prove the minmax

979
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,960
theorem.

980
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,880
The first thing I'm going to do before I

981
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,599
prove the minmax theorem is I'm going to

982
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,880
tell you a lema that makes precise

983
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:47,760
something that I asserted earlier.

984
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,839
that the notion of deviation

985
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,960
you can without loss of generality just

986
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:55,440
deviate to pure strategies. Let's make

987
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,680
this precise and then we'll prove it and

988
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,800
we'll see how it's really weak duality

989
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,800
types of arguments in action.

990
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,160
So here's my key helper lema we're going

991
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:11,760
to use to prove the minmax theorem. I

992
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:16,359
claim that the constraint

993
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,359
or rather the system of constraints

994
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:22,559
xrpose cxy

995
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:26,720
is at least lambda and this is true for

996
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:30,319
all y in delta n. Let me call this the

997
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:33,319
constraint system three I claim is

998
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,319
equivalent

999
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:44,559
to the constraint

1000
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:49,119
xrpose c ej is at least lambda and this

1001
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:50,559
is true for all j belonging to n and I'm

1002
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,480
going to call this constraint system

1003
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,559
four.

1004
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,760
So this just makes precise the thing

1005
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:59,680
which I asserted uh earlier.

1006
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,160
I'm just saying that when we have a

1007
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,319
system of constraints, this is an

1008
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,720
extraordinarily complicated system of

1009
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:08,880
constraints because there are infinitely

1010
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,200
many constraints.

1011
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,400
One for every choice of y that's a

1012
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,559
distribution on n things. And I want the

1013
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,160
constraint that no matter what you

1014
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:22,160
choose for y, my payoff when I play x is

1015
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,160
at least lambda. That's what this

1016
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,319
constraint is saying. No matter what

1017
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,960
randomized strategy you try, I get at

1018
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:31,040
least lambda. I claim that this system

1019
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:34,160
of constraints that's captured by this

1020
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:37,359
equation three is equivalent to this

1021
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:40,000
much simpler system of constraints that

1022
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:43,760
when I play X, I just have to consider

1023
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,760
strategies for U that are deterministic

1024
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:50,960
strategies. So here EJ is the vector

1025
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,599
that has one one and the J coordinate

1026
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,599
and the rest of it is zeros. So what

1027
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,839
this corresponds to is instead of Y

1028
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,960
being a general distribution, it's now a

1029
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,800
fixed choice of of playing strategy J

1030
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,359
and I just need to ensure that against

1031
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,760
every one of your individual strategies,

1032
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:09,920
I get at least lambda. So this is the

1033
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,040
crux of what I was saying earlier that

1034
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,839
uh I only need to consider deviations

1035
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,599
which are deterministic strategies. It's

1036
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:19,520
really the statement that these system

1037
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,599
of linear inequalities are actually

1038
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:24,079
equivalent to each other. You can derive

1039
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:26,640
one from the other.

1040
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:30,119
So let's prove this fact. Uh the proof

1041
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,119
is very simple.

1042
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,599
So one direction is obvious because you

1043
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,839
know whenever I satisfy the constraints

1044
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,319
in three I better satisfy the

1045
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:44,960
constraints in four because you know

1046
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:47,119
this is just a subset of them. It's a

1047
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,119
very particular set of distributions I

1048
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,119
look at but the more interesting

1049
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:54,079
direction is when I satisfy all the

1050
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:56,160
constraints in four how exactly can I

1051
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,839
prove that I satisfy the constraints in

1052
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,319
three.

1053
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:04,000
So here the key point is that you know

1054
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:06,960
if I satisfy all of the constraints

1055
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,119
in four and I want to prove I satisfy

1056
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,920
the constraints in three what I'm going

1057
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:14,319
to do is I can take an arbitrary

1058
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,040
uh you know constraint y that belongs to

1059
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:19,760
the set three and what I can do is I can

1060
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,920
take this vector and I can break it up

1061
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,040
into the sum of simpler vectors. So it's

1062
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:29,440
the same thing as the sum from j= 1 to n

1063
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:31,440
of yj ej. Remember ej is just this

1064
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,559
placeholder that has a one in the j

1065
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,559
coordinate and a zero everywhere else.

1066
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,839
So this is just a simple equality

1067
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:42,079
breaking up this vector y into each one

1068
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,680
of the pieces for each one of its

1069
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,680
coordinates.

1070
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,160
And now I'm in business because when I

1071
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:54,160
consider an arbitrary constraint of the

1072
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:59,079
form xrpose cy is at least lambda,

1073
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,079
I claim that I can derive it

1074
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:10,960
as follows.

1075
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:14,559
I can take the sum from J= 1 to N of Y J

1076
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:18,240
X transpose

1077
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:22,000
C EJ

1078
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,760
let me just put the inequality inside.

1079
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,760
So the way to think about it is that if

1080
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,720
I take this vector Y and apply this

1081
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,640
substitution and use linearity I can

1082
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,359
just pull out all the YJS and the

1083
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:36,960
summation. And now what's going on is

1084
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:40,319
that this inequality right here is just

1085
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,720
a weighted linear combination non-gative

1086
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:45,359
linear combination of the inequalities

1087
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,280
that arise in three. So each one of

1088
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,160
these inequalities shows up in three

1089
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,400
because it corresponds to an EJ. And

1090
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,319
this tells me that I can actually go

1091
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,599
from satisfying these equations in

1092
00:53:54,319 --> 00:54:00,800
three, add them up in order to derive

1093
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:04,559
any constraint I want that arises in the

1094
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:06,400
constraint system three. Right?

1095
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,040
So this should remind you of, you know,

1096
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,760
weak duality because what's going on

1097
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:13,359
when you write the duel to an LP is

1098
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,559
you're really asking when I have a

1099
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:18,800
maximization problem, how can I set up a

1100
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:21,760
companion LP? That's a minimization

1101
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:24,240
problem that deres an upper bound on the

1102
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,400
largest value of the max I can get. The

1103
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,240
way that you form the duel is really by

1104
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,480
taking the inequalities in your original

1105
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:33,040
system and adding them up with the

1106
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,119
appropriate variables. So your duel is

1107
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,599
just asking what's the choice of how to

1108
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:40,000
add up those inequalities to derive the

1109
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,599
best constraint. That's exactly how you

1110
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,440
prove weak duality and it's really the

1111
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,640
crux of what's going on from a game

1112
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:50,960
theoretic standpoint here too.

1113
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:52,960
So, are there any questions? Make sense?

1114
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,000
Once we have this lema, now let's prove

1115
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:58,000
the minimax theorem.

1116
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,760
And because we already have all of the

1117
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,960
tools of linear programming duality, uh

1118
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:07,000
we're just going to prove it by

1119
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,000
appealing to LP duality.

1120
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,400
So, let's prove the minimax theorem

1121
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:13,400
using this helper lema.

1122
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,920
So what we're going to do is we're going

1123
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:47,319
to write down an LP

1124
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,319
for playing

1125
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,559
in scenario one.

1126
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:56,160
So the proof strategy is very simple for

1127
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:57,839
this. What we're going to do is I told

1128
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,760
you that the minimax theorem is really

1129
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,119
about saying that two different

1130
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,520
scenarios for playing the game are

1131
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,440
equivalent. We're going to write down an

1132
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,839
LP that captures each of these

1133
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,960
scenarios. That captures scenario one

1134
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:12,640
and that captures scenario two.

1135
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,640
And what we're going to observe is that

1136
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,960
those two LPS are actually going to be

1137
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,480
dual to each other. So that's the way

1138
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,400
that the proof of the minimax theorem

1139
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:23,920
goes. So I'll suggestively write P for

1140
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:28,960
primal.

1141
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:32,200
So we want to maximize lambda

1142
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,200
such that

1143
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:38,119
one second.

1144
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,799
This would actually be scenario two. So

1145
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:47,040
let's do scenario two. Sorry for getting

1146
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:49,599
it backwards. All right. So for scenario

1147
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:54,319
two, we want to maximize lambda subject

1148
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:56,319
to the constraint that xrpose

1149
00:56:54,319 --> 00:57:00,079
c

1150
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:05,040
ej is at least lambda. This should be

1151
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:08,960
true for all j in my strategy set n. I

1152
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:14,079
want that the sum of the x i from i = 1

1153
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:18,559
to m is equal to 1 and all of the x i's

1154
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:20,319
are non- negative for all i.

1155
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:23,599
So really what's going on is I'm trying

1156
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:26,160
to maximize this value lambda. That's a

1157
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,680
lower bound on how well I do. But you

1158
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,720
know part of the action is really the

1159
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,559
choice of what the x is. So I want to

1160
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,440
find a strategy X which is a

1161
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:38,480
distribution on the strategies with the

1162
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,720
property that um no matter what the

1163
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,440
other player plays in response I've

1164
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:46,319
chosen X no matter what the other player

1165
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,640
plays in response for every strategy J I

1166
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:51,440
will guarantee that an average I win at

1167
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,920
least lambda and now I don't just want

1168
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:56,480
to find an arbitrary X that satisfies

1169
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:59,119
this condition but I want to make lambda

1170
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,079
as large as possible. So I want to

1171
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:04,319
maximize my safe value so that there

1172
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:06,240
exists a strategy X so that no matter

1173
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:09,119
what you do I get at least this value

1174
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:12,160
lambda in expectation. And this is the

1175
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:14,079
same thing as scenario two because you

1176
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,720
know once the row player has committed

1177
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:18,880
to playing the strategy X then what

1178
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,880
would the column player do? they would

1179
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,720
choose the J that minimizes this

1180
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:24,880
quantity so they lose the least amount

1181
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:27,359
of money which is the same thing as

1182
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,720
asking that it's for always uh at least

1183
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:34,440
lambda. So that's my primal and now I

1184
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,440
can do the same thing

1185
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:42,119
in scenario one.

1186
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,599
So I'll suggestively write D for duel

1187
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:50,640
here. And here what I would do is I

1188
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:54,640
would minimize overall lambda. I would

1189
00:58:50,640 --> 00:59:02,240
want the constraint that ei transpose c

1190
00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:04,240
y is at most lambda for all i in m. And

1191
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:07,440
of course I want the constraints that my

1192
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:12,000
vector y is a distribution. So the sum

1193
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:15,280
from j= 1 to n of y j equals 1. All the

1194
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:18,240
y's are non- negative

1195
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,760
on each of the coordinates. And so here

1196
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,319
it's the same type of thing but in

1197
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,960
reverse. My column player is going

1198
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:26,960
first. My column player is choosing a

1199
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,680
strategy so that no matter what the row

1200
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:32,640
player does, you can guarantee that an

1201
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:36,160
expectation I lose at most lambda

1202
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:39,040
dollars. And I want my lambda my upper

1203
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:41,280
bound on how much I lose expectation to

1204
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:43,119
be as small as possible. could even be

1205
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,119
negative if I win dollars in

1206
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:48,400
expectation.

1207
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:50,799
So these are the two uh you know LPS

1208
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:54,640
right and you know the proof of the

1209
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:57,440
minmax theorem now is very simple

1210
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:01,079
because what you can do

1211
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,079
is you can check

1212
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:13,160
that P and D

1213
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,160
are ds to each Okay.

1214
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,720
And moreover,

1215
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,960
both are feasible.

1216
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:31,119
Why? Because I can just choose any X

1217
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:34,000
that's a distribution, any Y that's a

1218
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:36,160
distribution. That'll be some value for,

1219
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,240
you know, finite value for lambda in

1220
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,640
both of these two scenarios. So

1221
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,960
feasibility is not a problem. And once

1222
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:47,880
you have that both are feasible, you

1223
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,880
know that strong duality holds.

1224
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,960
So we know that their optimal values

1225
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,359
are equal.

1226
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:14,200
So this gives us vonoyman's min max

1227
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:14,200
theorem. P is equal to you know max min

1228
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:21,400
which is equal to d which is the same

1229
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,400
thing as min max.

1230
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:30,000
So [clears throat] this is also not just

1231
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:31,920
the cool application of um of lp duality

1232
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,480
but it really gives you a better way to

1233
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:37,119
think about LP duality. So what is weak

1234
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:40,400
duality? Well, one way to think about

1235
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,880
what that concept means is, you know,

1236
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:46,000
when I'm in scenario P and I'm playing

1237
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:49,359
according to this uh scenario 2, one way

1238
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,559
I can prove for you that you can't get a

1239
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:55,760
very large value lambda is if I just

1240
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:58,559
have to exhibit a good strategy for the

1241
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:01,040
other player. Once I have a feasible

1242
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,799
solution to this linear program, that

1243
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:05,040
tells me how the column player has to

1244
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:07,599
play. And that tells me that my row

1245
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:10,000
player can't do all that well. So these

1246
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:11,839
two things act as certificates of each

1247
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,160
other. Whenever I have a feasible

1248
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:15,920
solution to one side, then it implies

1249
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:18,480
something about the other side not being

1250
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:21,040
too good, right? And that's really the

1251
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,200
crux of what weak duality is all about.

1252
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,920
And strong duality just tells us that

1253
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:28,400
actually the best certificate we can get

1254
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:32,240
you know for P from D is actually equal

1255
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:36,559
to the optimal value that we can obtain.

1256
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:38,799
All right. So any questions make sense?

1257
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:40,799
All right. So we covered a lot of ground

1258
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:42,240
already. So we talked about zero sum

1259
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:44,079
games. We talked about pure Nash

1260
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,799
equilibrium and how sometimes they don't

1261
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:49,920
exist. We extended our solution concept

1262
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:52,400
to mix Nash equilibrium. And once we had

1263
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,880
mixed Nash equilibrium then there were a

1264
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,920
lot of basic questions like um you know

1265
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,480
do they always exist? We proved that

1266
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,960
they do exist by courtesy of the vonoman

1267
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,920
minmax theorem that told us where xar

1268
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,559
and yar came from and then we proved the

1269
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,960
minax theorem just as a consequence of

1270
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,720
lp duality.

1271
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,319
So one of the amazing things I told you

1272
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:18,160
that this is you know one of my favorite

1273
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:21,280
theorems. Um so actually first let me

1274
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:23,839
tell you the uh let's go back to the

1275
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:27,200
example we had earlier where I had you

1276
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:30,160
guys play uh you know that game. So we

1277
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:34,119
can ask the same questions uh you know

1278
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:34,119
that I asked back then.

1279
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:45,359
So when I wrote down that C matrix let's

1280
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:49,039
just write it down one more time.

1281
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:50,559
So I had this payoff matrix C that was

1282
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:53,119
3x3

1283
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:56,000
2 -1

1284
01:03:53,119 --> 01:04:02,920
3 2 2

1285
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,920
- 3 -1 2 - 3.

1286
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:11,240
So we can ask the same types of

1287
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:11,240
questions. Who's in the better position?

1288
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,359
Maybe you still wouldn't know the

1289
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:21,280
answer, but you know, how could I find

1290
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:23,359
out who's in the better position? So,

1291
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:27,400
how would we answer this question now?

1292
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:27,400
Now that we have all this technology,

1293
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:35,720
what should I try and compute?

1294
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,359
>> Yeah,

1295
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,520
>> I guess the optimal solution

1296
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:46,240
Yeah, that's right. So, one thing I can

1297
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:49,720
do is I can compute the game value

1298
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,720
lambda star

1299
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,119
lambda star which is called the game

1300
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:01,599
value.

1301
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,920
Remember the game value captures if both

1302
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:07,039
players played optimally

1303
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,880
who would win how much in expectation.

1304
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,480
So one way I can answer this question of

1305
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,359
who's in the better position is I can

1306
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,599
compute the game value lambda star. Now

1307
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:19,680
in simple examples like the matching

1308
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:21,920
pennies computing the game value is easy

1309
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:23,839
because it's zero. We know what the best

1310
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,920
strategy is. Every player plays randomly

1311
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:28,319
and then everyone wins nothing in

1312
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,920
expectation. But now for more

1313
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:32,319
complicated games where it's not so

1314
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:34,400
obvious who you would want to be, I can

1315
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:37,039
just feed this to my linear programming

1316
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:41,599
solver and I can compute whatever the

1317
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:45,200
lambda star is. So in fact um the thing

1318
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:48,079
you can show is that lambda star is

1319
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:51,760
actually one3

1320
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:54,240
a third of a dollar.

1321
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:55,920
So what this means is that uh so who

1322
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,680
should I be the row or the column

1323
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,839
player?

1324
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,839
the row player, right? So, if we had

1325
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:03,359
played with real money, then you

1326
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:05,359
actually would have won money if you

1327
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:07,359
played according to the minimax optimal

1328
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:09,920
strategy. Maybe sometimes you get

1329
01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:11,839
unlucky and you lose some money. But

1330
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,640
it's not actually this game of, you

1331
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:16,079
know, um, whack-a-ole where one player

1332
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,720
plays a good strategy and the other

1333
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:21,680
player switches to try and get a better

1334
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:23,760
strategy and do better in response. In

1335
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:26,160
the beginning, uh, you know, you lost

1336
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,680
money and then you quickly came back.

1337
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:29,920
But we know what this game of

1338
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:32,720
whack-a-ole converges to, at least if

1339
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:35,119
both players play rationally because

1340
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:38,319
both players should really just play

1341
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:40,960
their mix Nash equilibrium. And you can

1342
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:46,440
check that uh, you know, the XAR that

1343
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:46,440
does this. Let me just write it down.

1344
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,960
So you can actually solve this just with

1345
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,760
a you know by hand or plugging it into

1346
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,920
an LP solver.

1347
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:04,960
And what you'll end up getting is that

1348
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:06,640
uh you know xar is equal to 5 9th 0 4

1349
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:11,359
9ths

1350
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:12,880
and y star is equal to 0

1351
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:16,160
2/3

1352
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:20,960
and 1/3 right

1353
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:25,200
and we can check that xar transpose c is

1354
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:27,920
equal to this vector 2/3

1355
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:29,920
1/3.

1356
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,640
So that's my proof that the game value

1357
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,720
is at least a third is when I play that

1358
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:37,440
randomized strategy when I am the row

1359
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:39,200
player. Well, this vector right here

1360
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,000
just describes whatever the column

1361
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:44,559
player responds to, you know, uh what

1362
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,119
would be my expected value? The column

1363
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,839
player should never play this strategy,

1364
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:52,400
right? And they'll only play among these

1365
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:54,799
two strategies. and I've guaranteed

1366
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:58,640
myself that I'll win at least a third of

1367
01:07:54,799 --> 01:08:01,839
a dollar, right? So, did our two uh

1368
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:03,760
volunteers play optimally?

1369
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:05,920
So, you can think about it. What this

1370
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:08,160
tells us is that in the optimal

1371
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,640
strategy, you should actually never

1372
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:13,920
play, if you're the row player, strategy

1373
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:15,359
two, but that happened. If you're the

1374
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:16,960
column player, you should never play

1375
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,480
strategy one. I don't mean to pick on

1376
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,199
you. It's a hard game. And that's why I

1377
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:22,960
picked it was because it's not obvious.

1378
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:24,799
And this is really what's powerful about

1379
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,319
this solution concept is we took

1380
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:28,719
something that we had no idea how to

1381
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:30,319
play and we just figured out how to play

1382
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:31,839
it. We figured out how to play it

1383
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,159
optimally.

1384
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:36,000
Now in fact um let me ask you an even

1385
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:38,560
tougher question because really my goal

1386
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,560
is not just to teach you about zero sum

1387
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:43,440
games but to give you to you as a

1388
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,839
vantage point for how to think about the

1389
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:48,480
key concepts from linear programming in

1390
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:51,679
a more intuitive way at least in a way I

1391
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:55,120
like to um so one thing you'll notice

1392
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:59,120
right I take xar and I take xar

1393
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:01,920
transpose time c right

1394
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:03,600
and um you know I get this vector 2/3

1395
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,159
1/3

1396
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,159
Now only these things are tight with the

1397
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:10,400
game value. These are the only things

1398
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:12,799
that match what I claim my lambda star

1399
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,880
is.

1400
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:17,839
What concept from linear programming

1401
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,839
theory tells me why I must have a zero

1402
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:22,719
here?

1403
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:25,279
This is a very tricky question.

1404
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:27,600
We already covered weak duality. weak

1405
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:29,520
duality in the context of game theory

1406
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:32,080
was how these two different scenarios

1407
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,520
for playing the game, one which seems to

1408
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:35,679
advantage the row player, one which

1409
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,279
seems to advantage the column player,

1410
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,359
figuring out how to play one of those

1411
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:42,719
scenarios bounds what's possible in the

1412
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:45,359
other scenario. That was weak duality. I

1413
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:49,120
claim that when I take xstar transpose

1414
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:53,359
time c and xar and yar are my purported

1415
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:55,520
optimal solutions and I look at where I

1416
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:57,679
have tight inequalities

1417
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:00,159
that these values for the payoffs are

1418
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:04,080
actually equal to lambda star the game

1419
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:07,600
value that anything that's not tight has

1420
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:10,480
to have a matching zero.

1421
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,880
What concept? I hope Peter covered this.

1422
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:16,239
Yeah. Is it basic?

1423
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:18,960
>> Uh, it's related very close. What about

1424
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:21,520
complimentary slackness?

1425
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:24,239
So, this is complimentary slackness

1426
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,560
because whenever I have an inequality

1427
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:28,400
that's not tight,

1428
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:30,159
right? Like this one right here. This is

1429
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:33,440
not a tight inequality. It's not equal

1430
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:36,320
to the lambda star. I better have the

1431
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:38,239
corresponding variable is equal to zero.

1432
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:41,520
The only way that I can have strong

1433
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:46,640
duality hold is as long as that's true.

1434
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:48,719
And if instead I took C * Y star

1435
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:51,719
and I wrote it out, I would get you know

1436
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:51,719
1/3.

1437
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:57,600
So I don't get any constraints but you

1438
01:10:54,159 --> 01:11:00,480
know if instead I had some value was not

1439
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:03,920
equal to 1/3 then the corresponding

1440
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:05,600
thing in X had better be equal to 02.

1441
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,760
See the way to think about complimentary

1442
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:10,800
slackness is that if this is my

1443
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:13,440
purported optimal solution, if Xstar and

1444
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:16,080
Ystar are my purported optimal pair,

1445
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:19,199
then as soon as Ystar has some positive

1446
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:22,320
mass on this outcome, then I actually am

1447
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:24,239
winning more in expectation than 1/3. So

1448
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:26,800
my game value cannot be the correct

1449
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:28,719
answer. So it's really also you can

1450
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,840
think about complimentary slackness as

1451
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:34,159
this constraint about the compatibility

1452
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:38,159
of their two strategies and the

1453
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:40,880
associated vectors of expected payoff.

1454
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:42,640
So let me briefly mention um you know

1455
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:46,080
this is way beyond the scope of this

1456
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:48,480
class but you know uh one of the reasons

1457
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:50,480
this is my favorite result at least in

1458
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:54,080
the things I teach in undergraduate

1459
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:57,679
classes is uh actually my PhD thesis

1460
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:59,760
started in some way from this. So I had

1461
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:02,000
um you know a result that I wanted to

1462
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:04,080
show in graph theory which I'm not going

1463
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,920
to explain what it is but it's a very

1464
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:08,320
complicated and kind of surprising

1465
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:11,760
result. So I remember I went into my

1466
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:14,239
advisor's office uh in Okami and then I

1467
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,159
told him I proved this amazing theorem

1468
01:12:14,239 --> 01:12:18,719
about you know all kinds of graphs about

1469
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:21,280
a structural theorem about them and he

1470
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:23,600
said uh there's no way you proved that.

1471
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,600
Um that doesn't even sound true to me.

1472
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,040
So he started writing some concrete

1473
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,840
examples. You know what would your

1474
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:31,679
sparsifier look like for this graph? I

1475
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,440
couldn't do it. He gave me another

1476
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,960
example. I couldn't do it. He gave me

1477
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,320
another example. I think he started to

1478
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,679
feel bad for me because, you know, he

1479
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,760
seemed to get the hint that maybe I

1480
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,280
hadn't actually proven it. And he said,

1481
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,280
you know, how could you prove this if

1482
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:45,760
you can't construct any of them, you

1483
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:47,440
know, on the graphs I give you. And the

1484
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:51,280
way that I proved it was I actually

1485
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:53,040
appealed to a gigantic zero sum game

1486
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,480
where I was playing one of the players,

1487
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:56,800
the row player, and he was playing the

1488
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,719
column player. So, I didn't have to

1489
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,360
prove that such things existed by

1490
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:03,840
actually constructing them myself. I

1491
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:06,960
just had to show that any strategy he

1492
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,880
had for disproving their existence

1493
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,800
didn't work.

1494
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,880
And that gives you a very indirect way

1495
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,560
to prove existence of pretty exotic

1496
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,040
objects, things which are hard to wrap

1497
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,960
your head around otherwise. So even

1498
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:21,360
though you might not see this until much

1499
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,280
later if you see it, these types of

1500
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:25,840
things are really under the hood of a

1501
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:28,000
huge amount of comnatorial optimization.

1502
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:30,560
It's not just about zero sum games I can

1503
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,040
write down because sometimes it's about

1504
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:35,280
trul gigantic zero- sum games that are

1505
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:38,000
just exponentially large or impossibly

1506
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:39,760
large to wrap your head around. And you

1507
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,360
know instead of you know this whole idea

1508
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,920
about playing the game in two different

1509
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:46,480
scenarios instead of me having to prove

1510
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,880
to him that they existed I just had to

1511
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:50,560
prove that he couldn't prove me wrong.

1512
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,480
This gives you a great way to prove all

1513
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,719
kinds of exotic things that otherwise

1514
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:56,719
sound counterintuitive and like they

1515
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:58,239
should be false. So what's really

1516
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,920
amazing is when you take a lot of

1517
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:02,480
results across theoretical computer

1518
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,920
science that sound false to you and you

1519
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,159
don't have the intuition that sounds

1520
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:07,600
like they shouldn't exist. It turns out

1521
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:09,600
that when you pull on the thread a lot

1522
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:12,920
of times this is what's under the hood.

1523
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,920
Many times.
