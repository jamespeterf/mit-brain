00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,520
In my sophomore year, I walked onto the

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,160
crew team and it completely changed my

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,880
life. Having that outlet

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,480
for stress helps me enjoy both parts of

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,519
my life, both the athletic and the

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,519
academic side a lot

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:23,119
more. We kind of all push each other to

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,760
become the fastest boats that we can be.

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,599
But at the same time, in order to become

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,119
the best versions of ourselves, we have

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,599
to be supportive of each other

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,599
throughout the

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,840
way. The entire crew just rowing as one

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,239
person. You're all moving at the exact

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,350
same time. The ores are clicking in

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,840
exactly the same

18
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,920
[Music]

19
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,520
rhythm. That is just such an incredibly

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,879
magical moment that I've never

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,199
experienced anywhere else. For more MIT
