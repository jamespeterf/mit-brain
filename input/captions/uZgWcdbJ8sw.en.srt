00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,359
Hi, nice to meet you guys. Uh, I'm Zach

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,880
Cavlac, uh, founder CEO of Aperture. I

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,200
actually spent 11 years at MIT and my

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,839
PhD research was actually with Professor

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,359
Dena Katabi who spoke about emerald

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,920
earlier. So, I built about 500 of those

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,480
radar sensors and my expertise is seeing

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,160
through things with radar. And so

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,800
Aperture rather than seeing through

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,800
walls for healthcare, Aperture is using

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,680
satellite radar to see through tree

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,120
canopy and top soil for agriculture,

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,120
climate, and defense applications.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,000
And so one of the most important things

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,559
that being able to see through trees and

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,200
top soil allows is for the measurement

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,520
of soil moisture. If you think of water

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,160
as the fundamental variable for all life

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,680
on earth, um feeding the global

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,239
population is 4.5 billion acres of land.

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,280
Uh about a billion of that is irrigated

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,439
today uh across the world. But one of

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,760
the things that farmers don't know when

24
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,760
they walk out to a field is that they

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,600
don't know what's beneath the surface.

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,920
They see the weather from the last few

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,760
days. They look at the crop canopy and

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,360
how it's growing, but they have no idea

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,840
what's going on beneath the surface

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,920
today. And so most farmers will make

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,240
decisions about irrigation and soil

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,479
moisture based on what their what their

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,240
neighbor does or driving a truck their

34
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,880
truck down the dirt road and seeing how

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,479
much it picks up behind them. And the

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,880
same thing goes for fertilizer

37
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,680
application where when you apply

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,000
nitrogen fertilizer or pesticides, if

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,640
it's too dry, it might not get picked up

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,040
by the plants. If it's too wet, it runs

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,680
off into the community's water supply

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,159
leading to downstream uh Parkinson

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,640
disease and other types of uh health

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,680
conditions.

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,439
And so soil moisture is this fundamental

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,000
variable, but because it's below the

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,479
surface, nobody can see it. And so most

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,640
farmers don't do anything about it. And

49
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,479
those that do might plant a single

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,039
sensor at the edge of their field or the

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,080
side of their field. Um, but that only

52
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,239
tells them about that section. Uh, it's

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,160
hard. It's they're battery powered.

54
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,400
They're often collected to a cellular

55
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,360
back haul. They can be driven over with

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,680
tractors. Farmers hate them. There are

57
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,920
some satellites that take cameras and

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,319
pictures, but once the cra the canopy

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,319
grows and closes, you no longer see the

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,800
ground and the soil anymore, and so

61
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,519
you're left with uh just the changes in

62
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,720
the color of the leaves. Occasionally

63
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,200
there are one to two uh NASA European

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,160
Space Agency satellites that can

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,280
penetrate top soil, but they're frequent

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,920
and far few and far between. And so what

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,239
we're developing at Aperture are a

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,560
constellation of lowfrequency radar

69
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,519
satellites that can penetrate through

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,760
tree canopy and top soil to measure soil

71
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,560
moisture at high resolution directly on

72
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,640
the field. We pair that with uh machine

73
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,080
learning algorithms that let us fill in

74
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,560
the gaps today between satellite imagery

75
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,360
uh and extract additional insights and

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,519
intelligence off of this data.

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,280
And so the way we do it today, we

78
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,480
already are bringing a product to

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,239
farmers. Um we leverage those infrequent

80
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,640
satellite measurements and we pair it

81
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,440
with precision weather data uh

82
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,080
topological modeling and fuse it through

83
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,720
machine learning AI and hydraological

84
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,200
models to produce uh customer insights

85
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,360
and intelligence on a daily basis so

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,280
that when it rains, if there's a heat

87
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,239
wave coming, they know to irrigate

88
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,280
regardless of uh just the weather and

89
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,760
guessing on their own. And so we deliver

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,480
this through a cloud-based platform. uh

91
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,400
we offer it either as a a farmer-f

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,200
facing product or it can be a white

93
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,000
labeled model that ties into other types

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,080
of a tech or climate sustainability

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,799
based businesses that benefit from this

96
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,200
data set. Uh all of this is cloud as

97
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,280
cloud-based and highly scalable across

98
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,360
the continental US. And so our impact is

99
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,480
initially within agriculture, but we

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,320
have about uh $4 million in contracts

101
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,120
with the Space Force, Air Force, and

102
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,600
Navy. It turns out that the Air Force

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,199
also cares a lot about soil moisture

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,160
because when they want to model the

105
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,199
weather for their operations in Europe,

106
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,120
uh in Asia, in South America, they're

107
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,280
not getting weather station data to make

108
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,840
those decisions. And so soil moisture

109
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,240
acts as that boundary variable between

110
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,400
land and atmospheric interaction that

111
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,320
lets them make operational decisions. Um

112
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,560
with that because of our satellite and

113
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,720
our analytics we're interested in all

114
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,400
types of partnerships and collaborations

115
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,400
from aerospace uh defense intelligence

116
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,040
but also agriculture and climate

117
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,199
sustainability. So we have a table next

118
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,720
door. Feel free to come by and and share

119
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,759
a bit more about your company and

120
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,759
application. Thank you.
