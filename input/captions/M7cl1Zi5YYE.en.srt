1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,879
okay good

2
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:16,879
afternoon okay

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:25,279
so the last time we defined

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,039
the diffusive and convective

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,640
flaxes

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:34,160
I I want to review this um

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,120
definition with some uh

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,559
Graphics uh the idea is that

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,280
uh we have a a

10
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,440
Continuum with all the assumptions that

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,199
go under this this

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,440
description and uh suppose that anywhere

13
00:00:51,199 --> 00:01:00,559
somewhere inside your Continuum you will

14
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,559
set up a small um surface area

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,240
with a an

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,320
oriented normal

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:15,840
n and then you look at uh what

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,840
properties and here we are talking about

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,400
uh the extensive properties those that

20
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,759
we said that can be described as

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,040
integrals over

22
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:31,040
volume uh

23
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:35,840
of densities of those of that properties

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:39,079
like energy entropy Mass

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:46,079
momentum so this is pro how much of that

26
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:46,079
property crosses uh the um that uh

27
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:55,719
area and which and with which um U speed

28
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:58,799
so how much it transfers it goes across

29
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,360
divided by the area of this surface that

30
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,640
we call uh

31
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,640
D

32
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,959
Omega and divided by

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,319
the time interval during which we

34
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,120
measure the amount that

35
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,519
crosses

36
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,519
that uh defines the

37
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:27,519
flux

38
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:30,760
uh so let's consider first the flux the

39
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:33,519
measurement in terms of the reference

40
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,480
frame of the

41
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:41,480
laboratory and that we call it J

42
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:45,159
Zer I also call it lren but maybe the

43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,159
term lent is not really appropriate but

44
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:50,560
in any case it's it's the flux with

45
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:54,519
respect to the laboratory reference

46
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,720
frame and once I have done that and I

47
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:01,239
know the um density which means the

48
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:05,440
property per unit uh uh volume that

49
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:09,519
prevails in that

50
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,959
position that defines also a

51
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,080
velocity which is the velocity of

52
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:18,239
transport of that

53
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:22,000
property which is this Vector

54
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:26,239
here okay so multiply so the long Vector

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,239
is is the flux the short Vector is the

56
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,040
velocity one of the properties is

57
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,760
Mass so if I do that same measurement

58
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,920
for mass I get the flux of

59
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,920
mass which is what we call

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,040
Momentum momentum density and

61
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,879
uh and the velocity associated with with

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:55,879
that flux we call it bicentric velocity

63
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,879
of the flow it's the velocity of fluid

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,480
mechanics

65
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,640
okay then we Define also a a uh for

66
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,200
property a we go back to property a and

67
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:13,159
we Define a relative velocity so the

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:18,000
difference between VA

69
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:21,240
and the velocity with which uh fluid

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,040
Parcels uh cross that

71
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:28,360
surface which is the ventric

72
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,199
velocity so the difference you compute

73
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,840
since these are vectors the this way

74
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,280
know like the typical Vector

75
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,160
construction so this blue Vector is the

76
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,240
difference between the two it's the

77
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,039
relative velocity it's the velocity of

78
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,280
transport of property a relative to the

79
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:46,320
bicentric

80
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,520
velocity and then you

81
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,360
multiply by the same factor that goes

82
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,320
between the short and the long Vector

83
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:59,039
here so the density of property a and

84
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,639
that gives you the diffusive flux of

85
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,639
property a

86
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,759
and the

87
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:10,360
difference between j z and the diffusive

88
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,520
flat is flux is the convective flux

89
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,840
which is this Vector red Vector which of

90
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,240
course by construction is directed in

91
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:23,680
the same direction as

92
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:26,240
the velocity bicentric

93
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,520
velocity and so you can take it also as

94
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,840
the bicentric velocity times the density

95
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,840
of property a so it's this Vector

96
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,039
here

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,199
okay then we have defined uh this

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,440
extension or generalization of the idea

99
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,360
of a heat

100
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,600
interaction to when of the same in the

101
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,960
same way as we did heat we

102
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:07,160
approach the interactions between

103
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:11,680
systems that uh uh are

104
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,599
almost in mutual equilibrium so exactly

105
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,520
or almost exactly the same temperature

106
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,440
and the same chemical

107
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,319
potentials and they

108
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,919
exchange not only energy but also

109
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,599
amounts of

110
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:29,599
constituents and the relation Q overt

111
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:33,360
for heat generalizes to this relation

112
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:38,319
between the flux of entropy the flux of

113
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,479
energy the flux of uh

114
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,080
constituents

115
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,599
here we

116
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,599
are introducing also this variables that

117
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:50,919
are sort of

118
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,160
shorthand instead of carrying all the

119
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:54,160
times one over the temperature we just

120
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,680
call it

121
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,080
tow which I know it's a bit

122
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,840
unfortunate nomenclator because then we

123
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,319
will use to double underline also for

124
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,240
the stress tensor

125
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,720
but that double underline will will keep

126
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:14,960
the difference and also

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:17,759
Lambda Lambda J denotes uh minus the the

128
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,960
potential over T so we use Lambda or

129
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,560
Lambda tot for the chemical potential or

130
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,560
the total

131
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:28,120
potential and so the relation

132
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,479
between

133
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,199
energy will

134
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:39,199
energy entropy and uh

135
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:40,879
n is is can be written this way so once

136
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,720
we have this relation between vectors

137
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,039
we're going to use it for example in the

138
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,560
balance equations where there is a

139
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:52,479
Divergence of of the

140
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,759
flaxes um well we can take the the

141
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:59,840
Divergence of these and that's how it

142
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,199
goes it's typically a product so the

143
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,599
Divergence of a product of a scalar

144
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:08,240
times a vector is given by these two

145
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,840
terms the gradient of the scalar dotted

146
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,159
into the vector times the scalar times

147
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,159
the Divergence of the

148
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:25,039
vector now remember that

149
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:30,639
energy in our model has a several

150
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:33,560
components one is uh the internal energy

151
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,800
proper of the stable equilibrium state

152
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:40,159
that is underlying that is there that

153
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,240
would be the only thing if we view our

154
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,959
fluid element from a reference frame

155
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,040
that moves with uh the bicentric

156
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,160
velocity and therefore with respect to

157
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,120
that reference frame there is no uh

158
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,080
kinetic energy and also an accelerated

159
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,800
frame where you don't also see the

160
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,839
potential gravitational energy and then

161
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,760
here you have the additional

162
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:07,120
contribution for the

163
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,120
electrostatic um

164
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,760
energy if you

165
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,480
multiply this by row and I I put all the

166
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,160
stars just to be pedantic but at least

167
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,959
we know that we're talking what we're

168
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,600
talking about

169
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:29,440
uh um we get this um expression

170
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,680
here the total po potential therefore is

171
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,839
Define this way it's the derivative of e

172
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,680
with respect to n uh is given by these

173
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,600
contributions the chemical potential

174
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,160
plus uh this potential for

175
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,200
kinetic

176
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,200
um gravitational and

177
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,040
electrostatic

178
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,880
potentials

179
00:09:50,040 --> 00:10:00,399
okay so this is where we were I guess

180
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:03,160
and of course we the next step is to uh

181
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,800
substitute uh these assumptions about

182
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:10,560
the interactions between fluid

183
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:13,399
elements into the uh energy uh entropy

184
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,920
constituent balance and here I've also

185
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:18,920
done although I'm not going to talk too

186
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,480
much about it but I also written the

187
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,880
momentum balance that this is the fluid

188
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,920
mechanics uh

189
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,320
part for reference and uh as you

190
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,480
remember I have written the balance

191
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,959
balance equation in the two equivalent

192
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,240
forms that we have

193
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:41,200
derived one in terms of the lent

194
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,519
flues with the partial derivative of Ro

195
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,800
with respect to time the other with

196
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,040
respect to the diffusive flaxes with the

197
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,760
material

198
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:55,680
derivative uh of of the mass specific

199
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,200
properties we

200
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,200
proved the last time that these are

201
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,200
equivalent

202
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,680
from these equations

203
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:13,880
here and

204
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:17,079
possibly um well no from these equations

205
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:20,680
here you can obtain also these other

206
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:22,600
equations below that I'm skipping uh the

207
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,200
details but it's

208
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:29,920
simply uh for example uh the equation

209
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,720
for the conservation of mass which

210
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,920
derives from this one of the amounts

211
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:40,120
multiplied by the molecular masses this

212
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:44,399
is the so-call continuity equation of

213
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,399
mechanics which you can also write this

214
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,959
way and so this is the the Divergence of

215
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:56,040
V

216
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:57,839
represents uh the rate of change of the

217
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,959
volume of your fluid element as you

218
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,560
follow it during the motion during the

219
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:06,399
flow along its

220
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:11,600
path and typically uh

221
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:15,360
unless the flow is very Speedy so unless

222
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:19,199
the the mark number is is is

223
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:23,600
high uh you can assume incompressible

224
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:27,240
flow and so this Divergence is equal to

225
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,279
zero but for example from the momentum

226
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:35,160
balance equation if you dot it

227
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:37,360
into VM the velocity you can obtain a

228
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,600
balance for the kinetic

229
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,120
energy and then you can also get a

230
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,320
balance for the gravitational potential

231
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,639
energy and and a balance for the

232
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:52,399
electrostatic potential energy so

233
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,519
that you can uh

234
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,199
subtract from the overall energy of your

235
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,399
fluid

236
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:04,440
uh uh uh

237
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:08,000
the um the internal

238
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:11,040
energy and so that difference is made up

239
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,199
of just kinetic potential gravitational

240
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:18,800
and electrostatic so the sum of these

241
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:18,800
three gives you

242
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,279
this and it's the rate of change of the

243
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:31,800
mechanical

244
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,800
energy uh content of uh of your uh

245
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,360
fluid

246
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,440
okay and now we can put them all

247
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:52,800
together so we have

248
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:56,040
assumed the local simple system

249
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,880
equilibrium so that we can

250
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,240
write uh the energy this way that we

251
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,959
just just

252
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,880
described uh the simple system Model

253
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:09,360
includes the oiler relations so that

254
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,959
together it allows you to write the Gibs

255
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,120
relation in this

256
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:17,639
way remember T is 1 / T and Lambda is

257
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,639
minus mu over

258
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:26,079
T which as you uh

259
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,600
recall gets rid of the

260
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,040
pressure so that the if you need the

261
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,360
pressure need to go to the Gibs do

262
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:39,959
relation to get you the pressure from

263
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,959
the uh concentrations and temperature

264
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,519
gradients uh so we are going to assume

265
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,839
this relation between the properties of

266
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,959
the particles and notice this is the

267
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:56,639
internal energy just this part of the

268
00:14:51,959 --> 00:15:00,360
energy so we assume this relation holds

269
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,160
as You Follow the the fluid particle

270
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:07,079
along its

271
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:11,079
path so that assume that it is

272
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:11,079
valid uh for the material

273
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,279
derivatives that

274
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:22,040
means that uh the left hand side of the

275
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,880
balance equations uh that we have in the

276
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:29,199
previous slide where we have these uh

277
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,519
material derivatives they are related we

278
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,639
can essentially uh substitute the

279
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,920
balance equations into this one and we

280
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,560
get an

281
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,639
extra

282
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,880
relation

283
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:45,560
plus we are going to

284
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,319
assume the mode of interaction that we

285
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,319
call heat and

286
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,880
diffusion to

287
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:59,519
be uh

288
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,360
valid and holding between uh

289
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,560
fluid

290
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,839
elements as they move

291
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,560
along so it's the

292
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:13,000
diffusive fluxes that are related in

293
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,880
that way that we have

294
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:21,240
discussed with the exclusion

295
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:24,319
though of the flux of energy which is uh

296
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,160
related which is which is

297
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,120
work because when you have the fluid

298
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:33,920
element that deforms

299
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:37,720
especially uh it changes in in

300
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:41,639
volume uh that change in volume against

301
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:44,680
uh the normal components of the

302
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:47,000
stress uh imply work that is a kind of

303
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,199
interaction between adjacent fluid

304
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,319
elements that is not of the Heat and

305
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:57,920
diffusion kind so we

306
00:16:52,319 --> 00:17:01,000
excluded that's why I call this uh NW

307
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,880
non work so the nonwork component of the

308
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,919
heat transfer between uh the fluid

309
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:14,039
elements as they move along the path

310
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:17,199
line uh is related to entropy flux and

311
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:19,959
constituent flux as in the heat

312
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,600
diffusion mode of

313
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:26,400
interaction but energy has an additional

314
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:29,200
contribution which is the work

315
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,360
component given by the stress tensor

316
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,360
into the

317
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:43,200
velocity okay this one as we said we

318
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,320
take uh since in the balance equations

319
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,880
there appear divergencies all this stuff

320
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,559
all these

321
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:56,880
fluxes um we can combine those with the

322
00:17:52,559 --> 00:18:00,039
Divergence of this uh relation which is

323
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:05,440
here and a few things will come cancel

324
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:08,919
out and here are the terms that

325
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,440
survive and we write what

326
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:14,240
survives as an expression we took on the

327
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,039
left hand side only the rate of entropy

328
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,679
production the density of entropy

329
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:20,440
production so the rate of entropy

330
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,880
production per unit volume

331
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:27,600
Sigma and we have on the right hand side

332
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,600
all the terms that contribute to that

333
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
entropy

334
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:39,039
production this is the most General uh

335
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:44,320
form it uh includes all sorts of terms

336
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,320
one is an old friend of from chemical um

337
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,159
kinetics this term here will give rise

338
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,400
as you will see to the dissipation

339
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:55,679
function of fluid mechanics we see it in

340
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,039
a

341
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:05,039
moment the first term

342
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:09,520
is the one that U uh gives

343
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:14,200
the the Fier uh expression when you have

344
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:16,840
only uh heat and not also diffusion and

345
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,039
these are terms that we have to see what

346
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:24,640
they do because they do important uh

347
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,640
effects for many Publications

348
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,039
now the other time we

349
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,360
also

350
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:57,640
uh have seen how to uh

351
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:01,080
recognize uh in the

352
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:04,039
um heat I'm sorry energy uh in the

353
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,320
energy flux a portion of the energy flux

354
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:10,960
that we can still recognize as and call

355
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:14,200
heat or we call it the measurable heat

356
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,720
more properly but essentially it's the

357
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,600
part that we

358
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,720
can identify with the heat of heat

359
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,039
transfer so again with this Q double

360
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,039
prime

361
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:30,080
notation so if we take the nonwork part

362
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:31,679
of the energy flux it's given by the

363
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,520
heat

364
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:39,679
plus a portion which is related to the

365
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:43,440
flux so it's this is the energy which is

366
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,440
carried by uh the particles

367
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,440
uh

368
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:53,880
in just because they are

369
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,600
diffusing this is not convective because

370
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,080
this is a

371
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,960
diffusive part so this is part particles

372
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,799
that are moving different at a different

373
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,679
velocity than the bicentric velocity so

374
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,400
they diffuse away or into our fluid

375
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,440
element and as they do so they carry

376
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:18,000
with them their backpack of internal

377
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:21,559
energy and plus they also have to

378
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,559
um advance and face the the pressure

379
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:26,480
that is present and therefore there is

380
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,480
also this

381
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,520
uh there is this pure work which is p

382
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,039
times the the uh partial volume which is

383
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,080
hidden here because you remember the

384
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,679
enthalpy is U plus PV so this is a

385
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:46,640
partial enthalpy so it's partial energy

386
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:50,400
plus uh P times partial volume and uh

387
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,799
and that P times partial volume is the

388
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,799
pulsion work equivalent to what you

389
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:59,559
would have in a bulk flow

390
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,559
situation but here we are in diffusion

391
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:10,360
okay so we can

392
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:13,159
substitute this terms here into our

393
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,559
expression and this is a very typical

394
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:20,240
procedure that uh we

395
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:20,240
like uh somehow to

396
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:27,039
express uh to rewrite every time you

397
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,960
formulate a a problem in non equilibrium

398
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,200
thermodynamics you typically typically

399
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,720
start and it's the safer way to do it uh

400
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:39,279
start from the entropic point of view so

401
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,840
you write it in this way you identify

402
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,799
these gradients as

403
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,760
the degrees of non-e equilibrium related

404
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,760
to the various transport of the various

405
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,640
properties but then you like to

406
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,840
translate this into a more common and

407
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,760
familiar language and we since we

408
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,559
consider more familiar talking about

409
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,760
heat because it's related to q and Q

410
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:16,919
over t uh we often go back to these and

411
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:18,440
then also the fluxes of particles um and

412
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:24,159
and the chemical

413
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:28,279
potentials uh so we substitute this to

414
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:31,640
there we also use a relation that uh I

415
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:35,480
think we we've we' we've

416
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,000
discussed that you can write uh when you

417
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,520
write the differential of the chemical

418
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,360
potential you can separate the part that

419
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,320
depends on temperature and the parts

420
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,080
that uh changes that constant uh

421
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,200
temperature so it depends on pressure

422
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,279
and concentrations and so we we keep

423
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,240
that uh

424
00:23:53,279 --> 00:24:00,000
part written this way and so the bottom

425
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,720
line is that we can write

426
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,159
uh the entropy production density Sigma

427
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:11,440
in this way so here we have more

428
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:13,840
explicitly the Fier kind

429
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,760
of entropy

430
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,960
production here you have a similar term

431
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:24,720
related to diffusion here we still have

432
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:29,200
the usual uh term related to chemical

433
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,799
kinetics and uh what is left here is the

434
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,399
dissipation function one over the

435
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,440
temperature times the dissipation

436
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:38,039
function and here are the details of the

437
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,279
dissipation functions if you like if you

438
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:41,799
are a fluid

439
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:45,840
mechanist uh it has two contributions

440
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:49,399
it's not just the devor deviator part of

441
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,520
the stress tensor and the theoric

442
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:54,799
component of the

443
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:58,080
strain temperature I'm sorry

444
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:01,240
tensor but it has also this term which

445
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,760
is related to the Divergence of

446
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:08,360
B and it's true that for most flu flows

447
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:12,080
like low ma number flows this is zero so

448
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:16,240
this is really not important

449
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,720
but uh in principle this is one of the

450
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,799
dissipative terms and in fact notice

451
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,640
also that in our doing the the procedure

452
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:31,559
here there was a

453
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:34,480
pressure uh which is which came in uh

454
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:37,720
here and there is a PM which is a

455
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,120
mechanical pressure that is the the the

456
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,480
trace over oneir of the trace of the

457
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,480
stress

458
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,559
tensor uh they're not

459
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,559
necessarily uh the

460
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,000
same and so they give rise their

461
00:25:53,559 --> 00:26:01,559
difference gives rise to this

462
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,559
uh uh entropy production

463
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:10,760
term you can still view each of these uh

464
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:14,080
terms as a

465
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,720
product of a rate and an affinity or a

466
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,799
degree of this equilibrium so the

467
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,279
gradient in

468
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:23,279
temperature more properly minus one / T

469
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,399
squ times the gradient in temperature

470
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:28,880
can be interpreted as the degree of this

471
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:31,279
equilibrium associated with heat

472
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,399
uh

473
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,480
transport uh similarly minus one /t

474
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:39,200
times the gradient of the chemical

475
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,080
potential done at constant

476
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,039
t uh

477
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:48,279
is the degree of dise equilibrium with

478
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:48,279
respect to uh diffusion of

479
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:55,840
particles the affinities in chemical in

480
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:58,360
chemistry one / R they are already being

481
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,799
recognized as the degrees of the execu

482
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,159
equilibrium and here for for for the

483
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,320
fluid part we have a degree of thise

484
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:06,240
equilibrium which is related to the rate

485
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,120
of

486
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,919
strain just the symmetric part of the

487
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:15,799
rate of strain of the local stress

488
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,520
tensor I'm sorry velocity of the local

489
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:23,000
velocity field it's the gradient of the

490
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:27,000
Velocity field and uh whereas the

491
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,679
conjugated flux is the flux of momentum

492
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,880
which is related to

493
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,559
uh the stress tensor but then there is

494
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,799
also this one so

495
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,880
the Divergence of velocity which as we

496
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:42,360
said it's is the rate of change of

497
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,519
volume as you FL as You Follow the flu

498
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,840
the fluid

499
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:52,440
element that is also an

500
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:55,679
affinity for a for a

501
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:59,000
dissipation for which the flux is given

502
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:01,559
by these uh difference between the

503
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,159
thermodynamic pressure and the uh

504
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,159
mechanical

505
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:20,399
pressure if we also have um

506
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:24,159
charged particles so if some of the

507
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,440
constituents of our fluid that are uh

508
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,559
charged

509
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,960
particles and we still we talk

510
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,760
electrostatics not the electrodynamics

511
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,760
is is even more complicated because of

512
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,679
course then you get the Maxell equations

513
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:43,799
the magnetic field the vector potential

514
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:47,240
and so on too complicated to to to cover

515
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:48,240
uh and but in any case so here we have

516
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,240
just

517
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,640
electrostatics and uh so Fe is the

518
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,640
electrostatic

519
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,640
field

520
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,440
JQ okay JQ

521
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,360
is the

522
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:07,279
diffusive

523
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,279
component of the electric current

524
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,519
density because if this fluid element

525
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:16,919
contains

526
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,440
charges and these fluid element moves

527
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,399
with the bicentric

528
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:24,600
velocity okay there is a convective part

529
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:27,039
of the charge which produces an electric

530
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:31,080
current okay we're not talking about

531
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:34,760
this part we talking about the part of

532
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:38,840
uh charge exchange between adjacent

533
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:42,840
fluid elements due to the fact that they

534
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:46,760
have uh the diffusion the diffusion with

535
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:49,919
respect to the bicentric velocity so

536
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:52,679
this is diffusion flux of

537
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,000
charge and in fact so the total current

538
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:56,679
density would May denote it with I

539
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,880
double

540
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:01,679
Prime and it is the uh the flux of

541
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,360
charge with respect to the laboratory

542
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,720
frame so it's the flux with a zero on

543
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:12,200
top and it's made up of the diffusive

544
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,200
plus the convective

545
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:21,200
term and r q is the density of

546
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,200
charges the local density of

547
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,600
charges

548
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,840
so

549
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:33,640
uh the work part of the diffusive energy

550
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,519
flux is related to

551
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,720
heat to the diffusion of particles and

552
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:42,720
to the diffusion of of part of of of

553
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:48,360
charge okay so we have this extra term

554
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:51,120
which uh we can um sort of single out in

555
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,600
here when you do the same procedure as

556
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,440
before to write this expression in terms

557
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:59,519
of the familiar

558
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,000
variables so here

559
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:07,880
the entropy

560
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,679
production is related also to U minus

561
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,039
one / T times the gradient in the

562
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,679
electrostatic field is the degree of

563
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:19,360
dise equilibrium with respect

564
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:20,840
to to moving charges and the associated

565
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,720
or the conjugated

566
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:28,880
flux is this difference here which is

567
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,880
just the diffusive flux of charge

568
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:40,440
that's again the same

569
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:46,480
equation now the next step to introduce

570
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,480
the next notion is to group these

571
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:54,200
terms uh in order of increasing

572
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:58,880
tensorial character so some of these are

573
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,080
Scholars like chemistry

574
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,880
and

575
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,840
also uh inside the dissipation function

576
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,399
there is a scolar term which is the one

577
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,440
that we described before and then there

578
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:10,600
is a tensorial term which is the one

579
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,559
related

580
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:19,679
to uh the the contraction between the uh

581
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:22,679
deviatoric parts of stress and strain

582
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,279
tensors and the rest are

583
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:29,840
vectorial um terms heat

584
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:29,840
flux uh

585
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,120
current flux of particles these are

586
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,080
vectors why is that

587
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:50,519
important all right now so I I started

588
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,000
with um some coloring here just to

589
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:53,799
single out

590
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,720
the

591
00:32:53,799 --> 00:33:01,039
uh the degrees of the dise equilibrium

592
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:04,480
are the red stuff and the flues are the

593
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,080
blue and so you see H1 is written is a

594
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,480
is a product of a degree of this

595
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,480
equilibrium time times a

596
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:15,320
flux and if we recall what we said about

597
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:19,799
exergy you can also read this uh

598
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:22,720
expression as a a representation of how

599
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:29,559
locally your uh

600
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:32,200
fluid or Continuum is dissipating exergy

601
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:34,240
multiply that by the temperature of the

602
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,279
environment with respect to which you

603
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,639
want to or the reservoir which respect

604
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:44,200
to which you want to measure

605
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:47,399
exergy and so these terms tell you that

606
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:51,360
um you have dissipation whenever you

607
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:52,480
drive like I read here you drive a

608
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,360
chemical

609
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,799
reaction uh down the direction of a

610
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,960
decreasing affinity and that gives you

611
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,880
entropy production you drive a heat flux

612
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,760
down great temperature

613
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,760
gradient also you you D you drive a

614
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:12,200
diffusion flux down a chemical potential

615
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,440
gradient or an electric current down a

616
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:19,280
voltage drop or a momentum flux down a

617
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,520
velocity uh gradient which is the rate

618
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,520
of

619
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,520
strength

620
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:32,879
okay uh you may find if you uh look into

621
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,879
papers that deal with nilium

622
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:41,960
thermodynamics that expression up there

623
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,639
this one with all these terms written in

624
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:50,000
a compact form in this way as a sum of

625
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:52,639
products of fluxes and

626
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,879
uh instead of degrees of dise

627
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,960
equilibrium they're called

628
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:01,720
forces fluxes and forces so this is a

629
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:06,079
force flux representation of the same or

630
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:08,800
or short hand notation and um this

631
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,040
symbol here is that is is whatever is

632
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:16,119
appropriate to use when you have to

633
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:18,560
multiply a scalar flux times a scalar um

634
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:19,720
degree of dise equilibrium it's just a

635
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,599
simple

636
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,560
multiplication like

637
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:29,079
here uh when you have to

638
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,839
multiply a vector another Vector it is

639
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:34,079
the dot it's the vector product I'm

640
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,480
soorry not sorry the dot the dot product

641
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,599
because the vector product is something

642
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:44,480
else and U if you have uh to multiply

643
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:46,920
the tensor two tensors and get a scal

644
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,720
it's the contraction so if you take the

645
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,200
two matrices of the two tensors you

646
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,319
multiply them and then you take the

647
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:55,599
trace and that's the equivalent of of

648
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:58,240
this double dot

649
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,960
operation okay so we will we'll proceed

650
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,640
uh now for a

651
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,520
while uh I mean for today uh for the

652
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:10,960
rest of today I guess uh with this um

653
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:14,560
more abstract and short end

654
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,359
notation because we want to

655
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,599
discuss

656
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:24,319
some geometry of these uh uh of the

657
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:27,160
relations that um we we can write in

658
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:31,200
order to model how a flux is related to

659
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,200
a the force or vice

660
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:41,240
versa uh yeah um actually maybe should

661
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,079
go back a

662
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:47,240
moment

663
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,599
I I miss there was one slide that I

664
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:52,560
don't know where it got where it went

665
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:55,400
but in any case uh What uh maybe it will

666
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,119
come up later but uh uh what I need to

667
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,040
say at this moment is that uh

668
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,240
this

669
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:05,680
relation is what I called an extrinsic

670
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:11,800
relation extrinsic

671
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:13,599
means uh that it has been obtained using

672
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,760
only uh

673
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,200
assumptions about the Continuum the

674
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,960
balance equations things that all in

675
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,400
general it doesn't contain anything that

676
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,319
has to do with how the material behaves

677
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,880
it doesn't yet contain any property of

678
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:31,640
the material for example here the

679
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,800
property of the material when you do

680
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:37,680
heat transfer comes in when you write

681
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:41,800
the for LA and therefore you U insert

682
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:45,480
the thermal conductivity tensor which is

683
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,480
uh um the description of which contains

684
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,119
how your system behaves and so that

685
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,119
takes me

686
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:58,400
here in other words

687
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:01,040
uh once we have written the extreme IC

688
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,160
General relation for Sigma then we have

689
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,720
to go into the detail of the particular

690
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,880
problem and the particular material or

691
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:11,160
materials that we are dealing with and

692
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,960
each material has its own

693
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:19,359
way of um

694
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:22,000
reacting uh to fluxes and

695
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:25,200
forces the principle in general is that

696
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,640
the material tends to um

697
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:34,160
spontaneously uh go if it can uh towards

698
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:39,520
a uh stable equilibrium but sometimes if

699
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:41,760
it is subjected to uh permanent forces

700
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:47,079
it will reach a steady

701
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:50,599
state because that those uh um fluxes

702
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:54,079
and forces that are imposed by the by

703
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:56,400
the exterior or by the adjacent fluid

704
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,319
Elements by the flow situation by the

705
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,640
boundary conditions

706
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:02,119
uh

707
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:04,240
those uh prevent the system from

708
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:10,319
relaxing spontaneously to equilibrium so

709
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,319
it will keep the the state of of

710
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:18,800
equilibri and typically uh boundary

711
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:24,720
conditions most of the

712
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:29,200
times uh impose either the forces or the

713
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:32,000
fluxes uh but there sometimes you also U

714
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,160
impose a related a relation between

715
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,599
force and flux like when you do

716
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:42,680
convective heat transfer the that is a

717
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:42,680
boundary condition of U Robin

718
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,760
type

719
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:53,880
uh in any case you can

720
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:59,240
view uh there is a dual point of

721
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:03,280
view you can uh describe

722
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:07,640
your material resistance to flux by

723
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:11,640
saying uh how it is how it

724
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:13,240
reacts uh when you impose some flaxes uh

725
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,319
in

726
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:18,200
it and the material typically reacts to

727
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:22,839
a

728
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:25,880
flux by building up a degree of this

729
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:28,520
equilibrium remember the chatelier brown

730
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:33,359
theorem degree of this equilibrium that

731
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:37,960
will enhance its tendency to uh

732
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,960
contrast that flux and return to

733
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:45,040
equilibrium so your model for for the

734
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,640
material will be a relation that gives

735
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,680
you the force as a function of the flux

736
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,119
and the gamma gamas are the other

737
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,560
properties like equilibrium properties

738
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,599
if you are near equilibrium like

739
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,599
temperatures chemical potentials

740
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,440
electrostatic

741
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,640
field but of course you can also view it

742
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,599
in the opposite way it's just the

743
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:13,240
inverse function or the dual point of

744
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,599
view you impose Force for example you

745
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:19,040
impose a gradient in temperature on a

746
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,960
specimen of a piece of

747
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:27,000
metal and uh the

748
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,680
this the material reacts by building up

749
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,160
a

750
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:35,960
flux which will try to go in the

751
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,319
direction of reestablishing a a flat so

752
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,880
of of killing that temperature gradient

753
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,680
that you are

754
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,920
imposing again

755
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:49,680
uh in this case you write the relation

756
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,680
flux as a function of

757
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,359
force and clearly then you have uh you

758
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,359
put it

759
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:03,200
into the extrinsic formula for the

760
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:08,760
entropy production that we just uh

761
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:12,240
uh obtained and and uh here comes

762
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,200
a relation in in this picture the

763
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,720
entropy production is related to the

764
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,079
fluxes that you have imposed or this one

765
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:23,079
it's related to the forces that you have

766
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,079
imposed

767
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,040
and then you

768
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,800
start particular

769
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,800
models particular but pretty

770
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:45,800
General uh for example here we uh if you

771
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:50,640
want to model the relation between force

772
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:52,480
and flux in heat transfer you adopt the

773
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,760
fu

774
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,720
law which for an isotropic material is

775
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:02,559
doesn't have a tensor here is just a

776
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:06,720
scalar but if it is anisotropic we have

777
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:12,599
seen that this should become a tensor a

778
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,599
symmetric tensor due to the onager

779
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:21,400
reciprocity the relation

780
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,440
between the difference between

781
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,760
mechanical and thermodynamic pressure

782
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:29,119
and

783
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,119
the Divergence of the velocity

784
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:37,319
is called the lamb law of for nutonian

785
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:40,319
fluid and the constant between the two I

786
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:42,040
mean the yeah the the constant of

787
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:45,079
proportionality between the two is

788
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,079
called The Bu

789
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,079
viscosity in

790
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,480
U fluid

791
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:00,680
mechanics the relation between

792
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:04,960
deviatoric part of the stress tensor and

793
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:08,400
deviatoric part of the rate of strain

794
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:11,880
tensor is what we call is this linear

795
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,599
relation and uh the proportionality

796
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:18,040
relation is called the sheer viscosity

797
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:18,040
we typic just call it

798
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,720
viscosity and with this plus

799
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,800
lamb you may rewrite the stress tensor

800
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:29,800
in this

801
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,599
way where notice here that I'm using the

802
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,520
thermodynamic pressure not the

803
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:45,440
mechanical pressure because the

804
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,280
difference between the two has been uh

805
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,599
shifted on this

806
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,920
side to use the

807
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,440
lamb

808
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,160
law and so here you have the standard

809
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,200
stuff and here you have the stuff that

810
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,200
you usually neglect

811
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,880
because this

812
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,800
is

813
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:07,599
typically zero but this is the second

814
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,599
coefficient of

815
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,599
viscosity and then if you have

816
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:20,400
electricity

817
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:20,400
conduction diffusion you have a ohms

818
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:29,680
law the coefficient proportionality

819
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:33,800
between the charge diffusive flux and

820
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:35,760
the gradient in the so minus the

821
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,920
gradient in the electrostatic field is

822
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,880
the is the electric

823
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,800
field so this is you could also write it

824
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,079
as

825
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:50,119
e and in any case this is the inverse of

826
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:50,119
the uh electrical resistivity of your

827
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:57,720
material and this is one way of

828
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:57,720
proceeding and it is

829
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:05,720
it has been the way for most of

830
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:08,720
uh uh the

831
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,720
applications

832
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,280
however there is some

833
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:18,040
arbitrariness

834
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:21,800
in saying as we've seen

835
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:25,960
here that for example the heat transfer

836
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:28,920
is not related to some other U degrees

837
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,920
of dis equilibrium

838
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:35,680
and in fact there is this possibility

839
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,160
and the Matrix of possibilities is is

840
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,319
this

841
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:43,000
one so here is all your degrees of this

842
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:44,599
equilibriums possible ones and here is

843
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,359
all the

844
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:51,839
flues and those laws that we have seen

845
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:55,720
uh in the previous slide are just the

846
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:59,520
diagonal terms in these Matrix of

847
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:03,359
coupling they presume a direct

848
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:07,520
coupling between I mean chemical

849
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:11,839
reaction rate and the Affinity of the

850
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:14,920
reaction uh coupling between these

851
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:16,559
mechanical rate of change of velocity

852
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,280
I'm sorry of volume of the fluid

853
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:21,359
elements and this

854
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:24,200
difference in

855
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:27,480
pressures or these and the the heat

856
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:31,119
transfer and so on so but as you

857
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,599
see at least part of this Matrix is

858
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,800
filled with other

859
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:40,839
possibilities that have names so they

860
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:43,319
correspond to effects that have been

861
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:47,359
observed and long ago as you see they're

862
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:47,359
talking about the 19th century

863
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:57,160
still uh these are typically called

864
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:59,319
cross effect effects because because

865
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:03,480
they happen in the off

866
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:05,720
diagonal terms of these coupling

867
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:08,839
Matrix and also you may have noticed

868
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:11,480
that I haven't put anything in these

869
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:12,920
parts so why don't I fill completely

870
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,319
this matx

871
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,880
Matrix okay well in

872
00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:21,440
principle you you

873
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:25,400
should except that there are

874
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,319
uh many applications in which your uh

875
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,240
fluid is is

876
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:34,599
isotropic okay if the fluid is isotropic

877
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:36,640
if the symmetry of your problem uh the

878
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:40,200
like the

879
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,800
material as well as the boundary

880
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:45,720
conditions are

881
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:49,760
isotropic uh

882
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:52,470
then there is this princip symmetry

883
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,760
U takes

884
00:48:52,470 --> 00:49:01,280
[Music]

885
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:04,640
uh uh it's uh it's saying and it uh it

886
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:07,040
it implements what what what what Pier

887
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:10,200
KY described in with this word that the

888
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,200
symmetry of the cause must be preserved

889
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,640
into its

890
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:17,200
effects

891
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,520
so what this means is that if you are in

892
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:24,680
isotropic conditions there is no way you

893
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:27,640
can couple a phenomenon which is of say

894
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:30,920
vectorial character with one which is of

895
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:34,000
a different character like a scalar or a

896
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,480
tensor so tensors and couple on only

897
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,559
with

898
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:43,960
tensors uh and scolars only with

899
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:46,640
scolars and sorry here the scolars and

900
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:48,319
vectors only with

901
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,400
vectors

902
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:56,000
so for but but remember also that this

903
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,000
is true only for isotropic conditions

904
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:05,400
uh because for example and uh

905
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:07,040
um there is an important uh aspect when

906
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:11,960
you have

907
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:15,359
a for example a

908
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:18,480
uh an interface so this supposed to

909
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:22,520
represent an interface between two

910
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:26,400
phases for example uh let's

911
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:27,400
say F on one side and G on the other

912
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,839
side

913
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:32,400
okay two different phases separated by

914
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:34,880
an

915
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:37,559
interface and an

916
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,799
interface okay let's view it also in

917
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:41,599
this other point of

918
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:44,960
view

919
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:50,280
F and let's plot the

920
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:54,240
density now as we know if we plot the

921
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:58,520
density uh uh of

922
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:59,960
um of a liquid

923
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,559
and the

924
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:05,880
density of a vapor there is a big

925
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:08,480
difference the vapor is about for water

926
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,400
it's about a thousand times less dense

927
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,200
than the

928
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:17,480
liquid so in the

929
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:19,119
interface things are not sharp things

930
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:21,920
are

931
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,680
smooth there is a smooth inter interface

932
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:28,280
there is a lay there is

933
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:29,400
a a a small layer in which there is this

934
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,880
a

935
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:35,079
huge gradient in

936
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,319
density and this is at

937
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:39,720
equilibrium so this is not a kind of

938
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:43,200
gradient that would cause

939
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:45,520
uh uh fluxes it's not it's not a degree

940
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,280
of this equilibrium this happens at

941
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,880
equilibrium but still you have a

942
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,359
gradient

943
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:56,559
there

944
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:56,559
and the description of this situation

945
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,559
can be done in several ways Gibbs did it

946
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:07,520
by assuming a sharp

947
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:11,880
equivalent jump from this value to that

948
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:15,599
value which is a good uh approach and uh

949
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,920
uh I will direct you to a very nice

950
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:21,319
paper

951
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:27,760
by uh bed mazour and another author I

952
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:30,119
forget the name now uh that um does

953
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,280
writes exactly the equations that we

954
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:34,680
have written here

955
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:37,000
this this um

956
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:41,079
extrinsic relation for

957
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:45,079
Sigma uh in the case of a jump

958
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:47,200
description between two

959
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:49,760
uh between two

960
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:54,400
phases

961
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:58,440
okay uh in in this situation here

962
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,440
definitely there is no uh isotop

963
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:08,839
because one thing is to move uh

964
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:11,960
across uh this interface and one thing

965
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:14,520
is move to move along the interface so

966
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:19,359
uh if you if you sit on the interface

967
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:22,000
and move uh on the on the interfacial

968
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:26,640
region okay

969
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:29,319
maybe that is isotropic

970
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:33,240
in the tangent

971
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:35,920
Direction but it's not uh in the uh

972
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:38,160
orthogonal Direction so for example in

973
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,160
this

974
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,799
case uh the the stress

975
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:52,040
tensor which is a you know you can

976
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:52,040
represent it uh in as a 3X3 Matrix

977
00:53:52,200 --> 00:54:00,640
splits uh and and so you you have uh a a

978
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:04,640
a pressure an orthogonal pressure and a

979
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:07,319
tangent pressure and a tangent tensor uh

980
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:12,200
tensor field so you have a

981
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:14,720
two-dimensional uh tensor field which is

982
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:18,359
um

983
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:24,400
isotropic represents the stress

984
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:24,400
component in the tangential part plus a

985
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:31,040
scalar a scalar for the the orthogonal

986
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:34,119
pressure becomes a

987
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:36,119
scalar and uh so in this

988
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:39,359
situation this is very interesting

989
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:41,440
because that scalar now since it is a

990
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:45,040
scalar it can

991
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:49,880
couple with all these scalars

992
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:53,359
here so you may have the possibility at

993
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:57,000
interfacing and interfaces to

994
00:54:53,359 --> 00:55:00,640
couple uh chemistry

995
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:04,799
and uh the flow field and the the

996
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,799
pressure field the the orthogonal

997
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:20,640
pressure and that is uh used that is um

998
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:20,640
I think uh used in models also for

999
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:28,319
biological biological systems because

1000
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:31,680
that that coupling is

1001
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:35,079
important so it's mechanical mechanical

1002
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:37,400
and chemical uh

1003
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:40,680
coupling but you need to break the

1004
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:43,480
isotropic the isotropy uh in order to

1005
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,480
have this kind

1006
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:48,680
of say exotic

1007
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:56,400
couplings

1008
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:59,520
now we have already talk uh talked about

1009
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:02,160
Saga relations and you remember that we

1010
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:06,039
we did it in the context of chemical

1011
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:09,359
reactions and we did it we

1012
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:11,680
proved the the reciprocity on sag

1013
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:13,520
reciprocity theorem you we've shown that

1014
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,680
in the linear regime we could prove it

1015
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:21,480
as a consequence of the principle of

1016
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,480
Maximum entropy production by

1017
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,920
Ziggler

1018
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,359
here I'm not

1019
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,760
discussing this slide a lot a lot

1020
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:35,880
because essentially it is exactly the

1021
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:39,160
same slide that we had then where I

1022
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:43,760
changed some of the symbols here instead

1023
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:45,839
of Sigma we had entropy production s

1024
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:50,000
dot

1025
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:53,119
irreversible here we had the reaction

1026
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,520
rate so the Epsilon dots and here we had

1027
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:59,280
the affinities of the reactions and

1028
00:56:55,520 --> 00:57:01,359
instead of of uh

1029
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:05,079
this

1030
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:07,760
super dot symbol we just said nothing

1031
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:07,760
because they were

1032
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:15,799
Scholars and the procedure was just the

1033
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:18,039
same we we we proved we we

1034
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:21,079
assumed that the

1035
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:23,760
material in the linear regime so we

1036
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:26,520
assume a linear

1037
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:31,720
relation and the linear relation is

1038
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:34,119
therefore uh in terms of this um tensor

1039
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,119
here

1040
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:39,960
L it's actually a super tensor because

1041
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:42,720
it's uh it's it has as many entries as

1042
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,520
that metrix that we just uh had in the

1043
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:48,640
previous

1044
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:51,559
slide uh with some zeros around but uh

1045
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,920
it's it's not a full because of the K

1046
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:57,079
principle but it's

1047
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:59,520
still okay so this

1048
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:02,000
is what we assume a linear

1049
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:06,400
relation and the bottom line will be

1050
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,400
that this super tensor has to be

1051
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:12,920
symmetric and uh the Assumption in order

1052
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,920
to obtain this

1053
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:19,599
result is that the uh entropy production

1054
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:24,599
should be maximal subject to the

1055
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:28,400
constraint given by the extrinsic

1056
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:29,559
relation and in in passing we uh obtain

1057
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,920
this

1058
00:58:29,559 --> 00:58:36,240
orthogonality uh Ziggler orthogonality

1059
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:41,200
relation that we also described

1060
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,200
graphically in one of the previous

1061
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:48,480
lectures

1062
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:48,480
okay so okay fine you can proceed this

1063
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:54,839
way U Ziggler actually introduced this

1064
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:59,280
this um idea of Maximum entropy

1065
00:58:54,839 --> 00:59:03,200
production because his uh objective was

1066
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:06,599
to he was a material science I guess uh

1067
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:10,839
person and uh he wanted to be able to

1068
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:14,280
describe things like

1069
00:59:10,839 --> 00:59:17,359
plasticity uh and

1070
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:21,839
plasticity doesn't have a linear regime

1071
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:26,240
so he wanted to extend uh on Sager

1072
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:29,839
reciprocity to uh nonlinear regimes and

1073
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:32,599
in fact here is how you do it again I

1074
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:34,319
just skip the details but just to give

1075
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:37,079
you a

1076
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:39,319
flavor all it takes is to instead of

1077
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:42,440
assuming like we did in the previous

1078
00:59:39,319 --> 00:59:45,960
Slide the linear relation

1079
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:48,920
between forces and flaxes we assume a

1080
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,920
generic relation

1081
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:54,240
J and still apply the principle of

1082
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:58,680
Maximum entry production so maximize

1083
00:59:54,240 --> 01:00:00,400
Sigma subject to to the extrinsic uh

1084
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:03,200
relation for

1085
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,880
the between forces and

1086
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,520
flaxes and you come up with an

1087
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,680
orthogonality

1088
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,839
condition in terms of the lrange

1089
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:15,200
multiplier which is still only one

1090
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:15,200
because it's still only one

1091
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:21,319
constraint the only problem is that

1092
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:23,440
now remember when you have a in the

1093
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:25,359
method of lrange multipliers you in

1094
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,079
order to find the value of the lrange

1095
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:29,640
multiplier you have to uh substitute

1096
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:32,319
back into the constraint so you take

1097
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,359
this orthogonality relation this way put

1098
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:35,640
it back in the constraint and this is

1099
01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:40,440
done

1100
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:43,200
here and then solve for uh

1101
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:45,839
Lambda in the case of linear case we

1102
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:48,039
found that Lambda is equal to two here

1103
01:00:45,839 --> 01:00:50,160
it's more complicated because Lambda is

1104
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:53,760
a is this

1105
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:57,920
function of whatever functional form you

1106
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:00,280
have chosen for your uh um relations

1107
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,880
between forces and fluxes which is

1108
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:04,720
nonlinear in

1109
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:07,760
general so you can substitute this into

1110
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:10,319
here and you get this complicated stuff

1111
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,400
which nevertheless is a is an

1112
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:14,960
orthogonality it's a

1113
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:19,880
condition that must be satisfied by the

1114
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:22,079
functional relation of your uh of your

1115
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:24,359
um that you have chosen here so it tells

1116
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,920
you that you don't have complete freedom

1117
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:29,119
in choosing these functions they have to

1118
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,039
satisfy

1119
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:35,440
this for example if you if you choose

1120
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:38,559
the the linear relation which is this

1121
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:41,880
one this

1122
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:46,400
expression uh reduces to the

1123
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:50,520
one that required the symmetry of the

1124
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:54,000
Dion Sager conductivity uh

1125
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:57,760
tensor in a general case you get

1126
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,359
something else uh which is a sort of a

1127
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,039
generalization to nonlinear case

1128
01:02:00,359 --> 01:02:06,839
of

1129
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:06,839
of of on Saga relation Al

1130
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:19,520
Ziggler there is another uh way of

1131
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:19,520
viewing uh things they're all sort of

1132
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:31,440
equivalent and uh let me try to explain

1133
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:34,079
it in this

1134
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,680
uh heat transfer

1135
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:40,680
example they are all equivalent and uh

1136
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:45,680
there's so much and as you see I'll I'll

1137
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:48,279
say a little bit later about this uh u i

1138
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:51,160
collected this point of view in in a

1139
01:02:48,279 --> 01:02:52,760
paper couple of years

1140
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:57,319
ago

1141
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:57,319
uh and u

1142
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,760
let's let's do it for the heat transfer

1143
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:09,200
case so

1144
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:13,359
consider this anisotropic material made

1145
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:16,680
of so that micr structure is made of

1146
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:19,520
layers um

1147
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:22,240
sandwiched of high conductivity and low

1148
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,240
conductivity

1149
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:30,319
materials and so suppose you

1150
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:35,160
subject this

1151
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:41,279
material to a you impose a gradient in

1152
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:43,760
temperature so material then is

1153
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:46,279
under I shouldn't say stress but in any

1154
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:50,960
case it's it has to decide all right how

1155
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:53,799
do I react to that um gradient in

1156
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,799
temperature that you

1157
01:03:54,440 --> 01:04:00,680
impose uh

1158
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:08,400
definitely want to react in a way that

1159
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:11,760
will allow me to uh like Brown says H to

1160
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:14,559
reduce that gradient in temperature and

1161
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,559
try to reestablish

1162
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,559
equilibrium

1163
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:26,680
but you see here what I'm am showing is

1164
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:29,799
that there are many possibilities it

1165
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:33,480
could uh decide to move heat in One

1166
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:36,720
Direction or in another and how come it

1167
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:36,720
chooses this particular

1168
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:41,640
direction in some

1169
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:49,920
sense uh it's like um suppose you are in

1170
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:53,559
a in a in a crowd you're in the middle

1171
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:55,920
of a lot of people uh maybe at a concert

1172
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:58,680
or

1173
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,920
going into or out of a soccer stadium

1174
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:04,640
lots of people and everybody wants to

1175
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:08,279
reach or get next to the the podium or

1176
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:10,839
to the entrance or go or go to your car

1177
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:13,039
but you have a crowd in front of you and

1178
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:15,039
so uh even

1179
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:20,160
though uh the

1180
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:23,160
direct path would be apparently shorter

1181
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:25,839
but it would require less effort for you

1182
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:29,440
to move in another Direction where you

1183
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:31,839
see less uh resistance to to to your

1184
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:35,359
motion okay

1185
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:38,319
so this is a this is what happens here

1186
01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:40,160
so there is you you

1187
01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:44,480
evaluate and the

1188
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:46,359
material uh does a a local

1189
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:49,119
evaluation uh

1190
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:52,279
sensing okay how much would would it

1191
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:56,119
cost me to move in in terms of effort no

1192
01:05:52,279 --> 01:05:59,119
or in terms of uh yes effort in order to

1193
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:01,039
move in the crowd how how much would it

1194
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:02,000
cost me to go in this direction or in

1195
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:05,799
that

1196
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,039
direction and so there is a this tensor

1197
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:13,920
G which I would call a

1198
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:15,880
metric it's the driver of that logic it

1199
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:20,079
measures

1200
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:21,319
uh uh how dissipative is uh moving in

1201
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:24,880
the various

1202
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:26,920
directions and if you write an equation

1203
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,760
like this

1204
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:33,000
you

1205
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:34,240
you this is a quadratic form with with

1206
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:39,119
that

1207
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:43,039
g uh for given um heat

1208
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:46,000
fluxes and that it equal to some

1209
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:48,160
constant that gives you an equation of

1210
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,520
an

1211
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:54,079
ellipsoid and that ellipsoid represents

1212
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:59,319
the locus of all

1213
01:06:54,079 --> 01:07:02,799
the uh tips of the vectors that uh would

1214
01:06:59,319 --> 01:07:05,160
cost the material the same effort so the

1215
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:08,160
same

1216
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:08,160
um

1217
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:16,319
dissipation and so it turns

1218
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:19,799
out

1219
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:21,839
that you know the the entropy production

1220
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:25,960
is the scalar product between the blue

1221
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:28,079
vector and the red vector

1222
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:31,359
okay and the scalar product

1223
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:34,119
here between two vectors is given by the

1224
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:36,319
projection of one vector onto the onto

1225
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:38,279
the other one so for example this blue

1226
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:43,520
one you see that this blue one the

1227
01:07:38,279 --> 01:07:45,839
actual uh full not the dotted ones is

1228
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:48,760
the one that has the maximum projection

1229
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:52,240
onto the red Vector so the maximize it

1230
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:54,440
maximizes among all these possibilities

1231
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:58,559
that have equal

1232
01:07:54,440 --> 01:08:01,480
effort the one that uh maximizes the

1233
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:04,240
sigma is this blue one and that's the

1234
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:04,240
one that the material

1235
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:15,600
chooses uh it turns out that g is the

1236
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:19,679
inverse of the conductivity

1237
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:23,920
tensor so you can read for

1238
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:27,159
law with the for an anisotropic material

1239
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:31,040
in in this way that the material

1240
01:08:27,159 --> 01:08:35,719
is is choosing the direction

1241
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:38,679
of maximal entropy production for a

1242
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:38,679
given

1243
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:45,319
effort like in your crowd you choose the

1244
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:49,319
Direction with with which you feel that

1245
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:51,920
you are moving uh farther away with this

1246
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:54,000
with with a given effort for a given

1247
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:57,000
amount of effort that you put into that

1248
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
movement

1249
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:03,400
okay so these are words just to explain

1250
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:07,080
what

1251
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,080
uh what I just

1252
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:10,319
said

1253
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,759
and so if

1254
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:25,920
you so you you could have a an isotropic

1255
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:27,920
material for an isotropic material

1256
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,960
that ellipsoid becomes a

1257
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,799
sphere a

1258
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:37,040
hypersphere all directions are

1259
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:37,040
equivalent and if all directions are

1260
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:43,679
equivalent which one is the direction of

1261
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:49,120
steepest entropy scent it's the same as

1262
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:52,120
the gradient of of T because Vector

1263
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,120
Q

1264
01:09:52,679 --> 01:10:01,560
uh as the maximal projection of on on on

1265
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,560
on the red Vector when they are Co

1266
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:09,800
colinear and so here's

1267
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:12,760
the the construction in the same diagram

1268
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,960
for which we have seen

1269
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,840
the uh the

1270
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:19,840
orthogonality

1271
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,840
Ziggler

1272
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:28,480
relation so we have

1273
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:30,120
a an ex y or one and

1274
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:35,159
two

1275
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:41,159
versors so think of it X and Y I impose

1276
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:41,159
a gradient in temperature which has two

1277
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:51,760
components and

1278
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:55,480
uh uh that places me the two

1279
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:57,080
components places me somewhere not at

1280
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:59,080
equilibrium if there if there are zero

1281
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:00,880
I'm at the center so I'm already in an

1282
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:03,920
equilibrium State and nothing happens

1283
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:06,960
but if you I'm off equilibrium these are

1284
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:09,600
the lines of Contours of constant

1285
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:13,040
entropy no so the higher the gradient

1286
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:15,239
the farther I am and the highest is the

1287
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,239
uh

1288
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:25,719
entropy I'm sorry the the highest is the

1289
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,719
degree of this equilibrium

1290
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:30,719
this is the maximum entropy so this is

1291
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,960
the uh the entropy goes decreasing as I

1292
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,960
go

1293
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:44,280
further so if I um am here

1294
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:46,639
and and that degree of dis equilibrium

1295
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:48,960
has been generated at one instant of

1296
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:51,800
time and then the system is allowed to

1297
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:55,760
evolve by itself as if were isolated

1298
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:59,679
nothing else uh no constraints just

1299
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,679
you can go to

1300
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:08,360
equilibrium it doesn't go to

1301
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:12,560
equilibrium in the straight path it

1302
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:16,800
follows the path that is dictated by its

1303
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:19,760
local metric now true the uh isotropic

1304
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:23,239
material is

1305
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:25,880
um doesn't favor any direction so these

1306
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:28,880
although it doesn't show exactly as a as

1307
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:34,719
a sphere it should be a circle in any

1308
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:36,840
case uh it has to um evolve though in a

1309
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:39,960
scenario in

1310
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:42,520
which the entropy contour lines may not

1311
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:46,280
be also circles if they were also

1312
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:48,000
circles you would go down straight but

1313
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:53,920
if they are not like here they are

1314
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:57,239
ellipses then uh it it would choose no

1315
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:59,719
among uh the ones that are all

1316
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:02,639
equivalent effort you chooses the one

1317
01:12:59,719 --> 01:13:05,560
that takes you to the highest entropy

1318
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:09,639
possible so it's the one that is tangent

1319
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:11,760
here and that is also for this other

1320
01:13:09,639 --> 01:13:16,600
metric and then of course you can

1321
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:20,920
proceed and go on as you at each

1322
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:23,560
point you you sort stop and pause I it

1323
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:25,360
doesn't happen of course but stop and

1324
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:28,840
consider which one is the direction in

1325
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:31,920
which I should go next step and that's

1326
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:34,199
how it how it gets to equilibrium they

1327
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:37,239
all get to equilibrium of course but

1328
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:40,000
along different paths and if I start

1329
01:13:37,239 --> 01:13:45,320
even from this exactly same state but

1330
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:47,679
with a material that is uh uh that has a

1331
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:51,920
that is oriented

1332
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:55,560
differently and therefore uh for for it

1333
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:59,960
the the

1334
01:13:55,560 --> 01:14:03,760
the metric uh and these ellipsoids of

1335
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:05,440
equal dissipation or equal effort is

1336
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:08,880
oriented in a different way and

1337
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:12,520
therefore it would move there and then

1338
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:15,719
it will search again and it will move

1339
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:21,920
maybe even overshoots a little bit and

1340
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:25,800
then goes back to equili okay so this is

1341
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,880
U the role of uh

1342
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:30,239
the

1343
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,400
metric that uh

1344
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:35,040
describes this is for a heat transfer

1345
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,880
problem but you can also view it in a

1346
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:42,679
more General

1347
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:45,120
context and that is what I I I like to

1348
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:49,159
call it the fourth

1349
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:50,920
flow simply because it is a something

1350
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:54,120
that

1351
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:56,400
has emerged let me see do I have oh I

1352
01:14:54,120 --> 01:15:00,000
think I had a

1353
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:02,239
uh keep missing slides today uh there

1354
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,440
there will be a slide somewhere

1355
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:09,120
sometime with a list

1356
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:13,120
of uh many different theories of non

1357
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:16,400
equilibrium over the last 40 years H in

1358
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:19,639
which people uh in different languages

1359
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:21,880
different mathematics different uh

1360
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:24,520
Frameworks often they don't talk to each

1361
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:26,280
other they completely ignore each other

1362
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:28,120
uh they admit that they're doing the

1363
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:31,400
same thing but they are doing the same

1364
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:36,239
thing and that is uh what I was trying

1365
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:38,560
to to point out to to the community here

1366
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:39,800
by calling it The for forth flow and why

1367
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:44,880
why do

1368
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:48,239
I uh why do I dare uh elevating it to

1369
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:51,840
such a high level in the hierarchy of of

1370
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:54,520
of physical laws okay that's

1371
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:56,199
because uh because of the generality you

1372
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:58,920
know remember the great great

1373
01:15:56,199 --> 01:16:02,679
conservation principles

1374
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:03,520
are are great the greatness comes from

1375
01:16:02,679 --> 01:16:06,360
the

1376
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:09,480
generality should should hold for every

1377
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:11,760
model of physical reality well it turns

1378
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:15,840
out that in every model of non-e

1379
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:17,880
equilibrium uh Dynamics U there is

1380
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:20,719
something that maybe you don't call it a

1381
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:22,040
metric uh but it is it has the

1382
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:26,040
properties of a

1383
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:28,840
metric and uh uh

1384
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:31,560
and therefore it is it appears to be an

1385
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:33,320
essential feature of any

1386
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:39,199
model and

1387
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:43,000
also uh I like also the fact that it is

1388
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:44,400
a is a statement of existence like like

1389
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,440
the first law is a statement of

1390
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:50,440
existence of energy the second law is a

1391
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:53,000
statement of existence of entropy this

1392
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:55,520
is a statement of existence of a metric

1393
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,320
in non-e equilibrium States another it's

1394
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:00,520
a

1395
01:16:56,320 --> 01:17:03,440
property like this thermal

1396
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:06,880
conductivity uh that has to be

1397
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:09,280
defined at every uh state every

1398
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:12,040
non-equilibrium state of your system for

1399
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:14,800
it to decide in which direction to move

1400
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:18,000
when you let it alone and want to and

1401
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,000
let it go towards

1402
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,840
equilibrium yeah uh

1403
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:34,320
here this is to show that this same

1404
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:37,880
construction can be also uh

1405
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:42,960
done more formally and mathematically

1406
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:42,960
again with the method of lrange

1407
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:52,400
multipliers you you see you maximize the

1408
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:55,400
scalar product between the X and the

1409
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:59,480
J subject

1410
01:17:55,400 --> 01:18:03,440
so that's the the lrange multiplier to

1411
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:06,560
the constraint given by an equal effort

1412
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:08,280
ellipsoid so if I have so it expresses

1413
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,719
exactly

1414
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:12,719
mathematically uh the worthy description

1415
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:15,719
that I

1416
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:19,520
gave there is a matric that descri

1417
01:18:15,719 --> 01:18:21,480
describes this ellipsoid tells you for a

1418
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,840
given distance I want to move which one

1419
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:29,960
is the best Direction and best is in

1420
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:32,440
terms of maximizing the rate of entropy

1421
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:35,719
production from this

1422
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:37,880
one using the method the gr multiplier

1423
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:41,159
setting the derivative equal to

1424
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:45,199
zero U substituting back into constraint

1425
01:18:41,159 --> 01:18:48,080
and so on you get a relation between

1426
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:48,080
forces and

1427
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:53,600
fluxes we can you can always write it in

1428
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:56,080
in this way which looks like a linear

1429
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,360
relation but it's not because this R

1430
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,840
which is a

1431
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:02,199
resistance

1432
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:06,159
um it's

1433
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:09,080
not constant in general but it's just a

1434
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:12,320
function of the fluis which is given by

1435
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:16,520
the solution of this problem

1436
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:16,520
here so this is a nonlinear

1437
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:26,000
relation and of course you can do the

1438
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:28,159
exact uh same in the uh Force picture

1439
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:32,880
pause the the

1440
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:35,920
X and there is a a metric also from that

1441
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:39,120
point of view and the two are related to

1442
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:41,560
one another they the inverse

1443
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:44,520
somehow so you also

1444
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:47,320
maximize these projection subject to

1445
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:50,639
this other blue ellipsoid which also

1446
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:53,199
represents the

1447
01:19:50,639 --> 01:19:56,239
effort at this time it's the effort for

1448
01:19:53,199 --> 01:20:01,679
the system to set up

1449
01:19:56,239 --> 01:20:04,639
uh a a gradient in temperature so as to

1450
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:09,520
contrast the flux

1451
01:20:04,639 --> 01:20:14,480
of heat that you have imposed in it and

1452
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:16,320
of course when you get close to

1453
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:19,320
equilibrium when you get close to

1454
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:22,880
equilibrium then you go to the linear uh

1455
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:27,000
regime you get on Saga relations and of

1456
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:28,520
course these two are um the metric

1457
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:32,040
becomes

1458
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:34,480
the uh onager

1459
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:38,000
generalized

1460
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:41,120
conductivity for the L's or resistivity

1461
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,719
for the r for the

1462
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:47,639
RS one is the inverse of the

1463
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:48,719
other ah there is okay here is the the

1464
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:50,800
list

1465
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:53,639
of uh

1466
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:56,719
theories uh that

1467
01:20:53,639 --> 01:21:00,080
uh converge

1468
01:20:56,719 --> 01:21:03,080
to the four

1469
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,080
FL

1470
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:14,040
uh of course we contributed to

1471
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:19,400
it but u in the same period already you

1472
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:22,360
have Gela morison cavman who did the

1473
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:28,679
uh completely from completely different

1474
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:31,679
point of view so in fact I I met

1475
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:35,639
Miroslav Gela

1476
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,639
only maybe 30 years

1477
01:21:35,719 --> 01:21:46,000
later and so these all

1478
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:49,719
are uh independent uh

1479
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:51,960
contributions uh generic has become very

1480
01:21:49,719 --> 01:21:54,000
popular because some Compu some

1481
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:57,960
communities are more effective than

1482
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,880
others to propagating and

1483
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:02,360
Publishing

1484
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:04,280
U I will say a few words also about the

1485
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:09,760
Constructor law Bean

1486
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:13,000
although he would be unhappy if I

1487
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:16,560
say that he belongs here because I think

1488
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:19,000
he believes that his uh point of view is

1489
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:22,320
more General and I think I agree with

1490
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:25,520
him uh I'll explain a moment I mean

1491
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:28,480
later when why

1492
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:31,280
uh these other also some

1493
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:33,480
mathematicians from the point of view of

1494
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:35,040
certain classes of partial differential

1495
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:38,880
equations have

1496
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:43,960
developed uh now it's already 25 years

1497
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,960
uh ago um this theory of gradient

1498
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:52,840
flows uh

1499
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:55,920
they in order to do that they have

1500
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:58,440
introduced a part particular metric

1501
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:02,159
pretty complicated mathematical but it

1502
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:04,760
is a metric that regularizes those

1503
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:09,239
differential equations and make make

1504
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:11,520
them fit into this same scheme so that's

1505
01:23:09,239 --> 01:23:11,520
very

1506
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:17,920
interesting uh okay then there is also

1507
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:20,040
more modern stuff like large deviation

1508
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:23,280
Theory

1509
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:25,880
Theory and not only that but also there

1510
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:29,679
is some people

1511
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:31,639
um that are

1512
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:38,320
applying

1513
01:23:31,639 --> 01:23:40,800
this notion to solve in original way

1514
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:46,040
uh complicated

1515
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:49,440
problems in a much simpler way than um

1516
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:51,360
the traditional

1517
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:54,960
descriptions

1518
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:57,360
because this view uh geometrical

1519
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:00,400
View ER you know the power of

1520
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:02,520
mathematics and of geometry is if you if

1521
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:04,960
you can uh view something from a

1522
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:07,040
geometrical point of view you have you

1523
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:11,480
you've captured the essence and youve

1524
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:14,639
also often simplified uh the uh even the

1525
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:16,440
numeric uh numerical uh Solutions of

1526
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:18,760
your

1527
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:21,880
problem I'll give you some references

1528
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:22,800
here just for for fun if you're

1529
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:27,159
interested

1530
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:29,600
in now regarding Bean Constructor

1531
01:24:27,159 --> 01:24:34,239
law

1532
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:37,000
uh if you haven't uh come across uh

1533
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:40,639
Adrian Bean was a graduate of this

1534
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:44,360
department uh two or three years before

1535
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:46,320
me I guess he did PhD in mechanical

1536
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:51,199
engineering

1537
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:51,199
here and U is

1538
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:57,000
um you see his Focus

1539
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,080
is

1540
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:03,679
uh uh

1541
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:06,239
on design and evolution in nature the

1542
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:09,880
role of design now

1543
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:13,600
design uh for

1544
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:16,119
example uh the structure of the tree

1545
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:19,960
structure of uh

1546
01:25:16,119 --> 01:25:23,960
lungs or even the structure of trees

1547
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:25,520
which are sorts of U optimiz the result

1548
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:28,000
of

1549
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:31,639
optimization

1550
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:34,040
of of uh of two con contrasting

1551
01:25:31,639 --> 01:25:38,199
Tendencies and the system is trying to

1552
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:43,719
find the best direction in which to uh

1553
01:25:38,199 --> 01:25:46,000
to to build and to uh but uh in which to

1554
01:25:43,719 --> 01:25:51,280
make things

1555
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:52,639
flow and things flow to me is also uh

1556
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,840
translated

1557
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:57,920
into uh

1558
01:25:54,840 --> 01:26:02,080
choose uh the way in which you can

1559
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:04,679
produce as much as possible your entropy

1560
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:07,080
uh at the at the fastest rate compatible

1561
01:26:04,679 --> 01:26:09,280
with the constraints and so for this

1562
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:13,679
part I think that we're saying the same

1563
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:18,119
thing so he also fitting into the forlow

1564
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:22,199
but what the uh what's beyond that and I

1565
01:26:18,119 --> 01:26:25,119
think is right is that uh he's saying

1566
01:26:22,199 --> 01:26:26,760
that u in nature

1567
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:33,639
things

1568
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:36,880
evolve uh and uh also the design of uh

1569
01:26:33,639 --> 01:26:39,119
natural things including the design for

1570
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:45,360
example of the wings of

1571
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:48,360
animals and how they uh how um they

1572
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:53,239
are related

1573
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:59,639
to to Evolution so how

1574
01:26:53,239 --> 01:27:02,760
um the from the I forget the names of uh

1575
01:26:59,639 --> 01:27:05,480
the the ancient uh

1576
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:10,880
Birds uh when you had the

1577
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:13,560
T-Rex and uh and and how that evolved

1578
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:17,320
and that evolution is an evolution in

1579
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:21,080
the design of how uh structures are

1580
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:25,639
built in nature they always have the

1581
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:28,800
purpose of uh favoring flows that means

1582
01:27:25,639 --> 01:27:32,840
uh favoring entropy generation and

1583
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:36,520
making it as as as effective as possible

1584
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:38,440
because as you know uh life is

1585
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:41,199
impossible without entropy generation

1586
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:43,840
and we need that uh that is the the

1587
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:45,800
driving force while you produce entropy

1588
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:48,840
you also produce useful

1589
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:50,600
things so entropy production is not

1590
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:55,560
completely

1591
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:57,560
negative it's not just a waste of exergy

1592
01:27:55,560 --> 01:28:00,400
it's you need it because if you didn't

1593
01:27:57,560 --> 01:28:04,199
have it you nothing useful would

1594
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:08,320
happen uh but what Bean says is that

1595
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:10,679
also uh structures

1596
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:12,239
evolve and

1597
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:15,679
uh

1598
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:19,639
uh the choice there is some Randomness

1599
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:23,119
in how uh a particular

1600
01:28:19,639 --> 01:28:26,760
structure uh is given

1601
01:28:23,119 --> 01:28:29,920
birth it was nonexistent and then all of

1602
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:32,320
a sudden perhaps because of of of of a

1603
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:36,800
fluctuation or

1604
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:41,679
perturbation uh uh it becomes

1605
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:41,679
possible uh now regarding structure

1606
01:28:43,320 --> 01:28:49,159
though for example there is this problem

1607
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:52,360
of the it's

1608
01:28:49,159 --> 01:28:55,520
called Berard

1609
01:28:52,360 --> 01:29:00,440
uh conduction it's it's a problem in

1610
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:02,600
which you um you

1611
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:05,880
hit you have a

1612
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:09,840
fluid and like you have a pan with some

1613
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:11,520
oil and you have Heen from below and

1614
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:14,520
cooled from

1615
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,520
above

1616
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:21,280
uh now

1617
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:25,360
typically if

1618
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:28,679
you if your heating is is is is not

1619
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:30,679
strong enough you would have just a

1620
01:29:28,679 --> 01:29:33,400
conduction but

1621
01:29:30,679 --> 01:29:36,520
then there is also the possibility

1622
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:39,320
because of the instability uh due to the

1623
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:43,199
fact that uh the stratification is you

1624
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:48,040
get hot stuff below and cold above and

1625
01:29:43,199 --> 01:29:53,000
and they like to switch so this uh

1626
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:56,679
movement which requires uh moving a flow

1627
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:58,199
therefore it involves friction so if

1628
01:29:56,679 --> 01:30:01,639
you

1629
01:29:58,199 --> 01:30:05,199
if if if you have

1630
01:30:01,639 --> 01:30:08,080
enough uh motivation for doing it

1631
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:11,000
eventually that flow will start and

1632
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:12,639
therefore you'll get U convective it you

1633
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:17,639
will switch from conductive heat

1634
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:19,480
transfer to convective roles of uh heat

1635
01:30:17,639 --> 01:30:22,199
conduction which will

1636
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:26,159
enhance the heat conduction it's more

1637
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:28,719
effective so you here it is a a

1638
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:33,400
situation in which you you build

1639
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:37,480
structure gets built in order to uh make

1640
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:37,480
uh the entropy production more

1641
01:30:37,639 --> 01:30:41,400
effective and in this

1642
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:49,400
paper uh you view it from the point of

1643
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:51,960
view of U um of of Maximum entropy

1644
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:55,119
production

1645
01:30:51,960 --> 01:31:00,880
so you see for example here you have a

1646
01:30:55,119 --> 01:31:00,880
situation in which uh like you

1647
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:09,440
are for example you have the the rolls

1648
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:11,639
so you have the high non-e equilibrium

1649
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:16,040
situation high flux in which you have

1650
01:31:11,639 --> 01:31:18,560
the Riley Berard rols and those that

1651
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:20,440
structure is the one that maximizes the

1652
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,320
the entropy so among all the

1653
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:25,360
possibilities the system chooses that

1654
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:31,280
one maximizes the entropy product

1655
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:32,960
ction but as you turn uh the heat off

1656
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:38,280
and here you're

1657
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:39,840
going so as time goes on you reduce that

1658
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:42,360
the heat from Bel

1659
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,880
below

1660
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:47,960
uh

1661
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:51,199
that tendency goes down

1662
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:55,719
until uh it becomes

1663
01:31:51,199 --> 01:31:58,719
comparable or or even less efficient

1664
01:31:55,719 --> 01:32:00,159
than the the direct simple conduction

1665
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:04,679
and then what happens the system

1666
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:07,840
switches and the convection gets uh

1667
01:32:04,679 --> 01:32:10,760
stopped and the the system switches into

1668
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:13,360
just to another to the to another

1669
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:16,080
maximum so this is also a

1670
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:17,719
jump in configuration so it's a

1671
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:21,239
construction

1672
01:32:17,719 --> 01:32:24,280
of it's a design so so to speak a design

1673
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:26,520
choice that your system has made in

1674
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:28,920
order to move from one maximum to

1675
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,920
another

1676
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:37,400
maximum and this of course

1677
01:32:33,639 --> 01:32:43,880
corresponds to a critical value of the

1678
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:46,400
rile number that is uh the onset number

1679
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:48,719
for uh this Riley

1680
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:51,840
benar

1681
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:53,480
instability which is very very famous

1682
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,840
problem in fluid mechanics and heat

1683
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:55,840
trans

1684
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:04,560
and by the way Adrian

1685
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:08,400
ban has

1686
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:10,840
written hundreds of papers but also many

1687
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:15,760
books including one at the beginning

1688
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:15,760
which is entropy production in heat

1689
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:22,600
transfer which is uh very good

1690
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:31,239
let me uh conclude today with this um um

1691
01:33:29,719 --> 01:33:35,100
last

1692
01:33:31,239 --> 01:33:38,149
idea just to add to the confusion if you

1693
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:38,149
[Music]

1694
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:43,600
want

1695
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:46,280
um the idea that there is a there is a

1696
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:49,159
theorem famous theorem proved by

1697
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:49,159
glandorf and

1698
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:55,719
PRI called minimum entropy production PR

1699
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:03,800
so many people uh we are facing simply

1700
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:06,560
the the words in a superficial way they

1701
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:09,000
say well is it minimum or is it

1702
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:11,679
maximum

1703
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:16,040
okay all right so the difference in the

1704
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:16,040
key is local and

1705
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:25,199
Global so the the system

1706
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:28,000
locally chooses

1707
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:31,920
uh so the material locally chooses to

1708
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:34,600
react in a in a direction that goes

1709
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:39,239
towards the steepest entropy asent so

1710
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:39,239
it's the local maximal entropy

1711
01:34:39,719 --> 01:34:46,639
production this theorem instead looks at

1712
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:50,880
a global situation like an integral over

1713
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:53,760
a volume of many pieces of material and

1714
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:56,080
it takes it does the integral not of

1715
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:59,199
Sigma that which is the rate of but of

1716
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:59,199
the rate of change of

1717
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:03,520
Sigma and it

1718
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:09,080
proves

1719
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:12,840
that the rate of change of

1720
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:14,239
Sigma under a broad set of boundary

1721
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:15,520
conditions and assumptions that are

1722
01:35:14,239 --> 01:35:19,080
listed

1723
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:20,760
there very larger set of

1724
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:24,440
conditions

1725
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:27,920
is negative

1726
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:30,280
so that means that Sigma if you if you

1727
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:31,840
start like in the previous slide if you

1728
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:36,960
start

1729
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:41,239
uh from a situation in which in

1730
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:43,719
your control volume there is a um a lot

1731
01:35:41,239 --> 01:35:47,920
of entropy

1732
01:35:43,719 --> 01:35:50,239
production and you let it go if it is

1733
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:54,440
not already in a steady

1734
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:57,719
state it will change

1735
01:35:54,440 --> 01:36:00,679
evolve towards a less a lesser and

1736
01:35:57,719 --> 01:36:03,639
lesser entropy production situation

1737
01:36:00,679 --> 01:36:06,840
until it gets to

1738
01:36:03,639 --> 01:36:09,719
zero and the zero will be either a

1739
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:14,040
steady state if it is sustained by the

1740
01:36:09,719 --> 01:36:14,040
boundary conditions or the equilibrium

1741
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:20,520
State instead of doing the details here

1742
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:22,000
that are not really essential for us let

1743
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:25,199
me give you this

1744
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,480
example consider one dimensional heat

1745
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:29,840
transfer

1746
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:33,119
problem and that suppose that you have a

1747
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:37,000
a Time equal equal zero you have

1748
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:37,000
imposed this temperature

1749
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:43,560
profile and your boundary conditions are

1750
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:46,440
that the temperature here is is given

1751
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:48,520
fixed so you you fix the temperatures

1752
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:51,000
left and

1753
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:53,880
right of course that is not a steady

1754
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:57,320
state the system will evolve you can

1755
01:36:53,880 --> 01:37:01,000
solve this with any uh with the for year

1756
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:04,520
equation or any software that does this

1757
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:06,679
solution and you you see it will evolve

1758
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:12,000
and will at the end it will reach the

1759
01:37:06,679 --> 01:37:14,800
steady linear uh solution of the typical

1760
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,960
heat transfer problem now if you compute

1761
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:23,760
the entropy production rate

1762
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:23,760
here it's it's this much

1763
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:30,159
if you compute it here it's this much

1764
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,159
it's a

1765
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:35,080
half so the system as it moves from here

1766
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:39,639
to

1767
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:42,159
there has goes has an an overall Global

1768
01:37:39,639 --> 01:37:45,480
entropy production that goes down in

1769
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:48,400
time until it reaches a minimum uh at

1770
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:49,840
steady state if you start this is

1771
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,360
another example in which you have a

1772
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:54,360
different boundary conditions that would

1773
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:56,360
allow an equilibrium state so you start

1774
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:59,159
from this one and you have an entropy

1775
01:37:56,360 --> 01:38:02,440
production right which is given by this

1776
01:37:59,159 --> 01:38:04,760
you let it go it will reach a flat

1777
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:08,360
temperature profile which is equilibrium

1778
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:08,360
zero entropy production again a

1779
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:14,719
minimum so

1780
01:38:11,639 --> 01:38:16,800
globally it has gone

1781
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:21,040
down but

1782
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:21,920
locally at every instant at every local

1783
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:26,480
uh

1784
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:28,840
each material element here has followed

1785
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:32,159
for Law and

1786
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:35,400
therefore at any time chosen the

1787
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:37,719
direction of a flow that is compatible

1788
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:42,159
with that the

1789
01:38:37,719 --> 01:38:44,520
gradient imposed all right so we're just

1790
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:48,520
on time and just

1791
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:48,520
uh finished
