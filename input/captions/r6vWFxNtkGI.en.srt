1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,400
I'd like to introduce Marvel Velasco,

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,320
co-founder of

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,400
Neta. Mar, take it away. Thank you so

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,160
much for the intro. Hi everyone. Um, a

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,920
pleasure to be here. So, we're going to

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,359
start sharing our screen and go through

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,119
the presentation open for questions

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,920
after. So, yes, my name is Marvel Lasco.

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:30,160
I'm the co-founder of Neta, the product

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,040
packaging intelligence platform.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,040
Before MIT, I worked at the CFO's office

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,600
at Groupup Bimbo where multi-million

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,280
dollar packaging decisions impacted

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,480
directly the bottom line. And Grace, my

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,640
co-founder, was um was a CPG manager at

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,320
the McKenzie. Um so she worked with a

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,280
lot of these Fortune 500 companies

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,280
before she did her MBA and MPP from

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,280
Harvard.

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,680
Packaging is everywhere and it's not

21
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,960
only what you unwrap, but it's a very

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,280
important part of the product. In fact,

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,600
it accounts for up to 10% of its total

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,920
cost. That's why we created Neta, a

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,320
product um that's why we created Neta,

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,360
an AI powered platform that helps

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,200
companies navigate packaging regulations

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,759
and make informed decisions to purchase

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,119
the best packaging design. We'll be

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,000
talking more about the tech more in

31
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,000
depth later on. So, why does this even

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,560
matter? Let's take your local Chipotle

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,920
store for example, which happens to be

34
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,000
our third first paid pilot customer.

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,720
When you go into the store, you'll see

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,119
burrito bowls, foil wraps, drinking

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,240
cups. You'll see even more behind the

38
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,680
counter and before the store. One

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,280
typical Chipotle store has over 100

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,799
unique packaging items. And packaging

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,159
isn't just about the branding and the

42
00:01:53,799 --> 00:02:00,399
functionality. It's about cost and

43
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:03,520
compliance. Regulations around packaging

44
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,399
have existed for decades covering

45
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,360
safety, chemicals, labeling,

46
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,040
environmental standards and tariffs.

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,000
These regulations are fragmented and

48
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:19,360
complex and Anna Aipo has to manage them

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,040
across hundreds of cities. This is truly

50
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,599
impossible for her to do by

51
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,080
herself. She's navigating over 400

52
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,560
unique regulations, mapping Chipotle's

53
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,360
packaging specs to legal definitions and

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,360
possible exemptions, estimating cost and

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,560
looping and sourcing or packaging

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,640
engineers to redesign

57
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:45,519
SKUs. Non-compliance can cost up to $1

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,160
million per month per state. So, that's

59
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,560
where we come in. Not only do we help

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,400
you navigate regulations, but once we

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,400
help you understand them, we guide you

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,560
to the latest packaging materials and

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,560
we'll help you procure them efficiently.

64
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,599
By making smarter decisions, companies

65
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,080
can cut costs up to

66
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:07,280
25%. This is huge. So, let me tell you

67
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,680
how this works. Our platform connects to

68
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,319
our client spec systems. We scan their

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,840
full SKU portfolio to analyze packaging

70
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,080
weights, materials, and sales data. We

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,760
leverage large language models to track

72
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,959
thousands of regulations across various

73
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,680
jurisdictions. These models process

74
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,480
complex regulatory text and map them to

75
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,599
real packaging SKUs, ensuring that

76
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,840
insights are precise, actionable, and

77
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,879
tailored to each customer's unique

78
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,360
packaging footprint. So, as regulations

79
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,080
evolve, our system will continuously

80
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,400
update and provide real time compliance

81
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,400
alerts. This helps companies make

82
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,519
smarter, faster decisions to stay

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,599
compliant and minimize the risks. In

84
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,879
parallel, we use AI to enhance cost

85
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:59,439
optimization, procurement, and packaging

86
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,680
efficiency. We map brands demands data

87
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,599
to suppliers material cataloges,

88
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,480
enabling us to match packaging demand

89
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,560
and supply a lot more effectively. This

90
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,480
approach will help companies build more

91
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,080
resilience and futurep proof supply

92
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,880
chains. And after the webinar, Grace and

93
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,239
I are happy to share a a demo video of

94
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,639
how this really works. So you can look

95
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,360
into our

96
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,919
platform. Now $700 billion is spent on

97
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,600
packaging every single year in this in

98
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,919
the US. Yes, $700 billion. And every

99
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,680
business that sells packaged products

100
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,960
needs better tools to make smarter

101
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,440
decisions. So we bring in companies

102
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,440
through regulations. But the real value

103
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,680
of what build what we're building is

104
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,639
what comes next which is which is

105
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,120
packaging procurement. When a company

106
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,000
needs to comply they also need to

107
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,960
rethink what they're going to buy. So at

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,360
Neta we turn regulatory data into action

109
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,880
helping teams choose smarter materials

110
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,560
lower fee formats and better designs.

111
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,800
We're becoming the platform where

112
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,000
packaging gets optimized and eventually

113
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,240
purchased. And on top of that, we're

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
enabling packaging manufacturers to

115
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,120
produce exactly what buyers like

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,560
Chipotle actually need. So that is how

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,600
we move from a $3 billion regulatory

118
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,880
compliance market into a $30 billion

119
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,800
plus packaging procurement opportunity.

120
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,960
And we are really happy to be here with

121
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,840
all of you today as we have the capacity

122
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,320
to work with two or and to three more

123
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,639
companies for our pilots. This is an

124
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,240
opportunity for you to be part of the

125
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,080
design of the product tailoring it to

126
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,120
your needs before we roll this out in

127
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,039
the standardizes platform. So if any of

128
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,880
anything of what we've just presented

129
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,039
resonates to you or you think it would

130
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,800
resonate to someone in your company,

131
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,639
please reach out to us as we are ready

132
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,039
to scale and support companies save

133
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,800
millions on packaging related costs. I'm

134
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,039
Marvel Velasco and this is Neta. Thank

135
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,600
you so much and open for Q&A.

136
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,160
Great Mark. Thank you so much. And also

137
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,720
I'm welcoming uh Grace for the Q&A, a

138
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,479
co-founder as well with Neta. So as

139
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,280
people um pose their questions to the

140
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:17,759
Q&A at the bottom of your screen um I

141
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,280
will get started. So considering all the

142
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,800
geopolitical changes that are happening

143
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,520
nowadays, what would you say is the main

144
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,280
thing that Neta can bring to the table?

145
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,319
Great question. Thank you so much for

146
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,240
that. um what we bring not only for

147
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,560
companies to stay on top of the

148
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,199
regulations what is more important is

149
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,440
the cost analysis to inform companies

150
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,000
what is the most important decisions or

151
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,400
the reactions to these regulations so we

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,160
help them companies with these analysis

153
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,000
which right now there's very little

154
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
visibility on so with better

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,639
understanding of cost and where the the

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,880
the money is going to go to this helps

157
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,360
company make decisions around where to

158
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,599
com where to procure their products

159
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,520
format changes as required and

160
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,840
visibility on what's the fees or

161
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,680
penalties or any additional costs that

162
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,800
will incur as a result of new

163
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,800
regulations that are coming in.

164
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,759
Thank you, Grace. Um, and a question

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,039
that I was actually it's it's connected

166
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,720
to um the next one. Do you well tell us

167
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,680
a little more about the business model

168
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,840
and also what it would it mean to work

169
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,720
um with you for a pilot for a corporate

170
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,840
but also in the US outside of the US.

171
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,599
Tell us about that. Yeah definitely. So

172
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,520
we are right now working with any

173
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,360
company that sells packaged products

174
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,280
into the US. So you can be an

175
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,599
international company but if you sell

176
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,680
your products in the US we are covering

177
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,599
the US regulatory landscape as of for

178
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,360
now as our go-to market. So definitely

179
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,039
we can support you. The way we're

180
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,199
working with our pilots is we are

181
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,919
designing the pilots in three months. So

182
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,840
we design the scope of work with the

183
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,960
company that we are going to on board as

184
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,199
a pilot and we define what regulations

185
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,360
and states. So geographical coverage

186
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,599
within the US is most important to the

187
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,440
company. We demonstrate how we add value

188
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,680
giving full visibility to the company on

189
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,680
what these regulations actually actually

190
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,759
represent for them and how much it's

191
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,080
costing it because procurement normally

192
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,240
just looks for the cheapest packaging

193
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,199
but doesn't aggregate all the taxes that

194
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,879
come on top of that. There's a lot of um

195
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,919
new legislations for example extended

196
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,400
producer responsibility EPR that is now

197
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,039
incentivizing companies to change to

198
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,280
more recyclable compostable packaging so

199
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,440
more sustainability. um what they're

200
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,080
doing is taxing a lot more higher fees

201
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,320
to the materials that are not as

202
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,159
recyclable as others could be. And so

203
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,719
what we will do is bring that cost

204
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,640
analysis to the company so they can then

205
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,240
look go back to the procurement and see

206
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,200
if there's they need to make any

207
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,200
changes. Um our business model is right

208
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,120
now we'll define um um fixed fee on what

209
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,560
that pilot would look like depending on

210
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,240
the scope of the work but then

211
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,120
transition into a SAS subscription

212
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,080
model. Great. Thank you very much to

213
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,080
both
