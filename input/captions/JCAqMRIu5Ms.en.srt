1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,080
And it is now my pleasure to introduce

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,360
the next speaker who will be talking

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,559
about XR in manufacturing building the

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,839
factories of tomorrow. So XR is

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,199
reshaping manufacturing by

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,920
revolutionizing how we design produce

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,039
and maintain. The upcoming keynote will

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,439
explore promising XR applications, their

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,240
role in creating efficient, sustainable

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,880
manufacturing systems and the road map

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,440
for overcoming barriers to unlock their

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,840
full potential. So ladies and gentlemen,

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,120
please join me in welcoming the postto

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,520
scientist at Technicia Universate Vin

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,300
which is the Vienna University of

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:01:00,029
Technology, Sara Sheffa.

17
00:00:44,300 --> 00:01:00,029
[Music]

18
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,400
[Applause]

19
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,080
So, thank you very much all for coming.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,640
I feel very honored to be here today.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,799
Um, and I hope I represent Austria in a

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,600
proper way because I am Dutch. So, let's

23
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,200
see if I can do it in a proper way. Um,

24
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
so today I will be talking about

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,960
extended reality and manufacturing. I

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,960
always say um sometimes I feel like I

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,840
live in Sara's reality. It's a bit the

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,840
domain in which I work. So, it's uh

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,400
yeah, I will discuss later what extended

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,400
reality means. Um, and let's let's get

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,400
started.

32
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,640
Hey. So let's augment the future

33
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:18,000
together. Um a short introduction about

34
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,160
myself. As you probably know from my

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,520
accent, I am Dutch. My name is Saraser.

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm a postto at Tuin. Um I have an

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,879
expertise in extended reality

38
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,800
troubleshooting, predictive maintenance

39
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,520
in in the domains of manufacturing,

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,280
production, logistics, and management.

41
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,959
And a fun fact is that I'm third

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,959
generation of ship builders. So my

43
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,720
father and my grandfathers were all ship

44
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,480
building. In the ship building, I mean

45
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,000
we are Dutch. All we have is water. So

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,480
what else can I become? And um so when I

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
was uh I told my father I would like to

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,000
become an engineer. And then he said

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,760
Sara before you enter that office of

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,160
becoming an engineer you have to go to

51
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,000
the to the workshop and you have to work

52
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,959
with your hands with the with the boys

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,120
and and girls who who work in the shop

54
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,800
floor because you don't have any

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,959
experience. You need to weld. You need

56
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,000
to get your hands dirty and you need to

57
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,640
get working. So I said okay let's try.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,560
So um I went for almost a year at the

59
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,879
shipyard and I was working in my one

60
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,319
year my overall walking with the mis

61
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,840
like a welding equipment and why am I

62
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,640
telling this because it's very important

63
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,280
to get get to know the workers that you

64
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,840
work with um to identify yourself with

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,560
them and if you have new technologies

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,360
such as extended reality you need to

67
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,920
incorporate it in such a way that they

68
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,080
can relate to it. So you cannot just

69
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,000
come up with the technology, bring for

70
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,040
example the holo lens to the technicians

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,560
and say here's the technology solution

72
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,360
let's get to work. You really need to

73
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,840
embed such a solution into the

74
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,920
workforce. So therefore the human in the

75
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,440
loop operation but also the human

76
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,640
machine interaction is very important um

77
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,519
to consider. So apart from the naval

78
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,439
architecture, I also because I thought

79
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,280
naval

80
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:08,400
archite architecture is very specific.

81
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,519
Um maybe I should extend my my field. So

82
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,239
I then worked in aviation and um then I

83
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,560
went to the railway sector and then I I

84
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,079
basically almost covered all the

85
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,320
logistics uh field. Um then I also

86
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,880
worked for a project with semiconductor

87
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,520
industry. So I think I covered some some

88
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,440
application

89
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,520
areas. I cannot work all by myself of

90
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,160
course. Um I have a very good team

91
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,759
behind me and the research unit that I

92
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,560
work in is the production maintenance

93
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:42,720
management team of um professor Vasil

94
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,600
Anzari. So he is leading our team on

95
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,880
datadriven production and maintenance

96
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,680
management. And we are a group that's

97
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,720
really data driven. So we have a lot of

98
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:56,400
projects about AI, AR um and then we

99
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,800
incorporate also the sustainability

100
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,479
asset aspect in this um environment. And

101
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,560
another thing that's very interesting is

102
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,520
that we have a pilot factory and a pilot

103
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,199
factory is basically um a condensed

104
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,479
setting of a real world industrial

105
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,960
scenario. So what we can do is we can

106
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:18,199
mimic um yeah scenario in a logistic or

107
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,880
in a

108
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,360
production field and then have it in in

109
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,039
our own consent setting. So we have a

110
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,039
bit more control. So there we can

111
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,880
conduct um experiments for

112
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,400
example and then um because I feel like

113
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,479
I always have two fathers. One of them

114
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,320
is C, one of them is is Fasil. So the

115
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,280
other professor that I collaborate with

116
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,240
is um professor Gord Matias and together

117
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,320
we are building up a new research group

118
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,880
and this is a technology enhanced

119
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,120
logistic and maintenance management

120
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,639
group and of course here we also

121
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,639
incorporate a lot of human in the loop

122
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,160
oper operations the supply chain

123
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,320
management. So not only do we look at

124
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,039
into one specific asset but into the

125
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,800
entire supply chain and another thing

126
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,720
that is very important for us is

127
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,560
education and teaching. So we cannot

128
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,639
uh so we are responsible for teaching

129
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,720
our future engineers and maybe

130
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,360
technicians our future the workforce and

131
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,120
therefore it's also very important to

132
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:22,800
incorporate them into our vision.

133
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,960
When we go to the state-of-the-art of

134
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:30,039
manufacturing, we see that in recent

135
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:32,800
years a lot of um data

136
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,560
um came up with the manufacturer,

137
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,960
maintenance and project production and

138
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,600
logistics systems. So we see that coming

139
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,680
from all these assets a lot of big uh

140
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,840
yeah a lot of information is coming and

141
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,440
this information we need to perform

142
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,000
maintenance for example on the rolling

143
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,840
stock and what we see in this area is

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,240
that a lot of information technology and

145
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,919
operational technology intertwine and

146
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,120
then it becomes difficult to solve

147
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,599
issues in when you have system failures

148
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,360
in for example a train

149
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,880
um not only in trains but also in the

150
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,919
other transport uh sectors. So therefore

151
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,840
we need to get an understanding of what

152
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,520
does this data mean that that that

153
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,440
exists because we have to deal with

154
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,440
real-time monitoring data but also with

155
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,360
historical data and all different kind

156
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,160
of data. So how can we structure this

157
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,960
information in such a way that we know

158
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,080
what has failed or how we can support

159
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,360
for example technicians.

160
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,800
So if we go and for a deep dive into the

161
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,199
state of manufacturing and the problems

162
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,080
that occur then we see for example that

163
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,840
there is the IT and OT convergence. So

164
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,000
the information technology and the

165
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,080
operational technology systems from for

166
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,880
example a rolling stock or an aircraft

167
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,120
whatever um they come intertwined and

168
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,280
when a failure in that system occurs

169
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,560
then it becomes very difficult to

170
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,440
understand what has failed and how you

171
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,120
can resolve this system failure. um

172
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,919
there at the same time there's also a

173
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,360
lot of fragmented data and it mean it

174
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,080
means that there's a lot of data and

175
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,400
different data sources. So for example

176
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,560
if I'm a technician and I have to

177
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,360
troubleshoot something then I have to

178
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,319
use different information sources to

179
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,479
access and then to identify what is the

180
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,080
problem. So therefore my decision-

181
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,240
making not only for the managers but

182
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,479
also for the the the work floor and for

183
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,080
the operators becomes more difficult

184
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,919
because they yeah really need support in

185
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,680
this and the operator requirements

186
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,279
basically means is how can we support

187
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,519
the operators so the future technicians

188
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,760
in resolving this uh yeah issues and

189
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,320
another thing is that we face is the the

190
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,800
loss of not only tested but knowledge in

191
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,360
general. So for example, a lot of people

192
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,360
they they get older or some people they

193
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,440
stay only for a few years in a in a

194
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,480
certain job and then they leave the

195
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,720
company and then the knowledge is lost.

196
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,120
So how can we deal with these kind of

197
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,760
issues and at the same time we also have

198
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,080
to um be mindful about the

199
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,760
sustainability pressures. So we have to

200
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,880
support sustainable operations,

201
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,320
sustainable manufacturing systems. Um so

202
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,040
these are also things that we have to

203
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,920
keep in mind.

204
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,920
If we um look into extended reality, I I

205
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,519
didn't know how many people know about

206
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,120
the concept of extended reality, but

207
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:26,160
extended reality is basically um all the

208
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,399
different realities in the continuum. So

209
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,600
it goes from augmented reality to

210
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,080
virtual reality in in which augmented

211
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,880
reality you have an overlay on the real

212
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,680
environment in like two or 3D. Mixed

213
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,519
reality is a combination with AR, VR and

214
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,560
virtual reality. then you are completely

215
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:48,160
immersed into the virtual reality and in

216
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,480
the next video um I will focus I will

217
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,760
give an example of virtual reality I

218
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,240
collaborated a lot with the Dutch

219
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,440
railway companies Dutch railway company

220
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,360
it's only one and um here we have two

221
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,240
different scenarios so the first one is

222
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,920
about uh the system failure of a door

223
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,519
because in the rolling stock we see a

224
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,480
lot of system failures in the door

225
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,560
system so that basically the mechanism

226
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,959
of the door doesn't close properly

227
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,760
And here we made a simulation to train

228
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,320
the technicians on how to uh step by

229
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,680
step resolve the issue. And the other

230
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,000
one is about um the conductors because

231
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,519
conductors have to deal with a lot of

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,680
different people when they work on the

233
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,519
platform. So some of them are disabled

234
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,880
so they need some support. Sometimes

235
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,160
people are aggressive so you need to

236
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:40,279
deal with them as well. Um so those are

237
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,279
the two um examples that we will see.

238
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,320
Yeah, that is

239
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,160
so uh

240
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,480
nasty. Yeah, fine.

241
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Okay.

242
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,959
So, the subtitles of the the last part

243
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,600
kind of disappeared, but it was a way of

244
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,880
are you okay? And then the woman could

245
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,120
roll into the into the train. Um, and

246
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,959
the second uh video that I would like to

247
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,920
introduce augmented reality is also in

248
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,640
the context of the railways. Um and here

249
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,000
we conducted different yeah research

250
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,079
already and we given a short overview of

251
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,519
the IT and OT convergence and then we

252
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,000
move towards the troubleshooting. So

253
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,240
troubleshooting is basically a way to

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,399
automatically detect failures of a train

255
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,399
and how to step by step solve that

256
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,440
issue. The railway industry experienced

257
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,800
a digital transformation in recent years

258
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:05,040
the impact of which is complex. Also,

259
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,279
traditional operation technology systems

260
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,320
become more and more connected and

261
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,720
intertwined with information technology

262
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,480
systems. This is called

263
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,440
convergence. Digitization and

264
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,200
convergence of IT and OT systems becomes

265
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,200
increasingly important for railway

266
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,720
operations to achieve less maintenance

267
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,680
cost, efficient and reliable operations.

268
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,160
However, the convergence of IT and OT

269
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,560
requires new maintenance strategies and

270
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,839
thus paves the way towards the use of

271
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,320
new technologies such as augmented

272
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:42,079
reality. We examine the use of AR as a

273
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,519
tool for IT and OT failure analysis. AR

274
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,079
can support the operator by

275
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,079
troubleshooting IT and OT failures and

276
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,680
give step-by-step guidance to resolve

277
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:54,880
the issue. We already explored future AR

278
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,320
applications in NS which are automatic

279
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,720
fault detection, translation of work

280
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,200
descriptions, inspection of complex

281
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,320
components, having access to remote

282
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:07,040
assistance and assistance for

283
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,040
specialized work. Operators work in a

284
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,360
dynamic working environment requiring

285
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,600
both high adaptive capabilities and

286
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,839
expert knowledge. We proposed an

287
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,839
adaptive architectural framework aimed

288
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,839
at shaping and structuring the process

289
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,360
that provides operators with tailored

290
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:26,000
support when using an AR tool. Ongoing

291
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,320
research focuses on combining artificial

292
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,600
intelligence and AR to create a

293
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,360
troubleshooting tool for IToT converge

294
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,120
systems. So this um is about the

295
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,839
operator 4.0. I think it has some

296
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,839
alignment with with John's presentation.

297
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,519
Um so the operator 4.0 0 who is the

298
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,760
operator 4.0 So it's the future

299
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,680
technician. So it's a person who works

300
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,040
with new technologies such as augmented

301
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,560
reality, virtual reality, all these kind

302
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,680
of um end tools. Um and this person has

303
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,440
to work with yeah these new has to find

304
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,920
new ways to work with the technology.

305
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,600
The technology has to be embedded within

306
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:08,000
his working method. And um this is Tai

307
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,480
and Ta was performing some experiments

308
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,279
on the train and Tai has different

309
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,399
expertise. So TA has diff. So if I

310
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,639
compare my own expertise with TIC then I

311
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,040
can say that I am less experienced. So

312
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,040
for example Tai would need less support

313
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,959
than I would need. And at the same time

314
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,279
his ergonomics are also different. Um

315
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,440
and also his interest. So for example

316
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,040
Tai could be color blind and therefore

317
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,120
he needs different support than for

318
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,959
example I would have and at the same

319
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,480
time he has more knowledge than I and

320
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,680
how can we capture that knowledge that

321
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,000
is in his mind. Um at the same time we

322
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,519
have different maintenance operations.

323
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,600
So they are more dynamic. There are

324
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,600
different task requirements, different

325
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,920
planning and methods needed, different

326
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,760
ways of performing the maintenance. And

327
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,160
we have on the other hand also the

328
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,760
technology itself. So we have hardware

329
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,279
and software constraints. Um cont the

330
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,279
system needs to contextualize and

331
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,279
customize the information. So

332
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:07,440
basically um one of the constraints

333
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,639
could be that if it's summer it's very

334
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,040
warm to wear such a such a device and

335
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,079
therefore there is a need to have a

336
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,880
dynamic tool that is tailored to dice

337
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,839
and also to me. So you need to have yeah

338
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,639
a dynamic tool that changes its

339
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,240
information

340
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,320
supply. And if we look into the data

341
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,720
collection and data platforms, we see

342
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,519
that as we discussed before, there's a

343
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,800
lot of data segment fragmentation. So a

344
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,320
lot of different information is stored

345
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,399
in different places. So the real-time

346
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,079
monitoring information is here. Um the

347
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,880
operational data is stored in a

348
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,959
different place and the work

349
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,839
instructions are located somewhere else

350
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,000
and how can you then perform decision

351
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,320
making, make the right decisions in the

352
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,320
troubleshooting procedure. So what we

353
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,880
did here is we collaborated with the

354
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,880
Tokyo Institute of Technology as well

355
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,720
and

356
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,519
um there they were more focused and

357
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,920
specialized in in database research. So

358
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,839
we created the database and we filtered

359
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,000
all the information coming from the

360
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,759
railway company. We could filter all the

361
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,759
relevant information that was useful and

362
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,320
we could filter the information that is

363
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,399
useful for the technician. Um and what

364
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,360
we incorporated here is for example

365
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,440
machine learning and um natural language

366
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,160
processing to detect what kind of

367
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,040
information was stored in the system. So

368
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,600
for example we saw that operators would

369
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,240
fill in that the toilet because we had

370
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,160
to focus on the sanitary system then the

371
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,800
operator would mention the toilet looks

372
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,720
like a Coca-Cola can and a Coca-Cola can

373
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,560
I mean we don't know what it means but

374
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,720
yeah in their minds a Coca-Cola can

375
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,560
means that the toilet was clogged. So

376
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,079
all these kind of things makes it more

377
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,079
difficult to use natural language

378
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:55,839
processing. And in the video we um

379
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,560
applied the decision- making supports.

380
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,519
What we did is we collected some systems

381
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,759
of the sanitary system and from all the

382
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,240
systems in the train the sanitary system

383
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,439
has very high priority because if there

384
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:13,120
are no um toilets functioning properly

385
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,199
in the train you cannot um operate the

386
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,240
train for passengers because we all need

387
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,400
to use the bathroom if you need. So what

388
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,160
we did here is we collected the systems,

389
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,160
we um combined it with object

390
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,360
recognition so you can really see what

391
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,160
kind of button you have to press um and

392
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,520
you could uh then see what for what kind

393
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,840
of step-by-step information you need to

394
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,480
solve the issue. So this is a very

395
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,600
condensed laboratory setting and this

396
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,280
system could also um save and store the

397
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,600
information that you put. So for

398
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,080
example, if today I clean the the

399
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,240
sensors of the toilet, then it remembers

400
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,960
and then it predicts when I have to

401
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,960
clean the sensors

402
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,120
again. Other research is focusing on

403
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,240
combining AI and AR. At the moment we

404
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,320
have a project going on with Carion. Um

405
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,360
and here we want to reduce the human

406
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,200
error by implementing

407
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,799
um AI powered aircraft inspections

408
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,760
um to enhance safety and improve

409
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,840
maintenance accuracy. So this project is

410
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,480
u at the moment conducted by a PhD

411
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,080
student in our research group. Um and

412
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,799
then we also have a topic about the

413
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,480
knowledge management. Uh here we

414
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,520
conducted research with the Dutch

415
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,440
defense and then we had an a product. I

416
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,120
cannot mention or specify what specific

417
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,679
product. Um and then the the military

418
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,400
military guy had to disassemble and

419
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,520
assemble

420
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,520
um the the product together. Um and that

421
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,760
was a very nice way in how we could

422
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,440
capture his knowledge because um at some

423
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,760
point he was deviating from the

424
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,880
maintenance manual and in that way you

425
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,520
can kind of capture a little bit of the

426
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,039
the knowledge and then you can um save

427
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,280
that information and then put it back

428
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:05,720
into the system for in this specific

429
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,840
case it was in the

430
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,919
AR. Um then we go to the

431
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,520
troubleshooting. Troubleshooting is a

432
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,080
way to automatically generate the

433
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,320
failure mechanism of a system and this

434
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,080
is also a way of understanding complex

435
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:23,440
problem problems and supporting operator

436
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:25,520
4.0. Um in this example we were um

437
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,919
putting in a standardized procedure for

438
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,600
the door system failure. As I mentioned

439
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,799
before the the door system failure is

440
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,600
also a reoccurring problem. Um what we

441
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,760
see here is that troubleshooting is most

442
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,559
useful if you use it in cases in which

443
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:47,039
it is highly complex and also um not

444
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:49,360
commonly used. So if you put such um um

445
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,120
problem into the AR system and a

446
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,320
technician knows how to resolve it then

447
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,799
the next time he it becomes easier to uh

448
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,760
resolve the issue. So you really need to

449
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,080
incorporate the more complex uh problems

450
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,160
because once it's standardized then

451
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,080
people know how to solve certain

452
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:11,520
issues. Then we had another um example

453
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,000
of combining AI and AR. Um we had a

454
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,720
collaboration with Albelli and Albelli

455
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,799
they print the photo books um to store

456
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,880
all of our beautiful memories. And um

457
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,799
what we noticed here is that Albellyi

458
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,120
when they so this is the printing

459
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,960
machine to print the photo books and

460
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,159
when Alelli was printing the books then

461
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,679
sometimes the the cover of the book had

462
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,159
a round shape of or it was um tilted. So

463
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,280
you need to have a straight book spine

464
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:43,520
and based on the shape of the book spine

465
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,000
you you would know where to solve the

466
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,880
system failure in the machine itself. So

467
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,120
here we combined AR knowledgebased

468
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,120
systems and artificial intelligence. So

469
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,840
you could really detect with the holo

470
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,679
lens uh the object and then the

471
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,320
step-by-step instructions would follow

472
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,679
related to the machine on how to solve

473
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,840
uh the system failure.

474
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,000
The

475
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,020
last more

476
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,600
technical

477
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:13,600
[Music]

478
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,600
part.

479
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,320
No, wait.

480
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:39,240
So the last um part um is about the

481
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,240
functionality.

482
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,400
Um so what we have here in this video

483
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,799
below is we um had a real

484
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,480
troubleshooting scenario of the train.

485
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,880
So first we had a condensed setting in a

486
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,640
laboratory setting in which we were

487
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,280
troubleshooting but then the technicians

488
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,280
they gave us the feedback. They said

489
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,280
tada cut the crap we need to have the

490
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,919
real the real deal. we don't want to

491
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,080
perform experiments in a in a lab uh

492
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,880
setting. We want to solve it in a real

493
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,679
case scenario. So then we transformed

494
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,039
from the lab to the real train. And what

495
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,960
they could do was really nice because

496
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,840
they could put the system error exactly

497
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:20,799
as we tested in the lab but then in real

498
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:23,440
case um we had um we used the point

499
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,159
clouds to create the 3D image and then

500
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,679
you can have the object recognition. And

501
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,559
at some point it was quite funny because

502
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,880
one of the technicians he said um s do I

503
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,960
really have to pull these plugs and I

504
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,600
said yeah I think so but I don't know I

505
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,480
mean we never did maintenance on a real

506
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,799
train but in the end they were able to

507
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,440
to solve the issues. I think that was

508
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,960
quite nice experiment. Uh and at the

509
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,480
same time we have the multi- aent

510
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,240
collaboration.

511
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,360
So the multi- aent collaboration means

512
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:56,559
that if I collaborate with someone on

513
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,240
the same asset let's say a car um then I

514
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,120
can see what my colleague is seeing and

515
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,120
I can help him or her in certain ways.

516
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,559
So um here you can see the different

517
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,039
views um and also I think the ergonomics

518
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,400
here are captured. What is important

519
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:15,120
here is to have the data collection anal

520
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,039
analysis in a proper way. So you need to

521
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,039
have your real-time monitoring data in

522
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,919
order and the the fragmented data in one

523
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,799
centralized place and you need to push

524
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:27,360
the right information to the technician

525
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:30,919
that is relevant for him or her to solve

526
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,919
the system failure.

527
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,259
[Music]

528
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:48,240
[Music]

529
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,000
So going uh forward to the next topic uh

530
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,320
we also look into the organizational

531
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,320
impact as I mentioned before we cannot

532
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,320
just go with the technology put it

533
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,720
somewhere and then make sure that

534
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:04,480
organization can manage themselves. Um

535
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,159
one more specific technical um detail is

536
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,240
that the user interface design needs to

537
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,720
be in such a way that everyone can

538
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,760
comprehend the information intuitively.

539
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,320
So for example I would need different

540
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,320
user interface than than my colleague.

541
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,880
Um so you need to design it in such a

542
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,080
way that I can perceive it properly so

543
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,320
it becomes easy

544
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:29,440
understandable and at the same time um

545
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,880
it's also important uh to develop an

546
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,840
extended reality road map for

547
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,640
organizations. So what we did um with

548
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,240
another company is we created uh we

549
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,120
could compute the maturity level

550
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,679
readiness of this specific technology

551
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,679
for the organization and what we saw is

552
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,480
that it is really necessary for for

553
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,880
organizations to develop a road map have

554
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,039
dedicated extended reality teams with

555
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,120
centralized documentation. So your data

556
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,520
infrastructure need to be in order in

557
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,400
order to use such a technology. You need

558
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,880
to make sure that someone has ownership.

559
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,799
So has the leadership within a project.

560
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,480
The data accessibility is of course

561
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,039
important because if you don't have

562
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,760
access to the data then it becomes very

563
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:15,279
difficult to proceed.

564
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,960
Um and then uh another important part is

565
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,200
besides a case study you should

566
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,880
incorporate a pilot program and a pilot

567
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,039
program is kind of um maybe a year or

568
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,440
something to incorporate the technology

569
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,200
and see how you can improve. So this is

570
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,760
also something that we have been working

571
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,679
on with the Dutch

572
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,600
railways and um the funny thing is that

573
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,279
the other day I was invited by Austrian

574
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,960
company and then they asked me s you

575
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,360
have very interesting technology and

576
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,400
knowledge. Can you also give us some

577
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,559
direction? So I came up with my um with

578
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,880
the presentation and my vision on how

579
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,400
they could incorporate the technology as

580
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,880
well.

581
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,880
And then one of the guys said, "Yeah, I

582
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,679
think paperbased manuals are just better

583
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,440
than this." And then I thought, "Okay, I

584
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:06,799
think I wasted an hour here." But okay,

585
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:10,559
I think it's important for people to uh

586
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:14,000
step on this um track of digitization

587
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,159
and implementation of new technologies

588
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,720
um not only for organizations but also

589
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,960
for teaching. So what we did at TUV so

590
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,880
far is we did incorporate and have some

591
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,799
projects running for extended reality in

592
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,279
teaching for

593
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:30,400
example and um one of the examples that

594
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,840
I had is I had a company an aviation

595
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,000
company and they came to me and they

596
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,080
said we would like to have helicopter

597
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,360
blade inspections and we would like to

598
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,760
incorporate thermal

599
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,600
um heat detection so heat mapping and

600
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,240
that you could really see as an

601
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:52,320
inspector how to um incorporate or how

602
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,360
to see or control the the quality of the

603
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,600
helicopter blade. And as a researcher,

604
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,919
sometimes we're also a bit lazy. So I

605
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,559
went to my students that I teach a

606
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,120
course for and I told my students,

607
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,240
"Guys, this is a case study from a

608
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,080
company. Can you solve this?" Um and

609
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,480
they were able to solve the case and

610
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,400
then they indirectly helped the company

611
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:19,360
also um contributing So what I think is

612
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,200
very nice is that not only do we support

613
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,360
companies, we can also implement case

614
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,880
studies for students, the future

615
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,200
engineers to learn how to incorporate

616
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,360
these new technologies and how to work

617
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,760
with organizations. So then they are

618
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:38,200
really embedded um in the teaching as

619
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:42,039
well and therefore

620
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:45,520
um we created a road map for

621
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:47,440
uh the teaching as well. So uh first

622
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,640
it's very important to identify what

623
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,960
kind of cont content you can give for

624
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,919
lectures um what kind of domains are

625
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,760
relevant and then you specify the

626
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,640
specific technology you want to work

627
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,840
with. Um at the same time you also need

628
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,840
to have 3D models the scenes the

629
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,360
scenarios that you want to teach. You

630
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,919
need to train your your teachers um and

631
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,520
staff on using these technologies. You

632
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,960
need some to have some support some

633
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,840
motivation of students and then in the

634
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,480
end you need to have some kind of an

635
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:27,039
environment to support um yeah the

636
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:30,000
creation of such a study program.

637
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,480
um not only do we focus on the students

638
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
but also for organizations. So if you

639
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,960
are an organization and you want to

640
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,440
start with AR of new extended reality

641
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,159
technologies then it's very important to

642
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,039
have a plan of approach um and of course

643
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,600
a goal um that you want to achieve

644
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,360
within a few years and at the same time

645
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,600
it's also very important to create a

646
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,399
community of practice to have dedicated

647
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,360
AR teams and to also have a backlog so a

648
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,919
centralized data platform.

649
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,080
Um, of course you cannot just wing it.

650
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,440
You need to comply to rules and

651
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,240
regulations um from the AU EU but also

652
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,320
from your yeah local government and then

653
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,880
you can create a solution outline in

654
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,039
which you evaluate whether or not the

655
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,159
project is um

656
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:22,520
sustainable. This is also a road map

657
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:26,080
that we developed. So what we saw in the

658
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:29,279
um back in the in time that um they

659
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,880
started with remote support uh trials

660
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,520
and remote support basically means that

661
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,520
if I work here and I collaborate with my

662
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,919
colleague in the Netherlands then I can

663
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,679
look and support him from a distance.

664
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,440
The documented assistant is the next

665
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,840
step in which you put all the documents

666
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,760
like the work description in one folder

667
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,760
and give step-by-step um directions. the

668
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,520
sequence assistance. Then you you add

669
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,360
the 3D models, you add the object

670
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,320
recognition. So it already becomes a bit

671
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,679
more smart and intelligent and um the

672
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,360
next step would be intelligence

673
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,799
assistance in which you combine

674
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,760
augmented reality and artificial

675
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:07,120
intelligence and who knows maybe in the

676
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:10,320
end we will end up with robots.

677
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,960
So I would like to end this uh keynote

678
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,039
with um saying that I think it's very

679
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,640
good that we are all here today and it's

680
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,799
good to connect not only with the

681
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,720
technology but also with each other uh

682
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,120
worldwide because I think it's important

683
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:27,039
that we can all augment the future

684
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,039
together. So thank you very

685
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:38,000
much for a little bit. Yes. May I ask

686
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,240
you to stay with me on stage just a

687
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,399
little bit because I can already see we

688
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,960
received questions and here's the first

689
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:48,240
one. How long do you think it will take

690
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:50,480
for XR to be common place in industries?

691
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,360
How can industry, academia, government

692
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,440
help speed up adoption? I think it's a

693
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,399
very nice uh question. What I do think

694
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,720
is um it's very difficult to say when is

695
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,159
the technology ready to implement. So

696
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,880
what we see for example if you look into

697
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,279
the holo lens if if it's a end tool

698
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,440
already then we can already understand

699
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,279
that technicians cannot work with it

700
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,520
because um the feedback that I received

701
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,640
is for example it's too heavy I get

702
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:19,279
sweaty it's um so or if it's too dark

703
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,399
then I might fall in a manhole and these

704
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:25,360
kind of things um and I do think that if

705
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,080
you incorporate industry academia and

706
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,159
government all together um and start

707
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,240
projects together it will definitely

708
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,880
speed up the the adoption because then

709
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,519
it becomes a more known phenomena and

710
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,080
then people will understand that it's

711
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,000
important to incorporate.

712
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,679
Pick another question. So what are the

713
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,760
biggest barriers to ARMR VR adoption in

714
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,760
manufacturing and how can we increase

715
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,440
adoption rates? Yeah, I think um in I

716
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,919
think some of it was already covered

717
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,440
before. So I think at the moment the the

718
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,480
hardware itself is still a bit

719
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,960
limitating. So um there are some

720
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,919
limitations with sometimes accuracy but

721
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,159
also um with the connection with the

722
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,080
Wi-Fi for example. So that has more

723
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,320
hardware restrictions that it becomes

724
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,120
difficult to to adopt and at the same

725
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,399
time sometimes it's also difficult for

726
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,080
technicians to um accept that they have

727
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,679
to work with new technologies because

728
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,360
sometimes they are a bit worried that

729
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,440
they might be replaced in the end by

730
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,799
robots. So I think it's also important

731
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,279
to emphasize that it is um an addition

732
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,559
to the work and not a way to replace the

733
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:36,360
workforce. All right. So let's maybe

734
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:40,000
have one

735
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:41,519
more question. So could XR be part of a

736
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,919
business model for outsourced

737
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,960
maintenance operated by external

738
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,399
companies or is just cost cutting in

739
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,799
internal operation and maintenance?

740
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:54,799
Um I think at the moment it could be

741
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,320
part of the business model. Um what I

742
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,960
see right now is that a lot of companies

743
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,159
they try to really set up the new teams

744
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,840
and they really want to do the

745
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,320
maintenance themselves. But I can also

746
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,640
understand that it's better sometimes to

747
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:10,159
outsource because um sometimes you don't

748
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,240
have the capabilities to to um code for

749
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,159
example or put all the maintenance

750
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,039
information in it. So then it becomes

751
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,200
better to outsource some kind of things.

752
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,960
All right. Thank you very much. Thanks

753
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,960
for sharing your expertise. Please give

754
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,440
a big round of applause for Sara Sha.

755
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,440
Thank you so much.
