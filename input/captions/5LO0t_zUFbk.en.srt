[Music]

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,480
okay so now let's introduce the

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,040
experimental technology that we're using

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,519
to measure the effects of genetic

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,280
perturbations in single cells in the

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:17,199
last decade or so there's been this

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,640
really amazing technology uh for genetic

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,359
uh engineering and editing called

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,840
crisper cast 9 which you may have heard

10
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,720
about in the news and this is a gene

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,560
editing technology that allows us to

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,480
specifically knock out or reduce the

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,360
expression of a Target Gene

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,559
and how crisper C9 works is we have this

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,280
protein called the cine nucleus and this

16
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,920
is guided to a specific uh sequence in

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,239
your genome based on the sequence of a

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,559
specific single guide RNA and this guide

19
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,280
RNA can guide you to Any Given Gene such

20
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:53,960
as tcf7 or pdcd1 and it brings along the

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,480
cast nucleus and when the cast nucleus

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,079
binds that specific site it leads to a

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,840
double strand break in the genome and

24
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,079
this is a really bad thing for the

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,280
genome in general but it allows us to

26
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,159
actually uh reduce or eliminate the

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,320
expression of a Target Gene and so what

28
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,439
happens when you have this break is that

29
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,799
repair Machinery in our bodies gets

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,960
activated and while trying to repair

31
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,400
this break uh there are mutations that

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,479
are typically made and those mutations

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,240
that are now introduced into the gene

34
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,200
lead to reduction or complete loss of

35
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,119
that Gene's expression so this gives us

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,600
the ability to reduce or knock out the

37
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:34,320
expression of a gene like tcf7 or pdcd1

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,399
in a highly targeted and specific

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,880
way okay so now using the crisper cast 9

40
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,240
Gene editing technology we can take te-

41
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,560
cells and with for each te- cell knock

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,040
out a specific Gene of Interest so for

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,560
instance in this t- cell we might have

44
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,360
knocked out the Gene tcf7 and in this t-

45
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,680
cell we might have knocked out the Gene

46
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,920
pdcd1 and we can do these perturbations

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,600
in parallel and grow up these te- cells

48
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,520
and then now we've genetically added

49
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,759
these te- cells we can introduce them

50
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,920
into cancer and the te- cells will get

51
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,640
activated in the cancer environment and

52
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,080
eventually they'll become exhausted uh

53
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,200
and so after some time we can isolate

54
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,239
the te- cells from the cancer and carry

55
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,560
out the perturb seek experiment and

56
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,840
perturb seek will allow us to read out

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,040
for every individual t- cell both the

58
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,680
perturbation are received here A or B as

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,440
well as the gene expression within that

60
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,400
single cell and we're able to read out

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,400
the perturbation the cell Reed because

62
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,040
the crisper cast 9 uh leaves find a

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,319
specific sequence in the DNA that tells

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,680
us what genetic perturbation that cell

65
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,159
received so the outcome again is the

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,879
expression of every single Gene in the

67
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,959
Single Cell as well as the genetic

68
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,560
perturbation the cell received and we

69
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,080
know that perturbing one gene will have

70
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,560
effect on many other genes in the cell

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,480
so for instance this genetic

72
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,400
perturbation a is associated with the

73
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,200
affector t- cell state which we can read

74
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,519
out by looking at the gene expression

75
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,480
and this perturbation B is associated

76
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,920
with a terminal exhausted cell state

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,680
which again we can read out by looking

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,080
at the transcriptional information in

79
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,040
that single cell so the data that you'll

80
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,879
get will be structured as follows in the

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,799
challenge where you'll receive a gene

82
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,799
expression Matrix that again has the

83
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,080
expression of every single Gene in every

84
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,640
single cell and in addition you'll see

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,760
uh for every single cell what

86
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,799
perturbation that cell Reed so for

87
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,159
instance cell one received the

88
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,439
perturbation tox meaning the tox Gene

89
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,840
was knocked out the tox gene expression

90
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,040
should be reduced in that cell at zero

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,840
and remember you have that information

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,400
as well as the transcriptional

93
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,400
information so the advantages of perturb

94
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,239
seek are many this is a single cell

95
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,799
readout so we can read you know the

96
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,360
effects of perturbations in thousands

97
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,640
and thousands of cells so that's really

98
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,920
incredible we can test many individual

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,040
perturbations in parallel so you see

100
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,680
here you know there's many different

101
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,560
perturbations we're characterizing and

102
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,159
because we have the perturbation and the

103
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,400
resulting gene expression in the same

104
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,519
cell that allows us to think about

105
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,120
causality and inferring Gene regulation

106
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,040
now the disadvantage of Percy is that

107
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,560
it's really challenging to test all

108
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,360
possible 20,000 perturbations so in this

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,280
challenge uh we're looking at about 70

110
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,199
perturbations to characterize all 20,000

111
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,519
perturbations it would take one Mark

112
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,239
Schwarz which is the who is the really

113
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,840
you know talented physician scientist to

114
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,800
perform these experiments it would take

115
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,199
him about 50 years to collect all that

116
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,960
data and likewise if we looked at

117
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,080
combinations of perturbations for

118
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,240
instance we wanted to knock out toxin

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,440
tcf7 that would be you know that would

120
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,560
require hundreds and hundreds of

121
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,199
millions of cells to really characterize

122
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,240
so the the throughput of perur seek is

123
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,000
really good but it's not infinite there

124
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,039
are limitations and our hope is with the

125
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
data science challenge is that we can

126
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,240
computationally move past some of these

127
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,360
limitations and even though we're only

128
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,680
able to measure you know a relatively

129
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,960
small number of perturbations we believe

130
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,520
that we can learn uh the effects of

131
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,720
perturbations in genes that weren't

132
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,960
measured in the experiment so in the

133
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,759
third lecture we are going to go over

134
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,639
the actual experiment that Mark Schwarz

135
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,960
did to generate the perturb seek data

136
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,880
that will be used in the data science

137
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,680
Challenge and you will see uh how to

138
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,600
manipulate that data and analyze it and

139
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,800
work with it and this will get you ready

140
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,800
to do all three tasks uh in the

141
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
challenge

142
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,300
