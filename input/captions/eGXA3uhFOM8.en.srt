00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
It would be really awesome if we could

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,240
regrow limbs just like lizards do, but

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,320
we can't. The closest we can get is kind

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,160
of sort of regenerating our livers. So,

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,719
we have these things called stem cells

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,120
which can morph or differentiate into

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,359
say a liver cell or a blood cell. When a

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,279
lizard's tail falls off, a bunch of pur

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,439
potent stem cells rush to the stump and

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,600
will differentiate into skin cells,

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,519
muscle cells or bone cells. It would

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,599
take a lot more time and energy for one

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,760
of us to regrow a whole arm. But our

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,600
livers are a little bit different. Even

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,600
if you lost 75% of your liver, the

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,879
remaining liver cells could grow and

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,399
divide and reform a mass of liver

18
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:42,160
tissue. The problem is that liver cells

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,920
don't survive long enough outside the

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,480
body to grow into enough tissue to

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,719
transplant. Scientists and MIT's lab for

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,640
multiscale regenerative technologies are

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,480
trying to solve this problem. So, for

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,600
now, our reptile friends have oneuped

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,000
us, but we're catching up. For more MIT
