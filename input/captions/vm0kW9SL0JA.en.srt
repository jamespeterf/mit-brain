00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,680
[Music]

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,400
so then we'd like to think well how can

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,400
we avoid this what are therapies uh that

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,360
we could do or apply to a patient to

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,279
shift this distribution of te- cell

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,920
States so we want to go away from being

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,920
in the terminal exhausted State and

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,840
favor progenitor te- cells in these

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,199
affector te- cell states that are good

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,480
at um dividing making more of themselves

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
and killing tumors so really part of

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,400
this challenge is thinking about how we

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,960
can shift distributions of these T Cell

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,239
States and there are therapies that do

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,160
exactly this and uh you know the most

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,160
exciting class of therapies are cancer

17
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,200
immunotherapies and cancer

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,760
immunotherapies are uh therapies that uh

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,079
actually just boost the immune system's

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,000
ability to fight cancer and there are

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,559
two uh main therapies out there immune

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
checkpoint blockade and car t- cell

23
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:58,160
therapy and both of these therapies act

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
on t- cells so they're both modifying

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,559
the te- cells in some way to make them

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,320
better at killing cancer and so I like

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,600
um you know looking at what oncologists

28
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,360
have said about these immunotherapies

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,720
and just seeing you know how much

30
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,360
improvements there's been since we've

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,799
started using immunotherapy so here's a

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,280
quote from Jason Luke saying you know

33
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,240
we're talking about diseases where we

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,360
used to tell patients uh during their

35
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,680
first clinical visit that they were

36
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,880
going to die from this cancer so really

37
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,280
really um you know immunotherapies in

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,840
certain cases have made a big difference

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,439
so uh there's two types of

40
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,200
immunotherapies we're first going to

41
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,000
talk about uh immune checkpoint blockade

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,880
so let's return to a cartoon that's

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,280
similar to what you've seen before where

44
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,240
we have a t- cell engaging with a tumor

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,360
cell or cancer cell on the surface of

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,720
the t- cell is a t- cell receptor that

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,159
recognizes the non-self antigen from the

48
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,680
cancer cell so you saw this earlier and

49
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,520
actually on T cells there's many

50
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,920
molecules so another molecule on the

51
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,280
surface of the t- cell other than the t-

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,759
cell receptor is pd1 and pd1 is a

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,479
molecule that is a major regulator of t-

54
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,439
cell exhaustion and what happens is uh

55
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,920
tumor cells Express another molecule

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,479
pdl1 which binds to pd1 and turns off

57
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,400
the t uh the T cells and keeps them from

58
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,720
activating their killing response so

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,959
anything that could really disrupt this

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,720
interaction would free the te- cells and

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,599
make them better Killers so when this uh

62
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,239
interaction is happening the te- cells

63
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,160
are kind of being driven into this

64
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,920
terminal exhausted State and so the idea

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,760
with checkpoint blockade is to disrupt

66
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,480
or block this interaction ction by

67
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,080
designing proteins or antibodies that

68
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,040
bind to pd1 and block the interaction

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,040
from ever happening so in checkpoint

70
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,239
blockade we have these antibodies they

71
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,040
block this interaction and this frees up

72
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,319
the t- cell to not go into the terminal

73
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,440
exhausted State and to stay in a

74
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,239
progenitor state or an affector State

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,640
and be able to uh kill the tumor

76
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,400
cells so now let's look at an example of

77
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,800
one of the first clinical trials that

78
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,840
was done using immune checkpoint

79
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,000
blockade so so the one of the first

80
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,959
trials was iaab which is an advanced

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,200
melanoma so that's a very uh bad stage

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,799
of the melanoma disease and here we're

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,440
looking at the results of that clinical

84
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,040
trial data where on the y- axis we have

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,799
overall survival and then on the x-axis

86
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,159
we have how long the patients uh

87
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,159
survived and so here we're seeing the

88
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,840
control uh arm of the trial where these

89
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,959
are patients who did not receive the

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,159
checkpoint blockade and then here we're

91
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,879
seeing uh the treatment with iila map

92
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,239
and so at first glance you know this is

93
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:31,159
a significant difference but it's not

94
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:32,799
maybe not a huge difference but what

95
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,480
you're seeing really in this data is

96
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,000
that you know in the control arm of the

97
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,120
trial patients are you know

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,519
unfortunately dying you know you know

99
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,360
from 8 to 12 to 16 months and with the I

100
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,400
Aluma treatment you have patients living

101
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,680
out to like 60 months a certain subset

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,159
of the patients so not everybody

103
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,680
responds toap but those who do actually

104
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:54,079
live quite longer and you know this was

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,640
a trial that was done in 2010 and since

106
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,319
then in the last 10 years there's been a

107
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,439
lot of uh advancements in immune

108
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,239
checkpoint blockade and I like this

109
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,120
quote from um Jed walchuk at Memorial s

110
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,280
ketering uh saying that when he first

111
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,400
started um you know treating patients in

112
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,239
in the year 2000 the average survival

113
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,480
for something like Advanced melanoma was

114
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,560
you know only seven months and now with

115
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,720
the latest sort of FDA approved

116
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,079
checkpoint Inhibitors average survival

117
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,560
has increased to over six years so

118
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,800
things have really got better and better

119
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,160
and better but still we have this issue

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,720
that not all patients uh respond to

121
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,280
immune checkpoint

122
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,800
blockade so the other form of of uh

123
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,520
cancer immunotherapy or the other main

124
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,160
form is car cell therapy and again like

125
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,320
checkpoint block a this is working with

126
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,360
te- cells so uh car T Cell Therapy is

127
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,080
really uh clever and cool and how it

128
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,320
works is it's actually a living drug

129
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,280
that's derived from the patient and so

130
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,919
what happens is uh the cancer patient

131
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,880
gets a blood draw and uh scientists in

132
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,759
the lab extract tea cells from that

133
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,280
blood draw and then they genetically

134
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,280
engineer the te- cells to express on

135
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,759
their surface another molecule called a

136
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,960
chimeric antigen receptor or car and

137
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,680
this car is engineered to actually

138
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,840
recognize the nonself antigen on the

139
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,000
surface of the cancer cell and so uh

140
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,160
this is something that really is you

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,960
know very clever and then what happens

142
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,400
is you take this car T Cell that's now

143
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,440
been engineered to recognize the cancer

144
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,199
cell you grow up tons and tons of them

145
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,000
millions of the cells and you infuse

146
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,840
them back into the patient and then the

147
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,120
car cell goes from the blood and

148
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,080
traffics to the tumor and starts to kill

149
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,160
the tumor cells because I recognize the

150
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,120
nonself antigen on the surface of those

151
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,759
tumor cells so this is really amazing uh

152
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,680
you know here's an example it's been

153
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,160
used to treat diffuse large B cell

154
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,240
lymphoma and 50% of treated patients

155
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,840
have a durable complete response however

156
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,800
again what about the other 50% of the

157
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,919
patients so cancer immunotherapies are

158
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,680
amazing in so many ways and they really

159
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,039
transformed the lives of a lot of cancer

160
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,919
patients however the big problem

161
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,280
everybody is really focused on is why do

162
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:02,199
these Therapies only work for some

163
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,800
people and for some cancer types and can

164
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,919
we really get these therapies to work

165
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,120
for more individuals across more types

166
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,840
of cancer so what are some of the

167
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,360
reasons cancer immunotherapy fails so

168
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,720
first in immune checkpoint blockade um

169
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,680
not all cancer cells are acting through

170
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:22,479
pd1 or the related molecule

171
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,960
ctla4 so uh in these cases checkpoint

172
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,639
blockage just doesn't work because you

173
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,280
don't have the appropriate Target now

174
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,080
also in cancer uh individuals can

175
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,560
involve resistance to the checkpoint

176
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,919
blockade therapy there are changes in

177
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,199
the cancer that result in the cancer

178
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,479
becoming resistant to checkpoint

179
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,960
blockade and this can either work by the

180
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,759
cancer cells starting to directly

181
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,039
inhibit te- cells through another

182
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,319
signaling pathway or the cancer cells

183
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,280
can start to change their surrounding

184
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,800
environment to make it suppressive to

185
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:54,120
the immune response and then finally car

186
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,080
T cells themselves can be exhausted so

187
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,800
there are a lot of efforts to address

188
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,919
these different problems and if you look

189
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,440
in clinical trials.gov there are

190
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,319
thousands of studies that are going on

191
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,160
for immune checkpoint Inhibitors and

192
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,120
thousands of studies going on for car T

193
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,319
cells so there's really this huge unmet

194
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,160
need where we need to understand what

195
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,960
can we do to tea cells to make them

196
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,560
better uh in terms of cancer

197
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,879
immunotherapy and so the big focus of

198
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,280
this challenge is really thinking about

199
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,560
what are genetic changes we can make in

200
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,039
te- cells to make them better at killing

201
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,360
cancer and that's really what we're

202
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,960
going to be uh focusing on across these

203
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,360
different tasks in the challenge and so

204
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,000
um you know to do this we really need to

205
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,520
at a basic level understand everything

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,120
we can about the pathway that leads from

207
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,000
these sort of naive T cells these

208
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,800
progenitor affector and terminal

209
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,160
exhausted t- cell States so we really

210
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,479
need to know the gene expression

211
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,759
programs and the changes responsible for

212
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:51,639
all these uh steps and uh doing this

213
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,440
really has been the work of decades and

214
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,599
furthermore we would like to not just

215
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,280
understand you know the gene expression

216
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,680
programs that are happening here but you

217
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,520
know what perturbations uh we could make

218
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,319
how they would affect this process so

219
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,039
this is a really slow process it

220
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,120
involves a lot of biological

221
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,199
experimentation however in the last

222
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,280
decade or so um our Technologies and our

223
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,000
computational approaches have really

224
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,319
empowered us to believe that we can make

225
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,919
this discovery process a lot faster and

226
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,759
that's what this challenge is really

227
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,319
about of understanding this process of

228
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,120
t- cell differentiation when they're in

229
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,120
these exhausted uh States and how we can

230
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,360
perturb the te- cells to shift them away

231
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,680
from those terminal exhausted States so

232
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,080
uh that's the overview of the biology

233
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,760
and the introduction to biology for this

234
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,399
data science Challenge and then next

235
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,200
we'll talk about uh how we actually

236
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,560
measure the cells in the immune in the

237
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,760
immune system and how we look at their

238
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,440
gene expression values and how we can

239
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,720
actually perturb the immune cells uh to

240
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,600
get you know maybe more desirable states

241
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,020
that would be more effective in a cancer

242
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,730
immunotherapy

243
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,730
