1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,320
So today we're continue once again the

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,520
road map we talked about consumer Theory

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,439
then we talk about producer Theory and

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,960
we got to the point we realize the one

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,800
place producer theory is harder than

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,199
consumer theory is you're not given a

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,760
budget constraint you're not told how

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,480
much you have you get to choose how much

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,079
you have you get to choose how much to

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,800
produce and we know for any quantity the

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,399
way you'll produce it we know the

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,840
efficient combination of inputs to

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,120
produce any quantity we developed that

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,320
last time what we don't know is how do

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,000
you choose what quantity to produce and

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,559
to get that we're going to add a third

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,559
instead of having two equations and two

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,760
unknowns we're going to add a third

19
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:52,640
element to the model and the element

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,160
we're going to add is Market structure

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,559
we're going to add an element of how

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,480
firms compete in the market okay and

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,120
essentially that is where we're going to

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,400
go for the next several

25
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,439
lectures is to think about the structure

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,720
of the market itself and how that feeds

27
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,680
back into firm's decisions on how much

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,840
to

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,400
produce okay and so that's kind of where

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,520
we're going today is to ask how do we

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,960
take the market impose it on the firm's

32
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,680
decisions from last time on that long

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,240
run expansion path we have last time to

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,040
determine how much they actually produce

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,159
we're going to start with a particular

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,360
assumption we're going to start by

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,360
talking about short run profit

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,000
maximization and we're going to start in

39
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:45,079
the particular example of a market that

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,079
features perfect

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,799
competition I'll Define this more

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,880
technically in a minute but basically

43
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,280
stepping back it's going to turn out the

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,640
firm's decisions on how much to produce

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,840
is going to depend on the kind of Market

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,840
they face and there's different types of

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,799
markets one extreme that we'll focus on

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,319
for much of this class is the extreme of

49
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:12,000
perfect competition basically many firms

50
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,959
competing to produce identical

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,239
Goods The Other Extreme would be

52
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,920
Monopoly one firm that produces the

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,599
good okay and then there's a h host of

54
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,840
examples in between indeed in between is

55
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,840
my favorite word in economics oligopoly

56
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,160
just a great sounding word okay

57
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,480
oligopoly is really the way markets

58
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,680
almost all look which is a number of

59
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,200
firms competing but not too many so say

60
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,879
we have one extreme where there's a huge

61
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,920
numbers of firms competing that's

62
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,920
perfect competition The Other Extreme

63
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,480
there's just one firm in the market

64
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,000
that's Monopoly and in between we have

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,720
oligopoly which is most Industries think

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,080
of the Auto industry there's more than

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,959
one car company but there aren't a

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,040
thousand car companies okay think about

69
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,640
most of the industries that we feature

70
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,159
uh in a modern developed economy are

71
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,720
oligopolistic okay and that's that'll be

72
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:04,400
the third place we turn so we're going

73
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,840
to start by thinking about perfect

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,440
competition then we'll turn to Monopoly

75
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,400
as always it's easiest to trace out the

76
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,440
extremes start with one extreme which is

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,239
perfect competition we'll then shift to

78
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,200
The Other Extreme which is Monopoly

79
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,120
you'll then take your midterm and then

80
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,440
we'll talk about the middle case which

81
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:26,280
is oligopoly okay so let's talk about

82
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,239
what are the assumptions of perfect

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,680
competition what are the assumptions

84
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,680
that underline perfect competition

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,680
okay

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,159
basically the key the technical

87
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,120
definition of a perfectly competitive

88
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:49,120
market is one where all

89
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,120
firms are price

90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,120
takers price

91
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:00,840
takers what do I mean by that what I

92
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,920
mean by that is that no action

93
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,280
that any given firm does can affect the

94
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,840
price in the

95
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,439
market any given firm is sufficiently

96
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,760
small Rel to the market that no action

97
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,040
any individual firm takes affects the

98
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,239
market

99
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:21,120
price well when would this be

100
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:23,040
true this would be true in the case

101
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,680
where when

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,960
demand for a firm's output is perfectly

103
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,800
elastic

104
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,039
okay demand for a firm's output not the

105
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,360
market demand but demand for a given

106
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,720
firm is perfectly elastic and we show

107
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,919
that in figure

108
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,199
71 in figure

109
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,080
71 here is a case and notice the xaxis

110
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,080
is little Q not big Q little Q is a firm

111
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,320
big Q is the market this is a firm level

112
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,880
diagram of uh the firm's production

113
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,080
decision how much produce at what price

114
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,320
in a perfectly competitive market The

115
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,919
Firm faces a perfectly elastic demand at

116
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,720
some Price p we'll talk about where P

117
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,960
comes from okay but just well by the end

118
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,919
of the lecture you know where P comes

119
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,600
from but now just say there's some Price

120
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,600
p and at that price demand is perfectly

121
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,240
elastic as a

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,120
result Supply shifts in Supply have no

123
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,479
impact on the price charged you always

124
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,560
charge the same

125
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:29,000
price okay so when does it make sense

126
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,240
that demand be perfectly elastic what

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
are the assumptions is a perfect

128
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,680
competition when does it make sense that

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,039
firms are price takers well we make

130
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,680
three key assumptions the first is

131
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,680
identical

132
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,759
products the first assumption is that

133
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,560
firms are selling identical

134
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,880
products the second assumption is that

135
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,039
there's

136
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,039
full transparent full knowledge

137
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,919
of

138
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,639
prices that is every consumer knows

139
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:10,199
every firm's

140
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:14,039
price identical products every consumer

141
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:17,120
knows every firm's price and finally no

142
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:20,160
transaction costs the third assumption

143
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,160
no transaction

144
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,680
costs meaning you can easily shop at any

145
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,319
firm you

146
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,720
want the products are identical

147
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,479
you know every firm's price and you can

148
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,840
easily shop at as many firms as you want

149
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:40,479
okay now this is obviously untrue for

150
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,120
any Market in the world but once again

151
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,080
the extremes provide a useful example a

152
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,520
close example would be

153
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,800
eBay think about eBay for a very common

154
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,280
good buying a certain type of of silicon

155
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,680
chip on eBay or a certain type of kind

156
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,360
of food or a certain type of you know a

157
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,400
shirt of a certain size and style okay

158
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,680
the the products are identical the

159
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,160
prices are all listed there and it's

160
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,720
easy to shop there's no you just look at

161
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,479
the list there's no transaction costs so

162
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,520
in

163
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,560
theory okay eBay fits these conditions

164
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,280
in practice it doesn't and why is

165
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,680
that how does eBay violate how does

166
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,479
shoping eBay violate all these

167
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,759
conditions what are some some reasons

168
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:24,560
why shoing eBay isn't perfectly

169
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,039
competitive

170
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,759
yeah yeah basically you don't really

171
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,720
know the price indeed for many years

172
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:35,080
eBay would would not would rank firms by

173
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,240
the price excluding shipping we call

174
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,479
that a shrouded attribute in technical

175
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,720
terms they would sort of hide the cost

176
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,560
of shipping so really you weren't really

177
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,560
competing on prices what

178
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,400
else well it's hard to find truly

179
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,159
identical products on eBay every

180
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,720
product's a little bit different okay so

181
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,720
there's a lot and if you if products are

182
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,039
different you have to look into it

183
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,520
suddenly that takes time that's a

184
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,240
transaction cost so even eBay which is

185
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,919
sort of the canonical example perfectly

186
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,520
competitive market isn't probably my

187
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:08,479
favorite example is if you go to a

188
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,280
tourist site particularly developing in

189
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,120
sort of in in many countries there'll be

190
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,919
lots of people selling the same

191
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,919
around the tourist site so think of the

192
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,280
Eiffel Tower there are literally

193
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,159
hundreds of guys who have spread out

194
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,000
blankets saying the Sal on the same damn

195
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:27,560
little Eiffel Tower

196
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,759
keychain okay now there I can easily see

197
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,199
what people are charging they're right

198
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,800
next to each other little transaction

199
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:34,000
costs I can see it's the same damn

200
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,560
keychain and it's not that hard just ask

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,519
what the price is so that is an example

202
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,159
in fact I taught that example in my

203
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,560
online class and a student actually I

204
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,719
got a package in the mail once and I

205
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,240
opened it it was a bunch of little

206
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,760
Eiffel Tower keychains fell out and

207
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,880
someone said they'd gone and done the

208
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,600
exploration and it turns out all the

209
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,560
sellers right near the Eiffel Tower did

210
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,720
charge identical price once you got

211
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,720
further away it was a different price

212
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,519
why because that wasn't identical

213
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,959
anymore you know a different spot but

214
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,120
everyone right around the Tower card is

215
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,880
exactly the same price for the little

216
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,880
Eiffel Tower for the little EI Eiffel

217
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,519
Tower statue at which is pretty cool

218
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,440
okay so that's the kind of Market we

219
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,600
have in

220
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:15,360
mind okay now let me highlight one thing

221
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,640
once again this is little Q not big

222
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,320
Q this does not say the market demand is

223
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,839
perfectly elastic the demand for any

224
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,519
given firm is perfect elastic I'm not

225
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,920
saying the demand for Eiffel ties for

226
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:30,079
statuettes in general is perfectly

227
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,480
elastic I'm saying that a cross seller

228
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:36,480
uh The Firm specific demand is perfectly

229
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,240
elastic okay armed with these

230
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,560
assumptions and what a competitive

231
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,120
market is we can now talk about how do

232
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,120
firms maximize

233
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:51,519
profits okay how do firms maximize

234
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:55,519
profits well basically firms want to

235
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,120
choose the optimal quantity to maximize

236
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,399
profits as a function of Q which equals

237
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,959
Revenue as a function of Q Minus cost

238
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,440
the function of

239
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:06,959
Q okay all firms are choosing is Q

240
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,079
they're not price makers they're price

241
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,680
takers they don't choose the price they

242
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,800
just the price is whatever when they set

243
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,120
up their blank in front of the Eiffel

244
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,760
Tower they find whatever else is

245
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,839
charging okay there's no there's

246
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,360
basically no uh no scope to set the

247
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,079
price all they can decide is how much

248
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,120
quantity they want to sell and how they

249
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,120
want to make it they have control over

250
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,920
their costs so basically if we set take

251
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,399
the set equal to zero this says that

252
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,399
if we set if we take the derivative and

253
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:36,000
set equals zero to optimize this this

254
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,560
says that Dr DQ equals

255
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,639
dcdq and this is the fun this is it this

256
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,800
is profit maximization in one

257
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:46,279
equation okay basically you want to set

258
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,200
the marginal revenue equal to the

259
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,079
marginal

260
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,440
cost well in a competitive market we

261
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:54,600
know what the marginal revenue is what

262
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,160
do you get from selling the next unit

263
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,839
well you get the market price P it's

264
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,519
given to you the margin revenue is

265
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,760
always p whenever you sell the next unit

266
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,440
you get P we'll talk later about markets

267
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,920
where that's not true where the price

268
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,320
you get depends on how much you sell but

269
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,079
in a competitive market that's not true

270
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,920
no matter what you sell you get P it's a

271
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,440
flat

272
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:19,480
line okay and we know what dcdq is it's

273
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,480
marginal cost so profit maximization in

274
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,800
a perfectly competitive market means

275
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,160
setting price equal to marginal

276
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,120
cost this is the rule for profit

277
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,880
maximization in a perfectly competitive

278
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,240
market this is the general for any

279
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,240
Market any Market's going to set

280
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,360
marginal equal to Marginal costs that's

281
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,120
going to translate a perfectly

282
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,480
competitive market into price equals

283
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,760
marginal

284
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,519
cost okay so for example let's go back

285
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:48,920
to a cost curve we're using last time

286
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:50,839
let's imagine cost = 10 + 5 q^2 and we

287
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,600
know how to derive that we did that last

288
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:59,399
time so let's go to figure

289
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,200
72 okay and let's assume P equals 30

290
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,680
just to make life easy we'll assume P

291
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,320
equals 30 assume and I'll tell you later

292
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,639
where that comes from but for now just

293
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:12,480
take it as given okay the left panel

294
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:15,320
shows uh the left panel of this graph

295
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,639
shows how costs and revenues evolve as

296
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,800
cost

297
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:23,399
increase okay so basically when you for

298
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,680
every the revenue line is a line with a

299
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,000
slope of 30 why because every unit you

300
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,600
sell you get 30 that's the price the

301
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,120
cost line is the graph we saw last time

302
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:37,880
of the cost function t 10 plus 5

303
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,199
q^2 okay so basically what you see and

304
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,320
so you can translate that to the right

305
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:45,920
hand graph which is what is the

306
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,920
profit you earn on every unit

307
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,519
sold okay so basically what that says

308
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:55,720
the first if if you're selling zero

309
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,720
units you're losing money because what

310
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,839
what's the

311
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:03,480
revenue zero what's the cost

312
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,040
10 10 plus 5 squ at Z is 10 so your

313
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,959
profit is

314
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:12,279
-1 but as you sell units your profits

315
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:15,560
rise okay until you get to the third

316
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:17,760
unit okay where each each of the first

317
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,440
second and third units each of those

318
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,000
first three units the money you make by

319
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,760
selling the next unit is higher than the

320
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,160
cost of producing the next

321
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,360
unit the money you make from selling the

322
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,000
the next unit is higher than the cost of

323
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,680
producing in the next unit but once

324
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,720
you've reached three

325
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,600
units okay that's no longer true when

326
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,440
you go to producing the fourth unit the

327
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,480
money you make on the fourth unit is

328
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,519
less than the cost of the fourth

329
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,560
unit the money you make on the fourth

330
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:54,120
unit is less than the cost of the fourth

331
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,800
unit that's why profit maximization much

332
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,000
like utility maximization is a hill

333
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,920
climbing exercise remember I said in

334
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,880
economics we can do marginal decision

335
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,880
making here is sort of an

336
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,519
example okay of marginal decision making

337
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,240
the idea of marginal decision making is

338
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,519
you think of yourself as climbing a

339
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,720
mountain that's in the clouds and you're

340
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,320
trying to to the top of the mountain but

341
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,160
you can't see more than one step in

342
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,880
front of you if you take a step forward

343
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,639
and you go up you know you're heading up

344
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,680
the mountain take a step forward and you

345
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,800
go down you know you're heading down the

346
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,560
mountain you don't need to know where

347
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,920
the top of the mountain is just need to

348
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,800
know where you're heading up or down and

349
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,160
when you've reached the point where the

350
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,720
next step takes you down then you're at

351
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,160
the top that's what we're doing here

352
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,079
we're not saying we don't look at what

353
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,040
the problem maximizing quantity is we

354
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,800
solve for it we ask does the next unit

355
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,240
make money does the revenue made off the

356
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,600
next unit exceed the cost of produce to

357
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,560
the next unit is that next step taking

358
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,079
you up the hill or down the hill and

359
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,839
that's how we do profit

360
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:55,160
maximization you could see this in

361
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,160
figure

362
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,680
73 here we are actually taking our cost

363
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,959
curves

364
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,759
and adding a adding Revenue so the

365
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,120
curves on figure 73 are the same as the

366
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:08,399
ones we developed last time same as the

367
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,240
first figure in the last lecture all

368
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,480
I've done here is I've added a line at P

369
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,399
equals

370
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,399
30 okay I've added a line at P equals 30

371
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,800
that dash line by the way uh should go

372
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,399
all the way to the y- AIS we're missing

373
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,399
a little connection there um but there's

374
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,399
a line at P equals

375
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,360
30

376
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,639
so what how do we solve for a firm's

377
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,920
decision well what's through approximate

378
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,399
profit maximization you set price equal

379
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,800
to marginal cost where does price equal

380
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,920
marginal cost well it happens when

381
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,360
marginal cost equals 30 so the first

382
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,480
step is you find the point at which

383
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,839
marginal cost equals price that is

384
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,160
producing three

385
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,519
units that is the point at which price

386
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,279
equals marginal cost that is the profit

387
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,160
maximizing

388
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,880
point the second question is what are

389
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,639
the profits at that

390
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,959
point what are the profits at that point

391
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,720
well what is the average cost cost at

392
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:07,720
that point the average cost when you're

393
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:12,759
producing three units is 10 over three

394
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:17,279
plus uh plus 10 over 3 + 5 *

395
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:20,480
3 uh 10 over 3 + 5times uh 5 time 9

396
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:25,000
sorry because q^ squ okay the average

397
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:27,600
cost is 10 over3 plus 5 * 9 let me see

398
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,600
what I got wrong

399
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,519
here uh uh oh I'm sorry no you divide by

400
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,360
Q sorry you divide by average cost is 5

401
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:39,759
time 3 because average cost is 10 over 3

402
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,360
+ 5 q average cost is 10 over is is

403
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,519
dividing this by three by by Q so it's

404
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,720
10 over three plus 5 q is the average

405
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:51,120
cost the total costs are 10 + 5 * 9 the

406
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,600
the average costs are 10 over 3 + 5 * 3

407
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,600
which equals 18.33%

408
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,759
[Music]

409
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:04,759
on average each unit you sell cost you

410
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,759
18.33%

411
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,679
times the number of units sold you're

412
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:38,559
making 11.67 per unit you're selling

413
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,000
three units so your total profit is 40

414
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,360
which is the area of that box let's go

415
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,240
over it again you set price equal the

416
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,960
marginal cost that determines that

417
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,600
determines the top of the hill that is

418
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,120
true producing three

419
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,919
units at three units your profits are

420
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,960
your revenues minus your costs we can

421
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,720
divide both by Q Sayes Revenue per unit

422
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,400
Minus cost per unit unit times Q so

423
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,799
profits okay is revenue Minus cost we

424
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,960
can also write that as Revenue over Q

425
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,400
Minus cost over Q time Q right just

426
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,760
pulling out multiplying dividing by Q

427
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,280
well Revenue per Q at

428
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,679
three is 30 that's flat number it's a

429
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:24,200
flat line cost per Q at

430
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,200
30 are are 18.33%

431
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,200
okay questions about

432
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,159
that so that's how we determine the

433
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,799
firm's

434
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,640
profits okay so let me stress test you

435
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:46,600
on this someone tell me what happens to

436
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:50,039
the cost function if a firm has to pay a

437
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,600
tax of $10 per unit at

438
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:56,159
Sals we start with this cost

439
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:00,720
function now I want to add a tax of $10

440
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,720
per unit what is the new cost function

441
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:11,360
yeah exactly the new cost function is 10

442
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:13,840
+ 5 q^2 plus 10 Q many people often say

443
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,880
20 plus 5 q^2 usually that's the typical

444
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,880
first answer I get that's wrong that' be

445
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,440
true if the firm only had to pay an

446
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:26,120
extra $10 flat but they pay $10 per unit

447
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,120
so it's 10 plus 5 q ^2 + 10 Q what does

448
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,320
that

449
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,200
do to our cas

450
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,480
well what that means is now marginal

451
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:39,840
cost if we differentiate this with

452
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:43,480
respect to Q is 10 q+ 10 marginal cost

453
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,679
used to be 10 Q now it's 10 Q + 10 so

454
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,720
the marginal cost curve is shifted up

455
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,559
all the cost curves are shifted up so

456
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:55,400
now marginal cost equals

457
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:59,400
price equals price at 2 units 10 Q + 10

458
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,559
equal 30 which is the price at

459
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,919
qar equals

460
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,640
2 I set marginal cost equal the price

461
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,960
this is the new marginal cost 10 Q Plus

462
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,480
10 I set that equal to 30 which is the

463
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,880
price I get the new qars too so

464
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,159
quantity's fallen from three to

465
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,960
two the price hasn't

466
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:20,480
changed why is quantity Fallen because

467
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,919
it's more expensive to produce and

468
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,400
you're always trading off the benefit of

469
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,520
producing the next unit against the cost

470
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,480
of producing the next unit the benefit

471
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,919
hasn't changed the cost has gone up so

472
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,880
you produce fewer

473
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:37,200
units what does that mean for profits

474
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,159
well look what's happened of profits

475
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,400
they've shrunken from the larger

476
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,039
rectangle to the smaller rectangle two

477
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,720
things have changed first of all you're

478
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:49,080
selling fewer

479
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,400
units so the width of the rectangles

480
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,799
changed I see triangle rectangles the

481
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,240
width of rectangles

482
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,799
changed second of all you're making less

483
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,159
money per unit why are you making less

484
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,919
money per unit because average costs are

485
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,360
up

486
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:06,880
two marginal costs are up but average

487
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,880
costs are up two so in this case you you

488
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,120
make less profits per

489
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,400
unit okay so you make less profits per

490
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,840
unit and you're selling fewer units so

491
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,760
the profit rectangle is shrunk from the

492
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,559
larger one to the smaller one that's an

493
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,679
example of how changes in cost structure

494
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,919
I didn't have to make the tax I can make

495
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,840
any change in cost structure how changes

496
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,039
in cost structure can

497
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,320
impact uh firms

498
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,480
profits okay questions about

499
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,200
that all

500
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,520
right now there's one additional feature

501
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,200
to make this even

502
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:48,320
harder in the short run which is we need

503
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,320
to decide whether the firm will shut

504
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,559
down I've just told you how to maximize

505
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,840
profits set peal the marginal cost but

506
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,799
we're not quite

507
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,840
done and that's because in the short run

508
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,440
losing money is not necessarily a reason

509
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,919
to shut

510
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,880
down you can lose money and want to stay

511
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,559
in

512
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,919
business and the reason is because

513
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:13,919
staying in the business allows you to

514
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:16,279
reoptimize in the long run so for

515
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,760
example imagine the price for this good

516
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:20,440
suddenly dropped to

517
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:25,080
$10 let's go let's not have the tax

518
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:32,039
let's go back to marginal cost equals 10

519
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:34,760
Q okay and imagine the um uh the um the

520
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:38,400
margin the price is just falling to $10

521
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:42,159
the price is $10 equals 10 so that says

522
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,279
a qar equals one right margin cost

523
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,000
equals a price margin that says qar

524
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:49,360
equals one what is your profits

525
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,679
producing one well profits are fixed Co

526
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:56,679
are 10 plus 5 q^2 which is five are the

527
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,679
costs I'm sorry that's the cost you get

528
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:02,919
a revenue of 10 and you have cost cost

529
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:05,120
of 10 plus 5 so your profits are neg

530
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:07,159
five your profits are negative five

531
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,200
you're losing money because you sell for

532
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:13,320
10 and the cost remember our cost

533
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,159
formula it's 10 plus 5 q^2 so your costs

534
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,880
are

535
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,760
15 so you lose

536
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,240
money should you stop

537
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,559
production and the answer is no and why

538
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,000
not why should you keep going even

539
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,799
though you're losing

540
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,520
money and remember the key is

541
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,760
opportunity cost yeah is they covering

542
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,760
the cost of a variable yep well you're

543
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,039
one step ahead what would happen if you

544
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,840
produce zero what would your profits be

545
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:45,279
then no what would your profits be if

546
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,279
you produce

547
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,279
zero minus 10 because you got to pay the

548
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,559
fixed cost no matter what just plug zero

549
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,880
into this formula if you produce zero

550
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,600
your profits are minus 10 so you're

551
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,200
better off producing one than zero

552
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,120
you've already given the answer answer

553
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,120
why but you're better off producing one

554
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,200
even though you're losing money the

555
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:09,039
opportunity cost of shutting down is you

556
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,760
actually lose 10 so you're better off

557
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,799
losing

558
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,440
five and why is that why would you want

559
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,000
to produce losing money it's because in

560
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,039
the long run you could change your fixed

561
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,640
costs so you can come back the next

562
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:22,400
period and make it up so when you want

563
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,279
to shut down is not about whether you

564
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,679
lose

565
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:29,120
money it's about whether you lose so

566
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:31,720
much money that over comes your fixed

567
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,720
costs when will that be true well this

568
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,559
gentleman gave the answer that will be

569
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,000
true when ignoring fixed costs you still

570
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,559
lose money that'll be true when your

571
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,279
variable costs are below Revenue it will

572
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:49,080
be true when

573
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:51,679
PQ okay is less than your variable cost

574
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,480
fixed costs are in the short run sunk

575
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,799
they're relevant you already paid them

576
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,200
you're just want to ask for the next

577
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,840
unit will I make any money

578
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,919
okay or in other words you will keep

579
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,720
producing as long as p is is as long as

580
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:11,520
P isn't less than DC over Q the variable

581
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,120
cost over Q as long as the price which

582
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,039
we call average variable

583
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,120
costs so as long as the price is above

584
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,039
average variable costs you will keep

585
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,399
producing only once price drops below

586
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:27,000
average variable costs we stop producing

587
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:30,640
we call this the shutdown

588
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:33,760
Rule now it turns out in our case that's

589
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:36,360
never true because if you look at our

590
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,120
formula variable costs so our cost

591
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:43,480
function is Cal 10 + 5 q

592
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:47,000
^2 so variable costs are 5

593
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:51,640
q^2 average variable costs are 5

594
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,240
q okay average variable costs are 5

595
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:59,520
q I'm sorry five five uh average R cost

596
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:01,440
are 5 q now remember for our case

597
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,760
for this case the general formula for

598
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,640
optimization is margin cost equals price

599
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,080
so that's 10 Q equals P that's our

600
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,159
optimization condition 10 Q equals P

601
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:15,520
margin cost equals price well if you

602
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:18,159
plug so if you plug that in you get that

603
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,919
average variable cost terms of price is

604
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,480
0.5 time

605
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,080
P so what I did here I created the

606
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,039
variable cost I divide to make average

607
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,799
variable cost which is 5 q i then

608
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:31,039
substituted in from the optim ation

609
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:35,840
condition to get average varable cost

610
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:37,799
0.5 time P well 0.5 time P can never be

611
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,480
greater than

612
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:43,840
P average this number 0.5 times P can

613
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,039
never be greater than price this

614
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,880
condition can never

615
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,679
hold as a result with this cost function

616
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,880
you'll never shut

617
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,840
down it doesn't matter what profits are

618
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,120
you will not shut down okay this is a

619
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:00,320
confusing concept that you need to work

620
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:03,720
on but but it's important to remember

621
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,080
that when we develop Supply curves we

622
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,000
have to consider both what the supply

623
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,399
curve looks like and the short run

624
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,320
whether you want to shut down okay this

625
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:12,039
is something you have to practice it's

626
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,679
always a confusing concept but we'll

627
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:17,600
give you some practice on

628
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,480
that now armed with all this we can come

629
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,960
back to actually creating what you

630
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,440
wanted you demand and you said John

631
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,640
where does that supply curve come from I

632
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,799
need to know and I'm going to tell you

633
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,600
now where Supply curves comes from now

634
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:33,159
we get to wrap it all up where supply

635
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,320
curve come from well that's in figure

636
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:37,480
75 figure

637
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:41,240
75 shows

638
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:43,519
you how much the firm wants to produce

639
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,200
at different levels of

640
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,640
prices well when the price is 30 we know

641
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,480
it wants to produce three

642
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,799
units when the price is 40 it says

643
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,120
margin cost equal the price that turns

644
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:57,399
out to be four units it turns out the

645
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,760
firm's production decision is firm's

646
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:02,399
production curve is the marginal cost

647
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,440
curve the supply curve is the marginal

648
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,960
cost

649
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,480
curve that so we already two lectures

650
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,080
ago told you or maybe was last lecture

651
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,640
told you what Supply is supply curve is

652
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,799
the marginal cost curve and think about

653
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,240
the intuition the demand curve one

654
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:18,960
second the demand curve was the marginal

655
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,159
willingness to pay for a good the demand

656
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,279
curve was how much you're willing to pay

657
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,240
for the next good the supply curve is

658
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:26,360
the marginal cost of producing the next

659
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,200
good the supply curve is what does it

660
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,960
cost you produce the next good so so

661
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,760
demand and Supply meat where and I'll

662
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,559
get to that in a couple lectures where

663
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,799
marginal willingness to pay for the good

664
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,720
how much you willing to pay for the next

665
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,360
good equals the marginal cost of

666
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,880
producing that next good that's we get

667
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,880
equilibrium yeah it's question

668
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:51,240
here like the right side is the average

669
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,240
average average variable

670
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:59,080
cost no because I divided it's let me do

671
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,720
I did P * Q is than variable cost I then

672
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,399
divided both sides by Q so price should

673
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,799
be less than variable than than average

674
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:05,799
variable

675
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:16,000
cost no let back this is a general

676
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,120
formula you'll shut down when price is

677
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,720
less than variable costs that's the

678
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,240
general formula okay then I said in our

679
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,720
case what is average variable cost it's

680
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:29,480
5 q okay now in equilibrium we know what

681
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,159
Q is

682
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,880
we know Q is p over 10 so I can just

683
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,720
plug that

684
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,360
in and then I show for our case this

685
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,360
formula never

686
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:48,480
hold giv Q

687
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:51,399
what Q at no not equilibrium at profit

688
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,279
maximization given Q if a firm is profit

689
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:55,880
maximizing they'll use this rule Mar to

690
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:57,039
cost equals price if they use that rule

691
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,919
they'll never shut

692
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,440
down okay does that make sense okay good

693
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,080
question good clarification other

694
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,080
questions about

695
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,720
this uh that's a great point we are we

696
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,000
we we're dealing in integer worlds you

697
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,679
can but you can do the whole thing

698
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,559
fractionally the the mathematics still

699
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,240
holds the mathematics still holds you

700
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:23,120
just want really we're always doing sort

701
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,399
of it's a derivative ultimately the

702
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,120
question is for the next Epsilon unit of

703
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:30,760
production

704
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,600
is the variable cost greater than the

705
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:35,880
price you can sell it

706
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,880
for okay

707
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:52,960
yeah yes I because it implies ABC equals

708
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:55,480
5 Q and 10 Q equals P so I plugged

709
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,200
in

710
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,559
yep okay so now so the point is the

711
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,600
short run supply curve is simply the

712
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,960
marginal cost curve but above the

713
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,639
shutdown

714
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,360
Point S supply curve has two things it's

715
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:10,679
a marginal cost curve but only above the

716
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,080
shutdown point in our case there is no

717
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:16,120
shutdown point so it's irrelevant but in

718
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:19,200
general the rule is the short run supply

719
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,880
curve is the marginal cost curve above

720
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,799
the shutdown point is the technical

721
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,159
definition of the short run supply curve

722
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,639
so it's above minimum average variable

723
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,240
cost so technically the short run supply

724
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:34,120
curve is the marginal cost curve above

725
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,200
minimum average variable

726
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,360
costs and that's for the supply curve

727
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,279
comes

728
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,720
from now that is the firm supply curve

729
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,760
but we started this course with markets

730
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,159
so let's go to markets what does the

731
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,519
market supply curve look like okay so I

732
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:51,880
showed you the firm Supply 76 what does

733
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:53,880
the market supply curve look like well

734
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:58,000
let's go to figure

735
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,760
77 imagine initially we have one firm

736
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,159
that's

737
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,000
S1 we know what that firm supply curve

738
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:04,639
looks like we just developed it at a

739
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,679
price of 10 they produce one at a price

740
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:07,639
of 30 they produce three and so on

741
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:11,559
that's

742
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:14,639
S1 now let's add a second identical

743
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:18,000
firm well now at a price of 10 you get

744
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:19,639
one produced by each firm that's two and

745
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,600
at a price of 30 you get three produced

746
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:24,880
by each firm that's

747
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:29,279
six now let's add a third identical firm

748
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:32,840
and so on as you add identical firms the

749
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,320
market supply curve is a flatter version

750
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,760
of The Firm supply curve in other words

751
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:41,120
market supply is a more elastic version

752
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,559
of firm

753
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,840
Supply market supply is a more elastic

754
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:48,039
version of firm Supply so as more

755
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,559
identical firms produce the

756
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:54,760
good as more identical firms produce the

757
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:57,760
good the more elastic is the supply

758
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,760
curve

759
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,120
okay now this will give you a hint to

760
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,480
where ahead next time just want to ask

761
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,840
question about next time if I said

762
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,880
competitive markets have an infinite

763
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,760
number of firms and I said The more

764
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,320
firms are the more elastic is supply

765
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,799
curve think about what that implies to

766
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,519
the supply curve and we'll talk about

767
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:20,279
where next time about how that

768
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:21,559
works but for now let's talk about one

769
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,799
one more thing and I want to go back and

770
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:25,039
redo it all to make it clear the last

771
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:27,279
thing I want to talk about is the long

772
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,240
run supply curve so far I've been

773
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,600
talking about the short run

774
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,120
only what about the long run supply

775
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,279
curve well it turns out the long run

776
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,240
supply curve is just the marginal cost

777
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,080
curve but without the shutdown rule

778
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,039
because in the long run if profits are

779
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,399
negative you do shut down because in the

780
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,760
long run fixed costs aren't fixed right

781
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:48,120
so in the long run the supply curve is

782
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,960
just the marginal cost curve full

783
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,159
stop okay as long as profits are greater

784
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,080
than zero there's no shutdown rule as

785
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:56,519
long as you're making money you pick a

786
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,559
point where price equals marginal cost

787
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,440
the only difference in the short run the

788
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:00,639
long long run here is in the long run

789
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,919
you don't have this extra knowing

790
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:06,159
shutdown rule it's just basically the

791
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,559
long supply curve is marginal costs as

792
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,079
long as marginal as long as price is

793
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,919
above as long as profits are greater

794
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:14,800
than

795
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:16,839
zero okay so that is uh the long the the

796
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,200
long run so the idea is in the short run

797
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:20,520
you're willing to lose money because you

798
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,960
can always reoptimize your Capital you

799
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,879
can always go back and change your fix

800
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,960
costs but in the long run you've already

801
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:26,000
optimized and if you've done all your

802
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,839
optimizing you're still losing money

803
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,639
you're just out of luck you just

804
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,520
you you should get out of the business

805
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,000
okay because there's no more

806
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,960
optimization you can

807
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:40,760
do all right questions about

808
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:45,359
that all right so let's now put this all

809
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,359
together to derive the short run

810
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:53,919
equilibrium I'm going to mathematically

811
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,680
get you back

812
00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:00,599
to where we started in the first lecture

813
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,119
okay I'm going to start with The

814
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:07,000
Primitives okay how do you find short e

815
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,440
the first is Step a is you get the

816
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,440
supply

817
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:14,079
curve how do you get the supply curve

818
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,280
well we know all the steps you start

819
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,640
with the production function step one

820
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,440
start with a production function in our

821
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,640
case the production function was Q

822
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:28,119
equals square root of L *

823
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,119
K that's step one

824
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,760
step two is you get input prices which

825
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,400
once again are still given at this point

826
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,119
we haven't endogenized them they're

827
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:40,040
still given and we had wal 5 R equals

828
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:42,599
10

829
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,000
okay step three I'm sorry you have your

830
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,119
assumptions and then the third thing is

831
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,640
you have a fixed amount of capital K Bar

832
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:51,400
equals 1 so you start with production

833
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,280
function you have your three assumptions

834
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,640
once again we know where K Bar equals 1

835
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,760
comes from that comes from long run

836
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,000
optimization where W and R come from you

837
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,000
haven't learned yet okay but in the

838
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,800
short run K fix so you start production

839
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,160
fun you have those three things we know

840
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,760
based on that how to develop a cost

841
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,520
function okay we know how to develop a

842
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,400
cost function we know that with these

843
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,280
three we devel we developed in a

844
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,359
previous lecture that with this

845
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,280
production function and these three

846
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:24,119
assumptions you get that the cost as a

847
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,400
function of quantity is 10 + 5 q^2 we

848
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,599
developed that in the previous lecture

849
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,280
Okay so I said if I give you a

850
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,680
production

851
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,480
function I give you an amount of capital

852
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,640
and I give you input prices you can

853
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,079
solve for the firm's cost function you

854
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,520
know how to do that now okay now if you

855
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,079
know the firm's cost function you know

856
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,760
marginal cost well marginal cost is just

857
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:52,880
the derivative of cost Spector quantity

858
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,880
which in our case is 10

859
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:03,640
Q okay we also know

860
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,920
know that in the firms maximize profits

861
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,920
when marginal cost equals

862
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:18,319
price in other words the supply curve

863
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:18,319
is Q equals 10 equals p over

864
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,200
10 qal p over 10 is our supply curve

865
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,960
we've just developed the supply curve

866
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,119
all I had to tell you to get the supply

867
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,640
curve was was a production function and

868
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,079
those three key input assumptions based

869
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,079
on that you have all you need to develop

870
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:36,000
a supply

871
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,480
curve you then have to check the

872
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,560
shutdown condition which we know in this

873
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,480
case is irrelevant but you have to check

874
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:47,280
it so it's Q go p over 10

875
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,160
where average variable cost is greater

876
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,119
than price which we know is always W

877
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,480
which we know is always

878
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:56,200
true I'm sorry where price is great is

879
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,720
less everywh cost less than price I'm

880
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,640
sorry which we know is always true in

881
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:04,440
this case so that's a supply

882
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,640
curve okay we've just developed it and I

883
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,960
only had to give you I only had to give

884
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,079
you two things the production function

885
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,079
and those and those three assumptions

886
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:17,240
questions about that

887
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:19,160
yeah 5q squ so basically um just quick

888
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,280
quick math on this okay let's go back

889
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,400
and do the math on this real quickly

890
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:26,960
just to review okay take this production

891
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:30,520
function okay Q equals uh square of k l

892
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:36,319
break out L that's q^2 over K

893
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:39,720
Bar L is Q2 over K Bar okay then then

894
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:43,280
reexpress then write a cost equation as

895
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:46,599
a function of just Q you can H you can

896
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,680
write that as cost K and Q I'm sorry

897
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:50,680
write cost equals 10

898
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:57,839
K plus 5 q ^2 over K

899
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,839
bar I just because that's the amount

900
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,640
that's the right that's the amount of

901
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:04,040
Labor you want to use so that's your

902
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:08,560
cost function you plug in K Bar equal 1

903
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:13,319
and you get Cal 10 plus 5 q 5

904
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:16,880
q^2 okay does that make sense yep you

905
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:19,319
bet okay so now we have the firm supply

906
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:23,400
curve The Firm supply

907
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:23,400
curve leads us to step

908
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:29,359
B which is we got to make a market

909
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,359
supply

910
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,839
curve well to make the market supply

911
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,599
curve we need to know how many firms are

912
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,480
in the

913
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,480
market now I'm gonna have to throw

914
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,800
another assumption at you next time I'll

915
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,680
tell you where to get this from okay all

916
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,640
the assumptions I making you're

917
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,079
eventually going to know where they come

918
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,800
from you know where W comes from and R

919
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,800
comes from and K comes from another

920
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,680
subject I'm going to throw at you is

921
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,720
little n the number of firms in the

922
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,720
market and let's just assume for now

923
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,520
little n equals

924
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,880
6 and I'll tell you next lecture how you

925
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,040
get that but for now it's useful to

926
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,839
start with an assumption assume there's

927
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,839
six firms in the market so what is the

928
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:08,760
total quantity in the market well the

929
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:12,480
total quantity is just six little

930
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:15,680
q's and we know little Q equals p over

931
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,720
10 we know little Q equals P we know

932
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,480
little Q equals p over 10 so the supply

933
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,000
curve is qals 35ths time P that's the

934
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,240
market supply curve which is just the

935
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,520
firm supply curve applied to six firms

936
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,599
that's the market supply

937
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:36,119
curve that's step

938
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:38,200
two step three is you have a demand

939
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:39,480
curve now I'm not going to go back

940
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,440
through all the math of that we spent a

941
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,960
couple lectures on this but you know how

942
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,280
to dve a demand curve as long as I give

943
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,720
you prices and income and utility you

944
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,480
know how to drive a demand curve you've

945
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,079
done that you do it on the problem set

946
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,119
you'll do it a bunch of times let's say

947
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,079
in this case just to make life easy

948
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,839
theand curve I get if I do that is 48

949
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:59,760
qal 48 minus

950
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:01,720
the market demand

951
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,920
curve okay I'm not going to go back

952
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,760
through all those steps because that's

953
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,960
that' be too much but hopefully you can

954
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,000
go back and review your consumer Theory

955
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,000
to get that okay and I'm just I mean

956
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,480
just making this up for this example but

957
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,359
you know how to derive a demand curve so

958
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,680
now we get

959
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:22,520
equilibrium is

960
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:24,040
where demand equals Supply where 48

961
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:28,839
minus

962
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:31,640
P equals 35ths p two

963
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:33,440
equations okay we had two we we had we

964
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,480
we set we set these equal to each other

965
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,040
to get

966
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:42,000
equilibrium so we get that

967
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:45,079
qar equals

968
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,160
18 the market the equilibrium quantity

969
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:51,119
in the market is

970
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,400
18 why because I know the market supply

971
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,200
curve I know the market demand curve

972
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,480
which I just made up for this case but

973
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,800
you know where it could you know how to

974
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,680
get one I set them equal to each other

975
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:06,640
and I get qar equals

976
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:08,400
18 okay but that's the market supply

977
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,760
what about each firm you want to know

978
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,480
what each firm's going to

979
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,359
produce well we

980
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,720
know that there's six firms in this

981
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,960
market and they're

982
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,760
identical so that

983
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,240
means that in this market each firm for

984
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:29,119
qar to be 18 little

985
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,119
qar must be three

986
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,880
well how do we know if that's the case

987
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:37,480
well we

988
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,680
know we know

989
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:46,440
that if qar equals 18 what's the price

990
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:53,400
well we know Q equals 35ths

991
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:53,400
P so if qar equals 18 P star equals what

992
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,440
30 right it's two equations and two

993
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:04,800
unknowns one equation was Q = 48 minus P

994
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,280
one equation was q = 35ths p I solved

995
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,000
them for qar but I I'll solve for p star

996
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,480
P star is 30 okay you can get it from

997
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,599
the man curve too 48 minus 18 is

998
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:17,880
30 okay so P star is

999
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:20,040
30 well we know each firm sets price

1000
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,839
equal to marginal cost so now we can go

1001
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,839
back to get the firm

1002
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,680
Supply firm supplies where price equals

1003
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:34,160
Mar marginal cost price is 30 marginal

1004
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:38,880
cost is 10 Q so optimal firm production

1005
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:42,319
is three which is what it has to

1006
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,640
be the magic of this Market is that each

1007
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:47,000
firm is prodes exactly what the

1008
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,000
aggregate Market says they should

1009
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:52,319
produce okay so basically we Sol we took

1010
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,960
a firm we took

1011
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,839
firms we built them up to the firms that

1012
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,079
were taking a given price remember we

1013
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:01,200
went to the firm we didn't specify price

1014
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:02,599
price is they're price takers that's

1015
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,280
just given from God from their

1016
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:05,880
perspective okay you just when you set

1017
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,520
up your blanket outside the F Tower just

1018
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,839
look what everybody else is

1019
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:15,040
charging okay we then so we left P to be

1020
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,960
solved for we then use demand we then

1021
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,760
take that firm decision make it a market

1022
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:24,640
decision okay we then said we'll set

1023
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:27,640
that market decision equal to market

1024
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:32,160
demand and that gives you

1025
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:35,520
an optimal market supply and market

1026
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,240
price okay and you that market supply

1027
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,119
implies that each firm must be producing

1028
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,319
three well it turns out at that price

1029
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,160
each firm is producing three so you're

1030
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:45,280
at an equilibrium where everybody's

1031
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,400
satisfied consumers are satisfied

1032
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,720
because the demands being met consumers

1033
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,920
margin willingness to pay is 48 minus P

1034
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,319
well the price is

1035
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,880
18 I'm so the price is 30 so they want

1036
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:57,720
18 that's what they get firms are

1037
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,760
satisfied because aggre get supply is

1038
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,240
35ths p and each individual firm is

1039
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,319
satisfied because price equals marginal

1040
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:10,280
cost we're done that's the magic of the

1041
00:45:05,319 --> 00:45:12,480
market okay and this is the beauty of

1042
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,520
being at MIT and teaching you what is

1043
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,040
usually taught intermediate

1044
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,359
microeconomics at most universities

1045
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,920
you'll never find instruct economics

1046
00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:20,720
course that does this okay which is this

1047
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,960
is the magic of bringing mathematics to

1048
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,920
economics before Paul Samuelson taught

1049
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,599
this class people would teach the graph

1050
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,440
and be done with it okay okay and what

1051
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,200
we've done is we' said you guys want the

1052
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,400
math I've giving you the math I have

1053
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,280
never ever gotten a complaint in this

1054
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,920
course that I do too much math I only

1055
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,400
get complaints I do two little math

1056
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,920
which is unbeli unique I can't imagine

1057
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,280
any other university in the world where

1058
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,359
the major complaint you get is you do

1059
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,720
two little math okay so I want to

1060
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:47,440
explicitly write out here the math

1061
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,720
because I think this is a helpful way to

1062
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,960
understand it but you should have the

1063
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,680
intuition the graphics and the math okay

1064
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:58,440
questions about that

1065
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:00,160
yeah the three- fifth p is the aggregate

1066
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,920
quantity I assume there's six identical

1067
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:07,040
firms each firm I said was producing 10

1068
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:11,359
over P so six time 10 over p is 35th

1069
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:14,680
P good clarifying question

1070
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:17,119
yeah qar equals 18 well I solved here I

1071
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:20,760
had two equations and two unknown one is

1072
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:24,280
the demand curve Q = 48 minus P the

1073
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:26,960
other supply curve Q equals 35ths P so

1074
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:30,079
set 48- P equal to 35ths p and I get qar

1075
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,079
equ 18 and P star equals

1076
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:33,680
30 other questions these are great

1077
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,160
clarifying questions remember if you're

1078
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,319
confused most of the class is confused

1079
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,280
you're you're you're representative of

1080
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:42,000
the class so please ask those questions

1081
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,000
other questions

1082
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,319
yeah well you sol it's two equations two

1083
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,640
unknown you're solving for both right so

1084
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,520
it's a two equation we have two

1085
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,000
equations Q equals 3 fths p and = 48

1086
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,720
minus P You're solving for two unknowns

1087
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,200
two equations and two

1088
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:00,200
unknowns okay okay

1089
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,440
yeah the supply curve all you need is

1090
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,079
the firm's production

1091
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,280
function input prices and the initial

1092
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,040
level of capital and the rest is math

1093
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,319
you've done and should keep doing if

1094
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:17,520
you're not sure about

1095
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:20,880
it great questions okay let's stop there

1096
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,319
