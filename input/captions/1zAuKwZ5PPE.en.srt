1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,400
so basically uh we proved that

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,760
essentially if you follow the steps we

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,880
followed so far in the course and derive

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,359
the perfectly competitive outcome uh

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,480
equilibrium outcome that's the best you

6
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,359
can

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:31,119
do now the best way to understand this

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,879
example is to ask how it gets messed up

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,040
by by government

10
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:38,120
interventions in this world of perfectly

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,120
competitive markets The Government Can

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,160
Only screw things up okay the market

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,360
knows best The Government Can Only screw

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,000
things up and so I going to talk about a

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,680
couple examples of ways the government

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
could screw this market up before coming

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,079
back in a few lecture telling you why

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,559
the government isn't always the bad guy

19
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,800
but but thus far it is okay so for

20
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,160
example let's go back to our market for

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,960
gas and let's look at figure 101

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,960
imagine you're initially in equilibrium

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,799
the market for gas at P1

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,799
q1 Point E1 is equilibrium everybody's

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,439
Happy on the demand and supply

26
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,280
curve and as I proved last time that's

27
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,119
the welfare maximizing outcome that's

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,799
the outcome that maximizes the sum of

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,320
producer and consumer

30
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,960
surpluses now imagine there's a war in

31
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,600
the Middle East as we unfortunately are

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,600
about to are having uh and that raises

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,400
as it will raise the price of gas the

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,200
price of gas is rising in the US it will

35
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,799
rise now because of these terrible

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,200
events uh the Middle East um and that

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,920
results in a higher cost of getting oil

38
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,680
that shifts up the supply curve and that

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,240
leads to a higher price for gasoline so

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,320
we went these Dynamics last time how

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,520
that would happen uh and you move from

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,240
E1 to

43
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,600
E2 now what does that do to

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,039
welfare positively we know what it does

45
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,280
we've derived that what about nor

46
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:05,439
atively what's due to welfare well

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:10,399
before this Supply shift consumer

48
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,599
surplus was a plus b plus d plus e so

49
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,200
before so we're talking about now

50
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,360
government

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,519
interventions so let's say this's Supply

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,519
shift so consumer surplus before the

53
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,920
price

54
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:27,360
rise before the

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:31,280
war the consumer surplus was a plus b

56
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,599
plus d plus e and the producer Surplus

57
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:40,280
equal consumer surplus and the producer

58
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:43,519
Surplus was C+ f plus

59
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,120
G what has happened now well the new

60
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,080
equilibrium

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,920
E2 consumer surplus has fallen to just

62
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,879
a we've lost that entire trapezoid B

63
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,400
plus d plus

64
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:02,680
e producer

65
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,760
Surplus has um producers have gained the

66
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,799
area B Because prices are higher but

67
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,440
they've lost but producers have lost um

68
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:16,799
uh f plus G so producer Surplus has lost

69
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:25,200
f plus G but they've gained

70
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:30,480
B okay so overall Society has lost um uh

71
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,480
Society has uh lost D plus e plus f plus

72
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,840
G that entire sort of if you will sort

73
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,360
of sideways trapezoid

74
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,560
fdeg is gone it's

75
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,959
disappeared uh because now the price is

76
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,480
higher okay and that's our welfare

77
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,840
analysis and right now we're talking

78
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,040
about good bad we're not talking about

79
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,400
how we feel about this we're just saying

80
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,799
what happened positively what happened

81
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,280
positively is welfare fell by that

82
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,920
trapezoid

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,799
fdeg now however imagine that voters are

84
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,200
said about this President Biden's up for

85
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,599
re-election in a little bit more than a

86
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,480
year he may be worried that higher gas

87
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,879
prices will hurt his chances as they

88
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,200
often uh people terms out people's in

89
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,280
feelings about inflation are heavily

90
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,040
shaped by what happens at the gas prices

91
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,720
and he says you know what we ought to do

92
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,040
we ought to limit this price rise in gas

93
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,840
why don't we just tell the gas producers

94
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,240
that they can't raise their

95
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,039
prices why don't we set a price ceiling

96
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,160
at P1 and just say look price of gas was

97
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,880
I don't know 350 50 before these latest

98
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,080
events 360 you can't raise it it's got

99
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,560
to say 360 a gallon you can't raise to 4

100
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,520
450 whatever it's going to go to and

101
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,560
then the voters will be happy because

102
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,240
they won have to pay more for

103
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,120
gas okay well what would that do we can

104
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,440
show that in figure

105
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,039
101 little in figure 102 little

106
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,400
two so what is the effect of price seing

107
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,520
let's walk through this slowly first

108
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,039
thing is they said a price sailing at P1

109
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,880
suppos it's a price cealing set at P1

110
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,280
first question is at a price cealing of

111
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,320
P1 how much gas gets produced and why

112
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,639
someone tell me at a price sealing of P1

113
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,240
if the government says the price can't

114
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,000
go above P1 how much gas gets produced

115
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,479
in

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,600
why what quantity of gas is produced in

117
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,600
the

118
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,600
market and

119
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,759
why yeah

120
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,639
you got to speak

121
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,360
up a lower specifically what quantity

122
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,080
lower quantity what Q3 is produced and

123
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,080
why is Q3

124
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,440
produced yeah basically because in this

125
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,919
situation of dise

126
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,960
equilibrium where at that price Supply

127
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,360
does not equal

128
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,520
demand firms are in charge you've

129
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,000
basically said look we are going to

130
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,440
assist the price above p is P1 consumers

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,840
are like super we want to continue

132
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,960
consuming q1 and firms say no we're not

133
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,599
interested in producing q1 we're going

134
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,319
to produce Q3 and that's all we're going

135
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,759
to produce that's all you get it doesn't

136
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,720
matter the consumers want q1 so we're

137
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,520
out of equilibrium we have excess demand

138
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,160
but unlike the case last time with an

139
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,319
excess demand led the equilibrium to

140
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,360
adjust it can't this time because the

141
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:26,440
government set a price cealing so now

142
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,199
the new equilibrium is at E3 with only

143
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,160
Q3 being

144
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,479
sold so the key point is when you're out

145
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,880
of

146
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,360
equilibrium you've got to look

147
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,639
at who is the constrained party who's

148
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,479
going to determine what happens well

149
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,840
basically it's going to be whichever

150
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,000
party wants to produce or consume less

151
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,120
it doesn't matter how much consumers

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,280
want to consume producers only produce

153
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,919
Q3 okay so only Q3 gets produced and we

154
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,879
knew equilibrate

155
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,280
E3 well what does this do well there are

156
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,039
two

157
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:06,240
costs and one

158
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,960
benefit okay the cost the first cost so

159
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,080
what so the government intervenes

160
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:14,319
there's two

161
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,319
costs the first cost is an efficiency

162
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,360
reduction is an efficiency

163
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,319
reduction what is the efficiency

164
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,520
reduction well let's

165
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:29,840
return so if you look at this

166
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,080
diagram in the disequilibrium outcome

167
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:37,039
only E3 gets

168
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:39,280
produced okay so what is the new only so

169
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,800
only Q3 amounts of gas are

170
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,240
produced this I'm comparing compare

171
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,840
equilibrium E3 to equilibrium E2 now

172
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,960
remember on the previous diagram the

173
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,479
bottom of the previous page we talked

174
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,319
about E2 was worse than E1 but that's

175
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,240
done the war has

176
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,360
happened we're now at E2 if the

177
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,199
government doesn't do anything so now

178
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,560
the relev comparison is not to E1 E1

179
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:02,720
doesn't exist anymore it's E3 to E2 so

180
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,560
want to ask what happens to Total social

181
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,960
welfare we moveed from E2 to E3 well the

182
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,680
answer is that

183
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:17,400
consumers only get Q3 amount of gas at a

184
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,720
price of P1 so consumer

185
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,039
surplus has gone so consumer surplus

186
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,080
without the government intervention at

187
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:30,159
this new price would be at this new

188
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:33,919
price without government so at each two

189
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:37,399
consumer surplus would be v+ Y at

190
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:43,240
E2 okay and producer Surplus at

191
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:45,320
E2 would be uh W plus Z Plus

192
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,760
X at

193
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,920
E2 okay now we move to

194
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,839
E3 what is the new consumer

195
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,120
surplus can anyone tell them what the

196
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,120
new consumer surplus is at

197
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:05,040
E3 yeah V plus W excellent because it's

198
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,640
the area under the demand curve above

199
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,480
the price line but only for units sold

200
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,360
it doesn't matter that the area Y and

201
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,200
the area Z is still under the demand

202
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,760
curve above the price line that's

203
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,079
irrelevant because the units aren't sold

204
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,360
you can't derive surplus of something

205
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:24,920
you don't

206
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:29,640
buy so consumer surplus is now V plus W

207
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,120
so consumers lose Y and they gain w

208
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,680
but what about producers same person

209
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,560
what's the new producer

210
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:43,720
Surplus X producers have lost w and

211
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:47,640
z so what has happened W has been

212
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:51,320
transferred from producers to

213
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,880
Consumers consumers are gaining W

214
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,240
because they're now paying lower prices

215
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:00,040
for

216
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:01,920
gas but y+ Z is lost y Plus plus Z is

217
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,360
what we call dead weight loss remember

218
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,680
from last time what's happened to y+ Z

219
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,600
they are trades that would make both

220
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,600
parties better off that are not allowed

221
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,760
to happen look if you stay at

222
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,920
E2 both producers and consumers would be

223
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:23,120
happy to sell all the gallons of gas

224
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:26,560
between Q2 and Q3 but you're not letting

225
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,640
them therefore you're reducing welfare

226
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,200
you're reducing the total social welfare

227
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,839
by not allowing those trades to

228
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,360
happen Okay so that is the first cost

229
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,839
this government intervention trades that

230
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,839
don't get made lead to an efficiency

231
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:43,680
loss trades that would make both parties

232
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,000
better

233
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,399
off but that don't get made lead to an

234
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,959
efficiency loss okay there shouldn't

235
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,800
this radical

236
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:57,920
idea if you've got your your two you

237
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,040
know uh your two uh playing cards you

238
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,240
like and your friend is two playing

239
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,720
cards they like and you'd be happy to

240
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,200
have your friend's card and they'd be

241
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,360
happy to have yours but your mom's upset

242
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,120
with you and won't let you make the

243
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,120
trade you're worse

244
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,079
off okay you're worse off if you can't

245
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,680
make trades that make you that make both

246
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,959
parties happier that's a simple

247
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,079
intuition Society has lost and what have

248
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:22,720
they lost they've lost this deadweight

249
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:26,079
loss amount y plus Z questions about

250
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,560
that but that's not the only cost

251
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,240
there's a second cost which is

252
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,240
allocation

253
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,240
inefficiency and this is a new idea but

254
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,639
it's really following from the intuition

255
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,680
we've already developed in this

256
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:47,680
class which is that in a world of

257
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,320
equilibrium we never have to

258
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,440
ask who gets the good and how much they

259
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,680
value it and who doesn't get the good

260
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,079
and how much they value it we know from

261
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,160
the diagram so if you look at figure 102

262
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,800
without the price

263
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,959
ceiling basically we we know who gets

264
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,360
the gas everyone who values it at above

265
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,200
P2 we know who doesn't get the gas

266
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,880
everyone blows it below P2 you're

267
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,680
done but now look at the new out of

268
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:18,360
equilibrium outcome

269
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:21,920
E3 you have Q3 units of q1 units of gas

270
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:25,120
people want but only Q3 that's provided

271
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,160
so what determines who gets it it used

272
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
to be you didn't have to worry about

273
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,360
that the price determined it people who

274
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,440
want it above the price got it didn't

275
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,040
want to place didn't get it but now

276
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,680
you've got more people who want it at

277
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,240
that price that is actually supplied so

278
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,279
you've got a new question who gets it

279
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,800
and the problem is answering that

280
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,920
question creates a new

281
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,279
inefficiency because it's inefficient

282
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:50,160
having to figure out how to allocate the

283
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:51,639
good okay so for example in the 1970s we

284
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,800
put in a gas price ceiling there was a

285
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,680
gas price shock due to the formation of

286
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,839
the organization of petroleum exporting

287
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,800
countries or

288
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,320
OPEC the uh countries in World got

289
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,480
together and formed a cartel we'll talk

290
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,959
about all this in a couple lectures

291
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,680
formed a cartel and that cartel reduced

292
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,199
the amount of oil being sold raising the

293
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,800
price of gas the US government was upset

294
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:15,920
gas had been cheap forever so they put

295
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,720
in a gas price ceiling what happened

296
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,040
well what happened was more people

297
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,320
wanted gas at that low price than the

298
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:26,360
gas stations willing to sell so what

299
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,320
resulted was giant lines of cars with at

300
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,120
gas station huge snaky lines of cars you

301
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,920
could wait 15 20 minutes in a line or

302
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,160
longer to get your gas why because it

303
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,199
was only Q3 amount of gas and q1 people

304
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,760
wanted it so the only way to allocate it

305
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:42,199
was to wait in line well that waiting in

306
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,360
line is

307
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:47,000
inefficient why is it inefficient that

308
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,720
people waiting in line for

309
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,160
gas what's the efficiency cost

310
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,240
yeah the opportunity cost they could be

311
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,600
doing something else clearly that is not

312
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,440
the use of their time that makes them

313
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,880
happiest I highly doubt there was anyone

314
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,519
who said woohoo I want to go wait in the

315
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,120
line for gas okay they could have been

316
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,279
working they could have been having fun

317
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,480
whatever they could have been doing it

318
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,360
would have been better than waiting line

319
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,600
for

320
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,000
gas there's also a second order in

321
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,240
efficiency cost second order means small

322
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,079
which is they're using up a lot of gas

323
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,440
waiting in line for gas remember we had

324
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,240
big gas guzzlers then that got like

325
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,720
eight miles to the gallon so you could

326
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,639
use up probably a gallon of gas waiting

327
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,320
to get your gas sitting in line idling

328
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,480
okay but that's the technical point the

329
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,399
main point is there was a huge

330
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,639
opportunity cost that opportunity cost

331
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,279
is inefficiency

332
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,680
that is destroyed social surplus social

333
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:37,759
welfare that is happiness that could

334
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:40,199
have been derived working or in Leisure

335
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,920
that's gone so that's an additional

336
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:45,240
inefficiency that comes from this kind

337
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,120
of government intervention not only is

338
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,279
there inefficient amount of gas produced

339
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,360
you're destroying efficiency further

340
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,680
through the mechanism that allocates the

341
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,519
gas why doesn't that happen in a

342
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,560
competitive equilibrium because the

343
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,639
mechanism is the price you look at the

344
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,160
price you either get if you want or you

345
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,519
don't if you don't don't it's easy you

346
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,959
drive by the gas station if you want it

347
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,720
you pull in you get the gas if you don't

348
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,600
want it you drive by now if you want it

349
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,040
you got to wait in line because there's

350
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,800
not enough to satisfy the demand so that

351
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,279
government intervention has caused a new

352
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,240
efficiency loss the opportunity cost of

353
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:20,000
people waiting in line for

354
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,720
gas Okay now what's the

355
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,279
benefit the

356
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,600
benefit of all this

357
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,600
presumably is

358
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:33,319
equity presum the government's decided

359
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:36,319
that they care about

360
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:37,800
consumers more than producers you can

361
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:39,920
call it Equity you can call political

362
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,560
calculation whatever you want but the

363
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,000
idea is the benefits government say well

364
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,920
yeah you got all efficiency but look we

365
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
got to transfer W from those awful oil

366
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,319
companies to these wonderful consumers

367
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,959
who happen to

368
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:55,480
vote okay and isn't that a good benefit

369
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,279
and the answer is well maybe and what

370
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,399
we've learned so far it's not what we've

371
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:02,680
learned so far social welfare is just a

372
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,880
sum of produc or consumer surplus so

373
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,240
transfers do not affect social welfare

374
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,399
okay that's the key in our framework so

375
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,880
far we defined welfare as simply

376
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,120
consumer surplus plus producer

377
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,639
Surplus then transferring from one part

378
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,240
to the other doesn't help that's just

379
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,759
inefficiency but voters and politicians

380
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,720
may not feel that way and maybe we

381
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:28,040
shouldn't NE this raises the really

382
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,560
interesting question that we will come

383
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,800
back to

384
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,560
about the fact that in reality we might

385
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:38,160
not be indifferent between these two in

386
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,800
reality we might be willing to have a

387
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,319
little inefficiency to get Goods in the

388
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,000
hands of people who we think deserve

389
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:46,199
them

390
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:49,079
more in other words in reality we may be

391
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:51,319
willing to sacrifice some efficiency for

392
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:53,519
equity and that is the heart of what we

393
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:55,560
call the equity efficiency tradeoff that

394
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,000
we'll discuss later the

395
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,319
semester so in reality we might be able

396
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,519
to make this trade but from what you've

397
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:03,399
learned in this class so far we're not

398
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,480
with this definition of social welfare

399
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,760
we are not willing to make this

400
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,679
trade okay and this is a fundamental

401
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,439
doand uh Concept in economics now let's

402
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,959
question about

403
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:17,480
this let's go through some real world

404
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,319
examples let's talk about ticket

405
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,640
scalping okay a few years ago Adele went

406
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,319
on tour for the first time in four years

407
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,640
to back up an incredibly successful

408
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,000
album and folks there was huge pend up

409
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,480
demand to see her live

410
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,240
she said look I want to make sure my

411
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,840
fans can see me so I'm G to price the

412
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,799
tickets affordably tickets are going to

413
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,520
be start at $40 and no ticket we more

414
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:39,080
than

415
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,559
$150 which is unbelievably cheap for

416
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,280
major concerts these days okay she said

417
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,400
look I know my fans willing to pay

418
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,200
thousands of dollars to see me so I want

419
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,880
to give them some Surplus I'm not going

420
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,200
to pay more can pay more than 150 or

421
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,360
even 40 if they want to sit in the cheap

422
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,400
seats okay but did the fans get that

423
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,320
Surplus no what happened was as soon as

424
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,200
the tickets went on sale they were all

425
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,039
immediately bought by

426
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,159
scalpers scalpers are basically

427
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,400
secondary ticket sellers who set up Bots

428
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:12,080
to instantly buy all tickets available

429
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,559
if they feel that they're below if

430
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,120
they're priced below market value they

431
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:19,760
then resell them through places like

432
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,559
stubhub.com and other places at the

433
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,480
actual market value so what happened was

434
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,000
the price forell ticket was actually not

435
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,600
sure if you got on and managed to beat

436
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,919
the Bots you got it for 150 but if you

437
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,080
did in went tub Hub was

438
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:35,080
$1,500 okay which is because that's what

439
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,760
people willing to pay to go see Adele

440
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,039
then we started on Taylor

441
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,880
Swift okay Taylor's tickets were priced

442
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,919
between $50 and

443
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,679
$500 okay they actually um the uh the

444
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,919
tickets are now sold between $800 and

445
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,960
$111,000 to go see Taylor Swift because

446
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,280
that's what people are willing to pay so

447
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,080
everyone's like oh Taylor Swift set her

448
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,400
tickets $500 that was too cheap that was

449
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,320
cheaper than the what the market wanted

450
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,360
the market was willing to pay much more

451
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,640
now it didn't have to be this way when I

452
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,280
was a kid scalping was illegal and there

453
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,320
was no online market so the way you get

454
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,799
to like go to Shady guys in raincoats

455
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,559
outside the stadium and like buy the

456
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,320
tickets from them okay that's the way it

457
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,400
used to work so really if you wanted

458
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,640
tickets there's no online Market what

459
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,159
did you do you waited

460
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,760
online so literally we'd stay up all

461
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,799
night if a big band was touring we'd

462
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,960
camp out the night before and stay up

463
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,280
all night waiting online to be able to

464
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,320
get a ticket the next day that's how

465
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,320
they were allocated there's no more

466
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:38,080
lines because now we do it by

467
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,720
Price which system is better well in

468
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,559
fact the system when I was a kid was

469
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,159
much less

470
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:48,840
efficient why because basically the

471
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:50,320
people the time we wasted online had a

472
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,400
high opportunity cost now we can just

473
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,480
pay in some sense essentially what the

474
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,919
secondary online Market does has

475
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,679
reintroduced efficiency to the

476
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,039
allocation of tickets now people pay

477
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,799
what they're

478
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,400
worth okay so in some sense the good

479
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:09,440
news is the market today is much more

480
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,679
efficient for allocating tickets than

481
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,600
was the market when I was a kid because

482
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,360
we don't waste time sleeping in the cold

483
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:19,440
waiting

484
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:21,919
online okay okay however it's not say as

485
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,440
Equitable because

486
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:28,880
now who gets the money well we when we

487
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,360
slept online who got the Surplus well

488
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,440
the consumer got the

489
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,000
Surplus presumably those of us who are

490
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,559
willing to sleep online could get

491
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,240
tickets for less than our Surplus if

492
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,440
than our I if if the value US of seeing

493
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,120
the show plus the disutility of sleeping

494
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,200
online

495
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,720
exceeded I'm sorry if the value seeing

496
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,840
the show minus the disutility of

497
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,960
sleeping online exceeded the ticket

498
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:58,159
price we wouldn't sleep

499
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,159
online so we got the Surplus now the

500
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,600
Surplus largely goes to secondary ticket

501
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,039
sellers it still goes to Consumers

502
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,159
people don't buy unless they get some

503
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,919
Surplus but who's not getting the

504
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,640
Surplus is

505
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,159
performers so even Taylor Swift is

506
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,240
making way even though she is now

507
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,559
setting the all-time record for a tour

508
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,600
the pr record was Elton John at1

509
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,640
billion Elton John to be clear has been

510
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,400
making music for 50 years Taylor Swift

511
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,440
is only 33 years old he now going to

512
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,279
break the record at $1.5 billion and

513
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,640
that is way under what her tour should

514
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,840
make okay way under what a tour should

515
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,840
make cuz she is not selling tickets the

516
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,679
price people willing to pay for

517
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,720
them okay so which system is better well

518
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,640
it's hard to

519
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,000
say on the one hand tickets today get

520
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,320
allocated to those who value them the

521
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,120
most according to

522
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,200
price on the other hand all that extra

523
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,400
money goes to

524
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:59,120
scalpers what could Adele or Taylor

525
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:01,520
Swift do to address this point

526
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,039
what could they do to at least make sure

527
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,360
that they got the money rather than

528
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:08,480
scalpers getting the money

529
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,960
yeah I'm

530
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,720
sorry well basically it's sort of hard

531
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,240
to know what the G price is but they

532
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,159
could for example set up an auction why

533
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,440
couldn't Taylor Swift say I'm playing

534
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,440
Boston I'm gonna put my tickets up for

535
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,600
auction people can

536
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,600
bid and it'll be like

537
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,000
eBay I'll just sell my tickets the

538
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,760
highest bidder you would end up with

539
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,559
exactly the same outcomes you get from

540
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,960
the secondary Market but all the money

541
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:36,679
would go to Taylor Swift instead of

542
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,919
going to these Shady StubHub

543
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:42,919
guys

544
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:45,320
okay why don't performers do

545
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,760
this the answer is I'm pretty sure

546
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,279
public relations there's no reason why

547
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,279
they couldn't Taylor Swift there's no

548
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:50,720
reason Taylor Swift couldn't hire an

549
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,919
infinite number of programmers set up an

550
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,360
online auction to make this work the

551
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,159
answer is essentially public relations

552
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,000
that basically artists feel they're

553
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:02,080
making plenty of money and they they

554
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,320
look pretty bad if they were charging

555
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,320
these incredible prices which is what

556
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,760
they get from these auctions which is

557
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,960
sort of too bad because people are

558
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,279
paying those prices anyway but sub sense

559
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,360
because they're hidden through paying at

560
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:15,799
StubHub Taylor Swift doesn't get as a

561
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,880
hard of time if she set up an auction

562
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:21,200
sold tickets for 2,000 or eight $1,000

563
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,480
each but that's sort of unfortunate

564
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,559
because it's really the same outcome

565
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,640
it's just who gets the money Taylor

566
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:27,640
Swift should get the money it's her show

567
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,799
she's the one adding value to society by

568
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,760
doing a three and a half our show not

569
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:36,960
these scalpers she should get the money

570
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:38,240
so the bottom line is there are ways the

571
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,159
bottom line lesson from this ticket

572
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,120
scalping example is

573
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,159
a we can see an example of shifting from

574
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,480
an inefficient allocation mechanism

575
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,200
which is waiting online to an efficient

576
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,240
allocation mechanism which is using

577
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,200
price but that shift did not necess

578
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,640
deliver the Surplus the folks we want to

579
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,960
deliver it to it delivered it to a third

580
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,640
set of actors who set up this Online

581
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,000
Marketplace

582
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,000
okay questions about

583
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:10,600
that okay now let's go to a much more

584
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,880
complicated example but one which really

585
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,200
lays out clearly how to think about

586
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,360
these tradeoffs which is the case of

587
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,360
taxi cab

588
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,279
medallions cast your mind back 20 years

589
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,360
ago okay notably before Uber and lft and

590
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,600
all these

591
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,760
things in that world if you wanted to

592
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,399
get from point A to point B and didn't

593
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,039
have a car you took a

594
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:37,600
taxi now taxis should be a textbook

595
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,000
example of a perfectly competitive

596
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,360
market right to be a tax driver you just

597
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,279
need a car and that's it pretty low

598
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,919
fixed cost when people have cars

599
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:48,640
anyway it should be a very very

600
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,159
perfectly competitive

601
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,279
market but in fact it was

602
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,520
not it was a market that was not

603
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,159
perfectly competitive because it was

604
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:01,000
heavily regulated by

605
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:05,279
cities and in particular what cities

606
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,039
did is they limited the amount of taxes

607
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,200
to those who held essentially

608
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,679
certificates that made them legal taxi

609
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,600
drivers they were called medallions

610
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,600
because they're originally medallions

611
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,760
but not a pieces of paper essentially

612
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,320
cities issued pieces of paper that said

613
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,240
you're an official taxi driver and only

614
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,960
if you had one of these could you drive

615
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,440
a

616
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,799
taxi okay what we want to do is analyze

617
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,000
what are the welfare implications of

618
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,440
these limited number of of taxi cab

619
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,760
medallions so let's go to figure 103

620
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,360
which is one of the more complicated

621
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,080
figures you'll see in this class okay

622
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,440
it's one of these back and forth figures

623
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,840
bear with me but please interrupt me if

624
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,120
there's

625
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:47,919
questions okay so imagine that

626
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,120
initially we had no taxi cab medallions

627
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,919
in a free taxi cab Market in such a

628
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,399
market let's start in the part diagram

629
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:59,000
on the left of figure 103 in such a

630
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:01,200
market price would equal marginal cost

631
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,799
would equal minimum average cost we' be

632
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,720
an equilibrium point little

633
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:10,520
E1 price would be P1 why we'd have

634
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,320
identical taxi cabs produce identical

635
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:16,279
Market it' be easily shopping be perfect

636
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,640
competition and weend up with price P1

637
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:21,200
at Price

638
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:24,799
P1 we would have at Price P1 each of the

639
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:27,200
identical cabs would produce little q1

640
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,320
rides okay because each cab and once

641
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,039
again let's assume to make life easy I'm

642
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,039
going to assume identical

643
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,320
cabs this is an assumption but not too

644
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,720
bad in this case much better assumption

645
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,120
than say assuming identical factories

646
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,559
the idea that cabs are kind of identical

647
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:47,960
is not implausible so assume identical

648
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:51,480
cabs they all have minimum average cost

649
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:54,279
at the point q1 little q1 on the le-

650
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,399
hand side diagram so a series of

651
00:26:54,279 --> 00:27:00,880
identical cabs all of them have minimum

652
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:03,960
average cost at amount little q1 and

653
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,520
therefore set price equal to P1 now go

654
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:10,720
over to the right hand diagram we have a

655
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:13,440
demand curve there with a price of P1

656
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,600
that means that a total of big q1 rides

657
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,960
will be

658
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,120
demanded well if big q1 rides are

659
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,760
demanded and each firm is going to

660
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,200
produce little q1 rides that pins down

661
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,600
the number of

662
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,120
firms N1 okay once again go through the

663
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,039
logic and stop me if it's in clear we

664
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,559
know each FM will produce little

665
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:38,679
q1 we know at that price big q1 rise or

666
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,039
demanded therefore we could Define the

667
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:43,240
number of firms as big q1 over little q1

668
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:47,320
which is

669
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:51,360
N1 so there's N1 firms providing little

670
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:55,080
q1 rides each at a price of P1 in the

671
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,440
free market questions about

672
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,360
that once again as we learned a couple

673
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,600
lectures ago we know we end up there

674
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,240
because if there was less than little N1

675
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,799
firms the price would be higher there'd

676
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,720
be profits being made and new firms

677
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:09,200
would enter okay and you could just

678
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,200
should be able to show yourself that

679
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,559
they're less than the Len one firms you

680
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,399
could see the quantity be lower at a

681
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,519
lower quantity price would be higher

682
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:19,120
you'd move up the demand curve and

683
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,480
therefore profits would be being made

684
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,919
and therefore firms would enter and

685
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,840
there's not a lot of barriers to entry

686
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,799
here so this is not a bad example for a

687
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,679
competitive

688
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:33,279
market okay now let's say the government

689
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:36,360
comes in and says

690
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,039
um you know what we're only going to

691
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,760
allow there to

692
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:45,279
be we are only going to be allowed there

693
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,640
to be little end two numbers of cabs so

694
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,600
the government comes in the government

695
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:51,919
restriction here is in the form not of

696
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,200
price but of number of

697
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,120
firms the government says only N2 cabs

698
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,760
will be allowed this is a new kind of

699
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,480
restriction we haven't done this before

700
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,519
we talked about gas price

701
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,200
ceiling okay that was a price

702
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:05,440
restriction this is now a number of

703
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,840
firms

704
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,519
restriction government says only N2 Cals

705
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:15,080
will be

706
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:18,960
allowed okay now what happens there well

707
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,760
up to N2 if you look at the right hand

708
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,919
side

709
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,440
diagram up to the first dash line which

710
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:30,919
is little N2 little q1 nothing has

711
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:34,640
changed if the demain curve was such

712
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:37,919
that that big Q was less than little N2

713
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,720
little q1 nothing would have

714
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,600
changed but what happens once we get

715
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,480
past that first point little N2 little

716
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,799
q1 what happens is that now each cab has

717
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,240
to produce more rides because you can't

718
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:55,039
add new cab

719
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,399
companies each cab can no longer produce

720
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,000
at the efficient

721
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:01,360
Point each cab company can no longer

722
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,399
ride q1 rides why because it won't meet

723
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,039
demand and new firms can't enter so to

724
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,200
meet demand cabs need to drive more well

725
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:11,760
if they're going to drive more they're

726
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,039
no longer going to be efficient q1's the

727
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,039
efficient amount in other words think of

728
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,279
it this way q1 is the point in which

729
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,440
drivers are maximally efficient driving

730
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,600
once they have to drive more maybe

731
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,880
they're more tired maybe they have to

732
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,519
drive at hours that aren't as convenient

733
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,279
for them they're less efficient in

734
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,200
producing rides think of cab drivers

735
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,640
like a firm they have a perfectly

736
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,799
efficient amount of r to give once you

737
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,159
have them give more they're less

738
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:35,600
efficient maybe because they're more

739
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:37,559
tired well if they're less efficient

740
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,519
that means they are providing them at a

741
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:45,320
higher cost so the new supply curve is

742
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:48,320
flat until N2 q1 but the new supply

743
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,480
curve S2 is no longer a line S no longer

744
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,399
S1 which is a horizontal line the new

745
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,600
supply curve S2 is horizontal till that

746
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:58,000
first intersection and then becomes

747
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,720
upward sloping the new supply curve S2

748
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,080
has that horizontal segment that becomes

749
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,200
upward sloping and once again these kind

750
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,159
of Kink curves are hard let's explain

751
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,399
why the reason why it's flat is because

752
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:12,720
as long as there's less than q1 rides

753
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:15,840
per firm they produce at maximum

754
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,880
efficiency but once you ask any taxi

755
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,760
driver to work more than little q1

756
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,399
rides it's

757
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,200
inefficient okay you can see this by now

758
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:30,360
turning to the leftand side

759
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:32,480
diagram you see that to produce Q2

760
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,600
rides they do

761
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:39,039
so at a much

762
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,440
higher point at a much higher Point than

763
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:42,559
marginal cost

764
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,080
curve so if they're going to set

765
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:48,240
marginal cost equal to

766
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:50,600
price okay they are going to say so now

767
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,279
go back to the right hand side so with

768
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,279
this new supply curve okay question

769
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,679
about supply curve looks like it does

770
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:59,679
once again this is hard so please let me

771
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:01,679
know if there's questions about that

772
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:05,519
okay so with this new supply curve that

773
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,519
hits demand at a new higher price

774
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,480
P2

775
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,480
yeah

776
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:16,320
yeah it's flat to the left of that flat

777
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,120
part because as long if imagine demand

778
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,039
was shifted way inwards and demand was

779
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,039
less than little N2 little

780
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:26,039
q1 even if you restricted number of

781
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,600
firms each firm would still provide q1

782
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:31,880
rides the point is you're only allowing

783
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,440
up to n two firms let's say that demand

784
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,200
intersected that line so I I'm doing the

785
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,600
risky thing of drawing a diagram here

786
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,279
okay so you've got this demand curve

787
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,960
here right and you've got this supply

788
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:44,480
curve that looks like this and then

789
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,600
looks like this imag demand curve came

790
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:51,159
here and let's call this intersection

791
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,360
little N3 q1 well the these firm will

792
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:54,320
continue to prod that their efficient

793
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,760
level you just have a smaller number of

794
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,480
firms there'd be no reason to produce in

795
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,080
efficiently but the problem is once you

796
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,320
get past P this point more firms can't

797
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,399
enter what keeps this original supply

798
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,760
curve S1 flat is entry of firms but

799
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:08,799
firms can't enter past this point the

800
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,840
existing firms have to produce more and

801
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,720
they do so

802
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,000
inefficiently so this is the efficient

803
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,360
part of production for q1 firms for N1

804
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,840
firms I'm sorry the efficient production

805
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,760
for N2 firms but for N2 firms once you

806
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,760
get past here they have to be more tired

807
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:28,440
and produce less efficiently okay other

808
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,279
questions okay so the new price is P2

809
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,159
when now let's go back to the left at a

810
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:33,799
price P2 said equal the marginal cost

811
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,600
ignore the ac2 curve for a minute we'll

812
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:38,519
come back to that stay with

813
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,760
ac1 if we set that new price P2 equal

814
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:45,159
the marginal cost we get equilibrium E2

815
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,480
and a huge amount of profits the profits

816
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:48,880
at that new price P2 marginal cost is

817
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,440
well above average cost once again

818
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,720
ignore ac2 stay with ac1 okay at that

819
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,080
new price

820
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,480
P2 marginal cost is well above average

821
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,840
cost and you get a huge profit of the

822
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,840
amount

823
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:10,119
Pi okay so now they're making

824
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,879
profit now what's happened is by

825
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,560
limiting the number of cabs they are now

826
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:15,919
making profit what is this done to

827
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,599
social welfare well let's go back to the

828
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,679
right hand side what was the old

829
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:21,760
consumer

830
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,320
surplus what was the old consumer

831
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,560
surplus somebody tell me before we put

832
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,480
in this restriction what was the

833
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,119
consumer surplus raise your hand and

834
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,599
tell me

835
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,879
me you guys got this need a little more

836
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,240
confidence out of this class come on you

837
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,119
guys got an M you're Wicked smart go

838
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,520
ahead a plus b plus c c has two parts

839
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,599
it's sort of weird but a plus b plus C A

840
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,919
plus b plus C same person what's the old

841
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:48,679
producer

842
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:48,679
Surplus there's none

843
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,800
why in a perfectly competitive long run

844
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,839
equilibrium there's zero

845
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,440
profits okay we we so because of free

846
00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:02,320
entry in a perfectly competitive log

847
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,200
equilibrium there's no profits so produ

848
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,880
Surplus is zero what is the new same

849
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,680
person what's the new consumer surplus

850
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,880
if we sell a price

851
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:15,760
P2 a what is the new producer

852
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,480
Surplus

853
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:20,240
B so what has happened we have

854
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,119
transferred

855
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,920
B from consumers to producers that's

856
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:29,119
their new

857
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:31,400
profits okay so be and aggregate would

858
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,680
be the sum of the little Pi triangles on

859
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,760
the left over all firms so we took the

860
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,160
profits made on the left multiplied by n

861
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:42,560
two firms that would give you

862
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:44,200
B okay B is the total aggate profits

863
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,599
that is so we've taken money for

864
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,599
consumers give to profits but we've

865
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,960
created a dead weight loss the dead

866
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,040
weight loss is

867
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,040
C so it's an inefficient

868
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,079
restriction okay it's an infinite

869
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,440
restriction now so so we have the

870
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,480
efficiency

871
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,839
loss we also have the allocation now

872
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,200
here we don't have an allocation loss

873
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,160
I'm sorry because we're in

874
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,280
equilibrium so the people willing to pay

875
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,040
for the rides still get the rides we

876
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,079
don't have the allocation issue here

877
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,480
because it's it's we have a new

878
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,400
equilibrium we're not out of equilibrium

879
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,160
in equilibrium which is in equilibrium

880
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,599
with fewer

881
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,560
rides what about Equity well that

882
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,200
depends on how you feel about cab Riders

883
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,960
versus drivers if you think in New York

884
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,480
City all the cab Riders are rich

885
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,440
investment bankers and the cab drivers

886
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,920
are poor immigrants then maybe it's a

887
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,000
good thing maybe it's good we've taken

888
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,680
area B away from the rich investment

889
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
bankers and given it to the cab drivers

890
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,000
if on the other hand you think a lot of

891
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,839
the cab Riders are also poor people need

892
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,079
to get to work it might not be such a

893
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:47,280
good

894
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:48,880
idea but guess what all that is

895
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,040
irrelevant

896
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,119
why because

897
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:59,240
actually there's a market for taxi cab

898
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:01,599
medallions they sell in the market

899
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:04,359
you can sell your taxic cam Medallion

900
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,640
can anyone tell me in this diagram what

901
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:08,839
the market price of a taxi cab medallion

902
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,119
should be if there a perfectly

903
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:14,319
competitive taxi cab medallion

904
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,760
Market what should the total cost of a

905
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:18,000
taxi cab medallion be can anyone take a

906
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:20,839
guess at

907
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,319
that the answer is is a letter is is a

908
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:28,440
letter Greek or Roman on this diagram

909
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:30,920
which tells you yeah Pi Pi

910
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,599
why that's

911
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:37,280
get yeah because if if I want to buy a

912
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:40,760
medallion I'll be willing to pay up to

913
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,400
Pi minus Epsilon to get it why because

914
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,520
as long as I pay Pi minus Epsilon I

915
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,000
still make

916
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,040
profit so perfect competition is not

917
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,359
driven profits to zero through firm

918
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:54,760
entry perfect competition driven profits

919
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:57,640
to Zero by selling the barrier to

920
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,880
entry there's a barrier to entry here

921
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,640
which is a government restriction that

922
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,480
covers the number of firms n two we're

923
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,880
now putting a market on that we're

924
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,200
letting firms buy their way in how much

925
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,480
will they pay they'll pay up to the

926
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,480
profits they'd make by buying their way

927
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,839
in so in

928
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,319
fact who is better off here it's not the

929
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,880
taxi cab

930
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:23,520
drivers they still make zero profit

931
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,040
who's better off it's The Medallion

932
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,640
owners and who are they a bunch of

933
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,880
randos who have happen to get issued the

934
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,599
medallions in 1930 whatever when the

935
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,480
government set up this

936
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:41,119
system taxing medallions are incredibly

937
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:44,119
valuable so for example um um in uh San

938
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,880
Francisco you have to pay 12,000 you had

939
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:47,880
to pay $122,000 a year to rent a taxi

940
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,480
cab

941
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:54,920
medallion in Boston it was

942
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,280
$400,000 to buy taxi money so those taxi

943
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,480
cab drivers who are not rich guys who

944
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,160
are driving you from place to place well

945
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,280
you were kids driving your parents from

946
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,040
place to place okay they're paying

947
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,640
$400,000 just for the right to drive you

948
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,720
around okay and the estimated lost

949
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,599
consumer surplus was about $2 billion

950
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,520
there was about $2 billion in Lost

951
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,640
consumer

952
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,079
surplus partly it was inefficiency and

953
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:21,640
partly was just going to these Medallion

954
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,800
owners okay now why do we have

955
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:27,040
restrictions like this well at one level

956
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,920
it makes sense you don't want any Schmo

957
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,920
d driving around giving people

958
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,240
rides it could be dangerous they could

959
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,280
be a bad driver they could be a criminal

960
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,800
so it makes sense to have some

961
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,640
regulations on this indeed this is an

962
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,240
example of something we call

963
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,599
occupational

964
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,359
licensing which is a set of restrictions

965
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,960
that government's put in place to make

966
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:47,359
sure people who say they're doing X can

967
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,760
legitimately do

968
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,599
X this makes a lot of sense for example

969
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,240
for

970
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:55,760
doctors we don't want a world of Dr

971
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,640
Nicks okay question how many of you are

972
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,319
well vered in The Simpsons

973
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,560
okay this is utterly

974
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:04,599
depressing okay that is the single most

975
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,000
important cultural accomplishment of the

976
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:08,079
America in the last 50 years as The

977
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,640
Simpsons you guys should absolutely be

978
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,880
watching and absorbing that for all the

979
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,560
lessons you need to know about life okay

980
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,000
Dr Nick is the terrible Nick doctor on

981
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,640
The Simpsons okay he's unqualified he

982
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,200
went to Hollywood upstairs medical

983
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,880
school okay he's to totally

984
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,400
unqualified um and uh that's what

985
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,839
happened we have some licensing saying

986
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,400
doctors have to meet certain conditions

987
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,319
have to get recertified we have to

988
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,720
license to drive a car that's not an

989
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:33,119
occupation Etc so the idea is

990
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,599
occupational licensing makes sense to

991
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,400
some

992
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,880
extent but having a random limit on the

993
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,240
number of cab drivers is not the way to

994
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,119
do it you should have some licensing

995
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:47,119
process okay so it's sort of makes

996
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,400
sense okay

997
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,839
now to have some licensing on the other

998
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,400
hand what you're doing is you're

999
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:55,119
essentially taking $2

1000
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,599
billion and giving it to Rich Medallion

1001
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,480
owners however we have good news bad

1002
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:02,520
news for The Medallion King good news

1003
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:06,680
for consumers which is

1004
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:09,119
Uber Uber essentially turned the drive

1005
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,079
Market into a perfectly competitive

1006
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,839
market they said fine if you limit the

1007
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:14,119
number of cabs to N2 we're going to have

1008
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:17,359
a whole set of drivers do the same

1009
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:20,520
things cabs can do with free

1010
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:22,800
entry what happened well what happened

1011
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,680
was taxi drivers and Uber drivers earned

1012
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,680
a little bit less but Medallion owners

1013
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:32,640
got smacked the value tax cap M fell by

1014
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,319
90% why because profits went down

1015
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,040
essentially with free entry we moved

1016
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:39,200
from P2 back towards

1017
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,359
P1 profits fell and therefore they

1018
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,280
couldn't sell medallions for as much so

1019
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,359
yes cab drivers lost a little bit and

1020
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,280
they about Uber but the truth is

1021
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,760
the big losers were Medallion owners who

1022
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,200
were not a sympathetic crowd the big

1023
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:54,800
winners were consumers you have no idea

1024
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,640
how much life you guys are just spoiled

1025
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,200
by life with Uber And We complain about

1026
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,880
it it's got problems but you have no

1027
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,319
idea how much better it is how much

1028
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,720
cheaper is to get from place to place

1029
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:04,480
how much easier is to get from place to

1030
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,520
place than we had these limited numbers

1031
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,760
of

1032
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,800
taxis okay so this a classic example of

1033
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,560
a market

1034
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:15,400
Innovation increasing both Total Surplus

1035
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,800
and consumer surplus total Surplus is

1036
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,680
increased because we moved back towards

1037
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,760
price P1 consumer surplus increased

1038
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,079
because price has

1039
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:24,720
fallen producer Surplus actually isn't

1040
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:25,960
down that much because the producers the

1041
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,920
cab drivers weren't actually making that

1042
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,040
much money anyway the real losers of

1043
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,800
Medallion

1044
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,800
owners okay questions about

1045
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,319
that so this is an example of how we use

1046
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,440
the normative tools of

1047
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:45,319
economics how we use the normative tools

1048
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,520
of Economics to analy these kinds of

1049
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:50,400
interventions let me end with one more

1050
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,440
example which is a really fun one about

1051
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,359
how we can actually use markets to help

1052
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,359
the poor and the example comes from food

1053
00:42:56,359 --> 00:43:00,119
banks food banks organizations that give

1054
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:03,319
away poor food to needy

1055
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:05,160
people feeding America is one of the

1056
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:07,599
largest food banks in the country has

1057
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,839
food banks all over the country and they

1058
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,160
were trying to decide how to send the

1059
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:14,079
right food to the right

1060
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,720
places well the market does this

1061
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,440
naturally places where they want

1062
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,480
hamburgers the price is high there

1063
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,520
hamburgers there the price Falls places

1064
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:23,480
where there's a lot of vegetarians price

1065
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,400
hamburger isn't as high the market does

1066
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,720
that naturally but feeding America it

1067
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,760
wasn't a market-based organization the

1068
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,880
whole idea was to get this food away

1069
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,640
from free for free so they ended up

1070
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,760
doing things like sending potatoes to

1071
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,559
Idaho which is the home of potato

1072
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,240
growing which was pretty

1073
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:39,920
inefficient and they were trying to

1074
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,680
think how can we more efficiently

1075
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,040
allocate the food to the needy so what

1076
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:48,720
they did is they made up a virtual

1077
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,280
Market they said to each Food Bank we're

1078
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,240
giving you a

1079
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,920
budget and we're going to let there be a

1080
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,440
market across all the food stuffs and

1081
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,680
you guys can bid for what you want and

1082
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,200
they'll be pric

1083
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,440
but none of it's real it's not real

1084
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,960
money okay it's all going to be free but

1085
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,720
we are going to if if you're someone who

1086
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,160
really wants potatoes you will bid the

1087
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,079
most for potatoes and use up more of

1088
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,559
your fake points to get potatoes and

1089
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,960
that will allocate the potatoes the

1090
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:16,119
folks who really needing the most so

1091
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,599
essentially they created a scarcity

1092
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:20,480
where there was none before there was no

1093
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:21,880
scarcity you just said I want potatoes

1094
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,720
you got potatoes until they ran out of

1095
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,160
potatoes and didn't necessarily go to

1096
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,559
the place that need potatoes the most

1097
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,960
now the place that needs potatoes the

1098
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,280
most will bid the most for potatoes and

1099
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,720
the potatoes will be allocated there so

1100
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,640
that's an example how you can use the

1101
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,880
price mechanism while still helping the

1102
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,040
poor you can use the price mechanism to

1103
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,839
make sure the right Goods get allocated

1104
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,079
