2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,719
there are some pretty powerful computers

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,160
in the world but one of the things we're

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,080
going to see is that there are some

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,920
functions so

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:21,320
complex that no computer no matter how

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:24,760
powerful could possibly confute them

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,679
sorry guys GLE theorem is a result about

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,560
the complexity of mathematical truth it

10
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,800
tells us that arithmetical truth is so

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,600
complex that no computer program could

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,680
output every arithmetical truth and no

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,480
falsehood for more MIT moments from MIT
