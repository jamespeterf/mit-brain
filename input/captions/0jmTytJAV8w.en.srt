1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,560
uh so I do want to start with a couple

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:08,960
caveats uh the first is that my natural

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,920
metabolic pace is quite fast I tend to

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,920
accelerate as I go sometimes I I'll try

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,120
not to but it does happen uh and so if

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,680
you have questions you know just

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,680
interrupt me uh I much prefer to take

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,439
questions like as there are points that

9
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,680
need clarification rather than waiting

10
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,400
to the end as Emily mentioned I'm part

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,920
of the asiba which is the human mamalian

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,560
brain Atlas project led by Eden at Allen

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,119
Institute uh we also have our own U1

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,239
that's a no cost extension a lot of the

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,520
stuff I'm going to show comes from that

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,520
and then there's this new ni brain

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,239
connects initiative that we have a U1

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,360
and anastas Andi has a um1 that we're

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,800
part of um and so I'm I'm going to give

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,039
so I have two talks listed here really

21
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,719
not two talks it's really like half a

22
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:51,000
talk and three qus of a talk something

23
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,680
like that but I can go fast enough that

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,840
it fits in one so and so the Sy this

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,039
stuff is going to be kind of background

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,120
for the second part um and the other

27
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,760
thing I'll say is that when I I was

28
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,720
talking with Kiku and Emily about what

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,080
to present you know they um they wanted

30
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,840
to make sure that I knew that this was

31
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,200
for a diverse audience and including a l

32
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,360
audience and that's fine and so the talk

33
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,560
is kind of Geared for that and so I'm

34
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,680
not going to go into a lot of technical

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,520
detail but I'm happy to like if anyone's

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,720
interested in model architecture or

37
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,920
whatever I'm happy to talk about it at

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,200
any level that you want and uh I'll try

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,479
to show people as I go this is work from

40
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,799
a ton of people over a lot of years and

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,040
I'll I'll you know these are the kind of

42
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,920
the primary ones but I'll Point people

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
out as I go

44
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,880
okay

45
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,640
so there's some issues with trying to

46
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,240
use modern deep learning particularly in

47
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,360
the world of MRI clinical MRI uh and

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,640
it's kind of easy to come up with this

49
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,399
kind of list we need a lot of of

50
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,040
manually annotated data like two or

51
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,880
three data sets is not enough five or 10

52
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,479
is probably not enough you can do a lot

53
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,799
with five or 10 but if you have a

54
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,920
thousand you can do a lot more um

55
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,920
annotation quality varies a ton uh if

56
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,159
anyone here has ever tried to label 3D

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,640
data sets it's an awful thing to do it

58
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,960
requires years of therapy for the rest

59
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,119
of your life after you've done it for a

60
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,520
while because we as human beings are

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,160
terrible at this like we have no um

62
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,720
phenomenological or or

63
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,959
um it we have no reason to have any

64
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,720
confidence say this at at taking 2D

65
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,280
sections and stacking them together in

66
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,800
our head in 3D and if you've done this

67
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,879
what you do is you label one slice and

68
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,760
you look at it you're like oh my God

69
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,959
that's perfect it's brilliant and then

70
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,640
you label the next slice you're like

71
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,680
that one is a work of art and then you

72
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,200
flip it into that different orientation

73
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,160
and it looks awful like there's no

74
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,480
consistency from slice to slice and so

75
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,959
this is just a hard thing to do to

76
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,640
generate ground truth data um this one

77
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,400
is a big problem for MRI in particular

78
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,000
that is if you train on a particular

79
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,879
type of data you will always be biased

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,920
towards it so if I change the way my

81
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,360
acquisition looks a little bit then the

82
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,400
network accuracy will go down and so if

83
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,280
all my Alzheimer's are scanned with one

84
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,920
type and all my controls are another am

85
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,440
I finding an effect or am I just finding

86
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,360
the fact that the images are different

87
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,360
um even if we really good at annotation

88
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,040
some stuff is really hard to annotate

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,360
like six slice MRI if I have 7 mm slices

90
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,560
and the spacing of my cortical folds is

91
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,959
2 mimers that's hard to

92
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,159
do and then lastly even if the data

93
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,040
quality is high there are some things

94
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,720
that are just intrinsically difficult uh

95
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,599
we see like the growth of lesions over

96
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,720
time and so you have a voxel that's

97
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,280
maybe a little bit brighter on time one

98
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,519
than it should be and on time two maybe

99
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,480
it's a tiny bit brighter than it was on

100
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,000
time one is a part of the lesion like

101
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,799
these boundaries are kind of fuzzy and

102
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,720
vague and so we're not very good at man

103
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,400
annotating them and I would argue that

104
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,239
this has been a problem for us

105
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,879
clinically it has been uh the primary

106
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:39,959
barrier to our ability to distribute

107
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,760
things in the clinic and to have

108
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:45,000
Radiologists get you know automated

109
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,319
measures of hi cample volume and to me

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,280
this is a failure of capitalism in

111
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:53,319
medicine because in

112
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,560
Radiology people pay for scan slots not

113
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,480
for time like ad Martinez would pay by

114
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,840
the hour but if you go and get your

115
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,280
brain scan you will pay for an MRI scan

116
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,920
and if that MRI scan is five minutes or

117
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,079
an hour it's the same price uh and in

118
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,799
MRI you like MRI is not like photography

119
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,040
the process of acquisition is kind of

120
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,560
accumulating information over time and

121
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,360
so in an hour we can acquire a much

122
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,079
better image than we can in five minutes

123
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,600
but if we acquire a much better image

124
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,479
now the radiologist has to read five

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,880
times as much data and that's also a

126
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:22,160
financial hit for the hospital and so

127
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,759
there are these incentives there these

128
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,040
capitalist incentives for crappy data in

129
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:29,400
the hospitals and U you know we fully

130
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,639
meet that that bar and routinely acquire

131
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,840
crappy data and so the question is what

132
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,400
can we do with it are there things that

133
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,440
we can do with the crappy data now with

134
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,720
the Advent of deep learning that

135
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,280
previously we

136
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,400
couldn't okay and so this part of the

137
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,880
talk um I'll talk about various

138
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,240
synthesis based deep learning I'll

139
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,680
explain what I mean by that um I think

140
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,960
the biggest challenge in the development

141
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,360
of this stuff is

142
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,560
this slide that I stole from Anastasia

143
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,280
yiki which is that it takes so long to

144
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,720
train these things you know you have an

145
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,199
idea and you're like oh this is going to

146
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,160
be great and you set it train and then

147
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,840
two weeks later it's converged and you

148
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,639
run it you're like oh my God I did

149
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,680
something stupid and then you fix it and

150
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,919
you start it again and then two weeks

151
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,680
later you know it repeats and so the the

152
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,880
the development cycle has really slowed

153
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,039
down because of

154
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,280
this okay so what do I

155
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:21,080
mean by the synthesis stuff and why do

156
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,319
we need it so Mr is a wildly flexible

157
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,120
technology if you don't know much about

158
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:28,199
Mr the reason it's so popular is that we

159
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,479
can derive contrast from many many many

160
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,240
different things in the anatomy from it

161
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,720
so here's an example of what we'll call

162
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,080
Mr modality so T1 weighted light matters

163
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,680
bright gray matters dark uh T2 weighted

164
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,880
you get the inverse contrast prot and

165
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,720
density weighted is kind of somewhere in

166
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,759
the middle this is a sequence commonly

167
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,520
used at MGH for um deep brain

168
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,880
stimulation targeting we you know you

169
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,720
can you have the flexibility to null

170
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,080
certain tissue classes so we want a

171
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,240
technique that works for all of this

172
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,680
stuff but NR we can do a lot of other

173
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,639
things even within the class of two

174
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,639
unweighted images there are a lot of

175
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,680
other image types that we would all call

176
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,319
to un weighted but they have different

177
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,639
contrast properties the gr matter is

178
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,319
darker it's brighter um in Mr we

179
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,080
frequently play the game of sacrificing

180
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,360
SNR for CNR that is we trade off signal

181
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,960
we trade off increased noise for

182
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,919
increased contrast uh and so this for

183
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,440
example does NP ra which has higher

184
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,400
contous to noise than a flash scan but

185
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,720
lower SNR than the flash scan and then

186
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,720
we can mess around with the resolution

187
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,120
right we can change the the the

188
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,919
orientation of our slices so this is an

189
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,000
axial acquisition a coronal a Sagal one

190
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,039
um we can skip space in the slice we can

191
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
take a 3mm slice skip a millim take a 3

192
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,599
m slice or we can just take thick slices

193
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,039
and so we would like a technique that

194
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:43,599
works for all of this stuff and that's

195
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,639
hard so one approach is just to build a

196
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:48,039
supervised CNN these days that usually

197
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,319
means a unet units pretty much

198
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:52,080
outperform anything uh on at least image

199
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,840
analysis stuff uh so I can take a

200
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,280
supervis CNN take this type of input

201
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,280
manually label a bunch of outputs and I

202
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,160
can create a a a nice CNN or unit that

203
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,800
can

204
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,440
automatically label axial T1 scans right

205
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,360
and that works if I can you know

206
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,360
manually label 20 or 50 or 70 of these

207
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,560
but it falls apart if I apply it to

208
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,080
something else so if I apply this actual

209
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,639
scan to a chronal scan this is the

210
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,720
result like everything just Falls to

211
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,840
Pieces um and of course it even gets

212
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
worse if I apply it to a different

213
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,800
contrast like to a a T2 weighted scan

214
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,960
okay so what's the alternative well

215
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,560
sorry uh and so this this is the case

216
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,960
across kind of broad changes in contrast

217
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,120
but even for small changes in contrast

218
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,720
networks are super good at picking up

219
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,919
tiny details images um they're great at

220
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,400
cheating if you have't ever trained a

221
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,680
network networks are are the best

222
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,879
cheaters you you will ever encounter uh

223
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,080
and so you have to watch them like a

224
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,479
hawk because they will learn a way to

225
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,199
solve the problem that is not the way

226
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,080
that you want it to solve it and so this

227
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,479
is an example uh this is hipocampal

228
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,120
volume uh compared to ground truth so

229
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,639
this is this is a dice score so one

230
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,879
means perfect overlap between the ground

231
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,280
truth and the automated and zero means

232
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,759
no overlap uh and this is was kind of

233
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,280
our state of the-art before the Advent

234
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,919
of deep learning and if you train a unit

235
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,879
on just the two unweighted images just

236
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:12,039
this class of t18 images these MP rages

237
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:14,319
you can do pretty well you can get 88 89

238
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,520
you know close to 90% accuracy and if I

239
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,440
take this network and I apply it to a

240
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,680
flash scan which is a two1 weighted scan

241
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,360
like the the white matter is bright the

242
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,440
gray matter is intermediate and the CSF

243
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,280
is dark um you get this catastrophic

244
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,520
loss of accuracy and it's because the

245
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,159
network has learned these subtle details

246
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,599
of what it means to be an rage these

247
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,599
frequency filters that we that we

248
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,399
implicitly apply on them and it doesn't

249
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,959
generalize so this we generally call The

250
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,680
Domain Gap that is a network train for

251
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,120
this sequence doesn't work well for this

252
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,479
sequence and this is you know a little

253
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,959
bit of a toy example there there are

254
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,519
things that I can do to make this better

255
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,160
I can augment my input data I can add

256
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:50,720
noise I can you know mess around with

257
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,120
the contrast and that will help but I

258
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,240
think you will never get away from the

259
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,399
bias of the MPR ra sequence because

260
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,800
that's what you're trained on and you

261
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,760
and even worse you will never know if

262
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,399
you got away from bias because we can't

263
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,519
ever prove a lack of bias right proving

264
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,680
a lack of bias would be proving the null

265
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,240
and so all we can show is that there's

266
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,920
no bias at a certain level okay so what

267
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,079
can we do about this we'll skip this so

268
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,600
we could manually label every single

269
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:17,640
type of scan Under the Sun but that's of

270
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,640
course not

271
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,040
tractable okay so the proposed solution

272
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,399
uh is something this this was actually

273
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:30,640
Adrian Do's idea uh and it came from

274
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,920
this process of trying to augment the

275
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,800
data and augmentation in deep learning

276
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,160
means taking your training data and

277
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,120
making it worse in various ways adding

278
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,440
noise espcially warping it adding you

279
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,480
know shading uh intensity artifacts over

280
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,000
space this kind of thing and at some

281
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,600
point after kind of making these

282
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,120
augmentations increasingly wacky Adrian

283
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
had the Insight of why do we need the

284
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,680
images at all and so the way we train

285
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,519
networks these days is without any real

286
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,680
data so the way it goes is we start with

287
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,880
a 3D anatomical segmentation like this

288
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,440
the segmentation doesn't have to be

289
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,200
manual segment a it doesn't even have to

290
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,839
be that accurate because we're not going

291
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,279
to pair it with image

292
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,120
data then from each one of these we'll

293
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,440
sample a spatial transform to create you

294
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,440
know a subject so we'll warp it in some

295
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,600
way so here are a bunch of different

296
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,560
subjects synthetic subjects warped and

297
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,160
then for each of these tissue classes we

298
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,519
will sample a set of intensities so I'll

299
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,800
sample a mean and a variance to the

300
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,120
white matter a mean and a variance for

301
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,839
the alus and for the basil ganglia and

302
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,680
I'll just make up an image right and

303
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,680
this is what the images look like and

304
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,480
the images are are crazy uh and you know

305
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,839
Benjamin Benjamin B who I'll show in a

306
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,240
second who

307
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,120
that here's Benjamin um Benjamin was uh

308
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,680
uhen glacius a grad student when he

309
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,639
wrote this stuff he was now a postto

310
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,360
across the street with poina goolan at

311
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,800
MIT and Benjamin had trouble publishing

312
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,600
this and the reason he had trouble

313
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,240
publishing this is people looked at

314
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,959
these images and they kept saying well

315
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,240
that doesn't look like an MRI your MRI

316
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:58,399
simulator is awful what are you up to uh

317
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,079
and for some reason we could never

318
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,519
explain to people efficiently that we're

319
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,079
not trying to simulate a realistic MRI

320
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,600
all we're trying to do is kind of span

321
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,600
the range of variability we expect to

322
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,240
see in the input sequences and then and

323
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,120
the idea is that if this data is kind of

324
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,760
more variable more difficult to segment

325
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,360
than the real data you know that the

326
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,079
network by the time you get the new real

327
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,519
data like this is easy uh and I I'll

328
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,920
show you kind of some more quantitative

329
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,360
analysis than my you know head swipe

330
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,560
this is easy but it turns out that

331
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,079
that's the case that if you that in the

332
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,560
cases where we took this data and we

333
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:30,560
tried to make it more realistic we found

334
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,519
accuracy went

335
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,920
and that we're better off kind of

336
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,200
spanning this range of of wide

337
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,240
variability than we are trying to make

338
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,040
things

339
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:41,360
realistic um and so this works so here's

340
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,000
a set of uh images that were all

341
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,720
segmented by the same unit the unit was

342
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,720
trained without ever being exposed to

343
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,760
real MRI just all these synthetic data

344
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,000
sets that we created um and here's you

345
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,720
know increasing resolution or sorry

346
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,320
decreasing resolution increasing boxal

347
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,120
size so 1 mm to 7 mm and then two

348
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,160
different types of scans and yet you get

349
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,600
pretty much the same segmentation

350
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,639
so it's pretty much invariant to the

351
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,360
input data and of course you know if you

352
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,279
have 7 mm slices you're not going to

353
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,040
extract as um as sensitive information

354
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,279
as you are from the one millim data but

355
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,959
we're not biased towards one or the

356
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,680
other and this is just to show that that

357
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,639
point that here's here's the data set

358
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,079
that it was trained on and when you

359
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,079
train a unit on that data it does great

360
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:24,800
but this thing shown green is the syn

361
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:26,880
stuff and you see it maintains high

362
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,600
accuracy across every different type of

363
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,040
Mr sequence and you can even give it a

364
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,600
CT scale and it'll do something

365
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,839
reasonable even though the CT shows no

366
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,800
contrast between

367
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,240
gr okay so that's one game we can play

368
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,639
another is something that yeno was up to

369
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,920
which is um synthesis so I'll skip this

370
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,800
um and this is kind of important for

371
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,360
some of the ban stuff which I'll explain

372
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,440
why in a second and so the idea here is

373
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,560
that we're going to do the same thing

374
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,920
we're going to start with a pool of

375
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,440
label Maps uh we'll sample a label map

376
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,560
we'll warp it to create an individual

377
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,279
subject but now instead of throwing out

378
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,480
the image intensities I'll use the image

379
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,320
intensities of targets so this is the

380
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,480
real scan that was acquired for this

381
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,480
subject you know it's deformed in the

382
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,760
same way as this one so these

383
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,560
intensities match that then I'll oops

384
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,440
sorry then I'll take this scan and I'll

385
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,279
do all sorts of awful things to it I'll

386
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,160
I'll blur it I'll I'll you know create

387
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:21,320
thick slices I'll put maybe some subject

388
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,680
motion into it I'll add noise um I'll

389
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,959
change the contrast so it doesn't look

390
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,160
right uh and then we'll do regression

391
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,399
and so the game we play is uh this is

392
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,399
input to the network and this is the

393
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,760
target

394
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:38,160
output and so we'll try and um

395
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,880
synthesize what a highresolution 3D 3T

396
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,920
scan would look like from any input data

397
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,920
and this works pretty well so here's an

398
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,360
example of three different input scans

399
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,800
there's a 6mm flare there's a 5mm

400
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,040
sagittal turbos spinco and a 4mm coronal

401
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,360
tu2 and we can turn them all into

402
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,959
something that looks like a 1er MP rage

403
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,399
that we can then kind of put through any

404
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:01,399
anatomical analysis package world

405
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,560
and in ban specifically we've been

406
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,240
applying this to these low field scans

407
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,000
we've been getting um from a hyperfine

408
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,880
scanner so the this is part of Eden's

409
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,440
Yom one and Christine McDonald and Dirk

410
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Kean bought and cited a low field

411
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,079
scanner a hyperfine scanner in the

412
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,519
autopsy Suite in Dirk's autopsy suite

413
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:21,800
and so every brain that now comes to

414
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,920
autopsy uh gets wheeled into the scanner

415
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,959
and gets this type of low resolution T2

416
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,880
weighted because that's all we can get

417
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,360
on the low field scanners 3 m isotropic

418
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,680
but with this technique we can take this

419
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,600
30mm low field scan and turn it into a

420
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,160
3T EMP and further we can take this 3T M

421
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,480
and stuff it through free Surfer and

422
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,160
segment you know the cerebellum and

423
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,880
motor cortex and whatever you can get

424
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,800
these kind of detailed anatomical

425
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,440
parcellations that are registered to

426
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,440
this autopsy

427
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,160
sample and this

428
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,399
is well that was a slow transition um

429
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,560
this is what I was chatting with Kiku a

430
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,040
little bit at lunch um this is kartik's

431
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:03,440
work we can so Dirk will take photos of

432
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,240
the um the slabs after dissection but

433
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,160
before dissection we run a surface

434
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,959
scanner over the brain and we get this

435
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,240
type of 3D mesh and it only gets a

436
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,639
millimeter or two into the folds it

437
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,560
doesn't get into the depths of the folds

438
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:14,839
because we can't see it from the

439
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,160
exterior but it provides us with enough

440
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,320
geometric fiducials that we can take

441
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,399
these 3D slice or sorry these 2D

442
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,040
photographs of these 2D slices and stack

443
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:26,240
them up into a 3D Volume and use that to

444
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,319
register to the hyperfine scan and now

445
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,240
we have a path to go from any invivo

446
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:33,040
Atlas The Narrow Path right and so

447
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,319
that's what's shown here we've taken um

448
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,279
I guess this is our standard cortical

449
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:38,800
parcellation and projected it onto the

450
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:40,440
Narrow Path and now we can say to Dirk

451
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,839
we want you to take out a slab that's in

452
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,920
motor cortex or maybe it's in the

453
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,120
default mode Network maybe it's the

454
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,759
frontal component of the default mode

455
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,639
Network we can bring kind of the full

456
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,000
power of invivo Imaging to guide the

457
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,079
neuropath and of course we can go in the

458
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,600
other direction too once we have the

459
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:53,600
neuropath

460
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,519
results any questions on that stuff

461
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,440
before I

462
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,959
continue okay uh

463
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,600
another thing we can do is we can detect

464
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,040
change so change detection is if you

465
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,440
talk to a neuro radiologist they will

466
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,959
tell you that they spend the majority of

467
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,880
their time trying to detect change in

468
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,600
the brain that is they'll look at two

469
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,399
scans and they'll try and find the same

470
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,639
slice and they'll say has anything

471
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,240
changed has the legion grown are The

472
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,759
ventricle bigger is the hi smaller

473
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,639
because these are the biomarkers for

474
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:22,120
things that are going on in the brain

475
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,399
and if

476
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,959
you so Hospital information systems so

477
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,519
if we do a research study we are very

478
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,000
careful to prescribe every single thing

479
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,160
that we can think of to stay the same

480
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,519
over the course of the study we'll use

481
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,000
the same scanner we'll use the same um

482
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,240
head coil we'll use the same receive

483
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,519
coil we'll use the same sequence we'll

484
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,560
try and position the subject to the same

485
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,040
place in the scanner um that's all out

486
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,600
the window when you get a clinical scan

487
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,360
the clinical scan you will not get you

488
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,000
will not even be on the same scanner

489
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,639
like there's no provision in the

490
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
hospital information systems to say I

491
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,319
want this to be a 3T semen scan with

492
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,959
this head coil so your time one scan may

493
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:59,319
be a GE 1.5t and your time two is 3D

494
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,800
semens and the result is that if you

495
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:03,639
compare the images there will be huge

496
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,559
differences between them and the vast

497
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:06,799
majority of those differences are

498
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:08,520
technological in nature they have

499
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,880
nothing to do with the brain they just

500
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,039
the fact that the way we acquired the

501
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,679
data was different and so we've been

502
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:15,959
looking at um trying to synthesize our

503
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:17,839
way out of this problem because change

504
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:19,360
is a very difficult thing to label in

505
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,039
the brain like what real anatomical

506
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,559
change is and so here what we do is we

507
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,360
take a Time One scan in the same way we

508
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,079
did before uh sorry time one label map

509
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,000
the same way we did before we'll

510
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,880
synthesize the time two scan from it

511
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,080
like we'll move it in space a little bit

512
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,320
and then we'll introduce a little bit of

513
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,840
atrophy somewhere in the brain and

514
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,320
because we know exactly where we

515
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,840
introduce the atrophy we have ground

516
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,840
Truth for the training uh and further we

517
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,840
can introduce all sorts of um intensity

518
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,360
artifacts we could add noise we can make

519
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,679
the contrast different we can add you

520
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,080
know bias Fields blur the data and then

521
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,360
the question for the network is can it

522
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,880
take the input pair and find the true

523
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,960
anatomical change in the presence of

524
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,080
this kind of sea of technological

525
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,440
artifact uh I should note this is work

526
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,760
with sha Young

527
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,919
and this also seems to work pretty well

528
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,080
so these are real scans this is a

529
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,600
multiple sclerosis a subject with MS and

530
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,880
here's a subject with Alzheimer's

531
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,960
disease and if I take these two scans so

532
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,200
time one and time two this is real data

533
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,640
and I rigidly align them and I just do a

534
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,559
pixel-wise difference like I look at

535
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,159
just the absolute value of the

536
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,960
difference in the pixel intensi is

537
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,720
you'll get stuff everywhere so you get

538
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,120
all this stuff outside and this has to

539
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,240
do with um back shift and Mr um but then

540
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,559
you get all this stuff kind of in the

541
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,960
brain as well and and this stuff is not

542
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,159
real anatomical chain there's nothing

543
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,600
going on you know out here in the

544
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:34,760
whatever the bone of the skull uh this

545
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,280
is just the fact that the Mr scan is

546
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,679
different but the network does a nice

547
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,000
job at finding kind of these ventricular

548
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,360
changes and also this growth in um in

549
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,840
some white matter hyperintensity and the

550
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,600
same thing with the MS

551
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,039
leion okay almost done with the

552
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,559
synthesis stuff um so this is some work

553
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,559
that was done and this this stuff I'm

554
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,799
going to show in the second part of the

555
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:55,880
talk also so this stuff pay a little bit

556
00:18:53,799 --> 00:19:00,400
of attention to uh this is worked from

557
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,960
Adrian dka so Adrian's PhD work was on

558
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,760
doing nonlinear registration with deep

559
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,600
networks um you call box amorph this is

560
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,280
also across the street Adrian is now

561
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,640
faculty at MGH and he and Malta

562
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,720
developed this technique called synor

563
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,159
and in synor we have these two synthetic

564
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,799
images and they're from the same subject

565
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:19,320
and we can distort them a little bit so

566
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:20,400
there's some nonlinear Distortion sorry

567
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,559
they're not necessarily from the same

568
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,640
subject um so there there's a nonlinear

569
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,280
warp that relates them and we would like

570
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,039
to recover that mountain War um the

571
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,880
problem here is that the image

572
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,440
intensities are somewhat random and

573
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,280
there aren't really good cross modal

574
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,960
similarity metrics in kind of image

575
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,600
registration world that work well for

576
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,919
nonlinear registration work pretty well

577
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,280
for rigid and linear but it's a little

578
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,000
bit ill posed to try and recover a

579
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,400
nonlinear warp in the presence of a

580
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
nonlinear change in the intensi uh and

581
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,120
so what Adrian and Malta observed is

582
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,559
that in the synthesis framework we don't

583
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,320
have to compare these images we don't

584
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,760
have to say what transformation

585
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,000
maximizes the similarity between this

586
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,320
image pair because each one of these

587
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,080
comes with an Associated label map and

588
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,840
so instead of comparing images what we

589
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,799
can do is compare label maps and say I

590
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,280
want to recover a nonlinear deformation

591
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,840
that aligns hippocampus with hippocampus

592
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,520
and migal with Mig and phalus with

593
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,080
phalus and I don't care about the images

594
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,080
that the network jobs to figure out what

595
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,280
that means in terms of image intensities

596
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,400
and this works quite well um and further

597
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,880
so uh I'll come back to this in a second

598
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,720
we don't even need brain images we can

599
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,240
make up the input label Maps so we can

600
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,960
make up images like this this is kind of

601
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,280
multiscale pear of noise so the network

602
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,200
can take we can take this image and then

603
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,520
warp it and then train a network to

604
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,880
recover the deformation between them

605
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,120
because we have both labels that give

606
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,679
rise to this image and the image itself

607
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,320
and this will be important because

608
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:46,080
sometimes what we want to register is

609
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,520
not a

610
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,799
brain and we did a parametric study on

611
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,960
how well this works so this is the uh

612
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,799
this is the target of a deoration shown

613
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,720
in the bottom row this is the source of

614
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,600
a deoration shown in the top row this

615
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,799
was a a scan that we have a forward

616
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,039
model for image formation and so we can

617
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,280
actually synthesize images with

618
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,120
different contrasts this is a T1

619
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,080
weighted image and this is a fully PD

620
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,240
weighted image and now I'm going to run

621
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,320
image registration on each of these

622
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,320
pairs and look at the accuracy of the

623
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,240
resulting alignment okay so left to

624
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,880
right is kind of more and more cross

625
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,080
modal like this pair is the same

626
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,960
contrast this pair is completely

627
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,840
different contrast and then these are

628
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,679
different image registration techniques

629
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,840
and the blue one the top blue one is the

630
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:31,400
synth morph that was trained on brains

631
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,240
and the second blue one is the synth

632
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,840
morph that was trained only on shapes so

633
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,480
it's never seen a real brain image and

634
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,360
what you can see is that the accuracy is

635
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,679
pretty flat even out here uh where we

636
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,679
lose contrast you know where the gray

637
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,320
white contrast is largely gone the

638
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,919
accuracy stays pretty high and so we can

639
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,320
generate nonlinear registrations kind of

640
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,919
between any pairs brains and further

641
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,600
between any pairs of shapes and I'll

642
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,880
come back to that in a little

643
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,039
bit okay that's the end of the synthetic

644
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,080
deep learning stuff

645
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,720
any questions on any of

646
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,400
that okay on to multiscale stuff so this

647
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,440
is really the kind of core of our

648
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,200
contributions to ban and brain connects

649
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,559
um and in the end I think probably like

650
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,840
a lot of people here we want to

651
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,520
construct a multiscale allice of the

652
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,559
human brain and it to do that you know

653
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,520
one of the things we were discussing at

654
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:22,840
lunch is uh the crazy array of spatial

655
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,559
scales over which structures of Interest

656
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,919
occur in the human brain you know from

657
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,600
nanometer to multiple centimeters right

658
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:31,200
you know ion channels to cortical

659
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,960
patterns uh and we want to account for

660
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,240
all of these things so we would like to

661
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,240
build an array of image acquisition

662
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,799
types that reveal the these properties

663
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,480
of interest and that could be you know

664
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:41,640
genomic or proteomic or transcriptional

665
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,400
or functional or anatomical or con

666
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,600
connectional uh we want to register

667
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,120
things so we want to build registration

668
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,400
tools that'll accurately align these

669
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,600
different image types across scales and

670
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,880
contrast and it's worth noting that you

671
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,559
know this has to be cross contrast

672
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,919
there's a reason we're doing the Imaging

673
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:56,039
you know that we're doing a lectin stain

674
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:57,720
for example you know because we care

675
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,679
about the vas cure or we're doing a new

676
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,200
end stain because care about the neurons

677
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,080
and so by construction our images show

678
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,320
different things and so the contrast is

679
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,559
inevitably going to be different across

680
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,720
these registration

681
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,720
targets um once we have the registration

682
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,880
we want to build individual subject

683
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,480
level modeling tools so that we can

684
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,039
situate the results of whatever we're

685
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,640
acquiring into the context so what

686
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,840
cortical layer is it in what column is

687
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,760
it in what cortical area this kind of

688
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,080
thing and then finally once I have all

689
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,960
this data at the individual subject

690
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,240
level how do I put it all together into

691
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,320
an atys um and register my different

692
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,799
subjects together to build an atlas that

693
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,679
is representative of these of these

694
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:37,039
properties that I've just observed in

695
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,840
this unique data set and the thing

696
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,799
that's part about this is that we want a

697
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,400
tool that can register stuff that it

698
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,480
doesn't see and what I mean by that is

699
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,600
you know you can imagine a by can study

700
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,600
where we you know do a complete um

701
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,200
transcriptional characterization of you

702
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,640
know the substantial uh this is

703
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,480
Emily's project um and we find different

704
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,600
cell types in the right and and

705
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,840
now we have another subject and we want

706
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,760
to register them such that those

707
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,960
populations of cell Al line cells align

708
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,799
across subjects well that's fine for xal

709
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,679
studies in which we've done this

710
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,679
transcriptional analysis but what if I

711
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,919
want to do it in in inv Vivo what if I

712
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,240
want to apply it to Parkinson's patients

713
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,640
then I want a technique that aligns

714
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,039
these areas without being able to see

715
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,360
them right we want to be able to align

716
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,640
things that we could only see during

717
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,559
training and not necessarily at

718
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,840
inference time and I'll I'll talk about

719
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:27,880
how we do that in a little bit okay and

720
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,399
as as I mentioned this is part of this

721
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:35,000
um you one sorry U1 that um H Wang and I

722
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:38,440
have at MGH and David Boaz at bu Patrick

723
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,600
ho at Mount Si and franisco poni at um

724
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:45,039
in Florence and so in this project

725
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,480
requiring XV MRI we acquire Optical

726
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,799
coherence tomography which I'll describe

727
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,120
in a little bit because probably people

728
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:52,240
aren't familiar with it um we were doing

729
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,440
a Buu in the previous Grant in the

730
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,080
connect instantiation qu is building a

731
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,080
rig at MGH for it uh then we do light

732
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,240
sheet microscopies so florescent like

733
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:04,600
sheep micros me at FL

734
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,600
um uh there's some stereology that goes

735
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,279
on some deep learning to segment cells

736
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,679
and then we want to put them into a

737
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:12,360
coordinate system where we can start to

738
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,240
make statements about human variation

739
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,159
like how many neurons are in this layer

740
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,200
in broker area for

741
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,799
example and then as I mentioned before

742
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,960
we're also part of this agba grant the

743
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:24,039
human mamalian brain Atlas that had Lane

744
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,320
runs that at the Allen Institute and

745
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:27,320
this is where we're doing the low field

746
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,960
scanning and of course this stuff is of

747
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,159
interest because you know St was here

748
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,919
there's a grant here um looking at

749
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:36,559
similar things and then Casey Chung

750
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:39,279
who's across the street is any day now

751
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,399
can get funded also for a um1 to start

752
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:45,840
looking at um proteomics and generate

753
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:48,799
Micon scale images of entire human

754
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,080
brains okay so in general in

755
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:54,399
neuroimaging we have been historically

756
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,919
kind of left with this choice of doing

757
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:59,399
coarse images on lots of subjects on the

758
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:01,799
whole brain or doing unbelievably fine

759
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:03,480
scale images on a few samples in tiny

760
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,760
little bits of brain and we haven't been

761
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,960
able to put them together and so this

762
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,960
kind of goes from em to things like uh

763
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,520
light sheet floresent microscopy and O

764
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:16,840
and two Photon Imaging we have built

765
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,120
this program at MGH where we use our Mr

766
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:22,159
scanners as incredibly expensive

767
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,679
microscopes uh so we have a 7t scanner

768
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,399
and we use it pretty much every weekend

769
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:27,880
that's probably an exaggeration use it

770
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:29,720
many weekends where we stick a brain in

771
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,440
the scanner Friday afternoon and then

772
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,080
Monday morning we come and take it out

773
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,440
and this is again because in Mr uh time

774
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,000
is SNR and if I want to get the small

775
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:41,200
voxels I need to scan for a long time

776
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,360
and by long I typically mean 70 or 80

777
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,159
hours and so we'll we'll put a brain in

778
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,039
and we'll get this is a 100 Micron scan

779
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:48,440
we got with Brian edlo a few years ago

780
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,679
we'll get something on the order of 100

781
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,960
Micron isotropic across the whole brain

782
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:55,480
and this ends up being and actually in

783
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,799
the O as well end up being kind of our

784
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,960
intermediate spaces that we use to

785
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:01,600
facilitate take registration because

786
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,640
it's really hard to take a 2d light

787
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,000
sheet data set and register it to you

788
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,279
know an invivo atlas I need some interim

789
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,799
targets from for that registration and

790
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:14,399
that's what the ooc and the XR

791
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:16,279
present so this is an example of the Mr

792
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:19,360
we've been doing this is Divia Vin's

793
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:21,919
work you know when we were starting this

794
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,200
we kind of thought 200 Micon isotropic

795
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,720
was about where we could get and Diva

796
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,919
just totally insisted that was not true

797
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,840
she was like we can do 120 uh and the

798
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:32,320
difference between 200 and 120 in an SNR

799
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,279
sense is like a factor of I don't know

800
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,559
four in SNR I'd have to calculate it you

801
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:38,720
lose SNR really rapidly in Mr as you

802
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,039
increase voxal volume or decrease voxal

803
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,480
volume rather but Diva was right um and

804
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:47,200
if in particular she came up with a set

805
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,840
of techniques that allowed us to measure

806
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,919
these tiny little distortions you get in

807
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:55,039
samples so Mr is a magnetic um image

808
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,200
acquisition technique and so if you have

809
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,200
something that's magnetic in the field

810
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,919
of view it will distort the coordinates

811
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,760
system of the image and in particular

812
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:04,159
iron deposition in the tissue causes

813
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,080
these micro distortions almost

814
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,640
everywhere um and so mostly people don't

815
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,240
care because your Distortion is like two

816
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,039
300 microns and your voxels are 2

817
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,080
millimeters so who cares about 200

818
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:15,679
Micron Distortion and so Divia had to

819
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,679
invent this set of techniques to measure

820
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,480
and remove these distortions and for us

821
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:23,840
it makes a big difference so this is the

822
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,600
cerebellum of um a language using so I'm

823
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,200
not allowed to use her name of a

824
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,919
language using great ape that died of

825
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,880
natural causes who scanned a few years

826
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,039
ago whose name you probably know if

827
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,799
you've seen any of the television series

828
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,799
on them and you can see the impact of

829
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,399
the Distortion correction all of a

830
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:39,200
sudden we can see you know three layers

831
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:40,760
in the cerebellum where it was really

832
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,840
difficult to before and the same thing

833
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,880
is true in the cortex um we lose I'll

834
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,600
talk about vessels a lot in a little bit

835
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,559
but we lose a lot of the vessels if we

836
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,600
don't do the Distortion correction right

837
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,080
you can kind of see them but you can see

838
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,000
how they're blurred but they get much

839
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,080
sharper after Distortion correction and

840
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,720
the same thing is true of cortical

841
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,559
layers here's a band of B that we mostly

842
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,559
don't see in the Distortion I guess this

843
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:04,159
is probably um Street of jari in V1

844
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,679
maybe um but you can see how much

845
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,679
clearer it gets after we correct this

846
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,679
200 or so Micon

847
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,760
Distortion we've also been pursuing this

848
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,440
technique called Optical coherence

849
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,159
tomography which um most of you probably

850
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,279
have not heard of and this is stuff that

851
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:20,840
David and I started way back when uh

852
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,559
Caroline came as a postto and she's now

853
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,600
faculty who I also came as a postu and

854
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,679
she's now faculty I showed these slides

855
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,760
to Caroline and she's like why are you

856
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,919
showing 15-year-old slides um in part

857
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,440
because I had it but in part because

858
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,760
they're just beautiful like this is an

859
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,960
image of the human medulla with o so the

860
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,880
background image I think is like I guess

861
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,799
it's four Micron pixel size for the

862
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,600
whole thing but if I zoom in we could

863
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,679
also require higher ones we like half a

864
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,640
micron and so we're really almost at the

865
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:50,159
defraction limit here um and the nice

866
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,760
thing about o is that in contrast to two

867
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:56,360
Photon in O we acquire an entire line at

868
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:58,679
a time so we inquire a an entire line in

869
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,159
depth it's not a point wise measure

870
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:01,679
and so it's much faster than two Photon

871
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,360
and so that lets us do these large field

872
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,960
of views I'll show you what I mean so

873
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,240
here's uh OC of the the medial temporal

874
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,120
lobe and there's a little inset here

875
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,559
which I'll zoom in on so you can see

876
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,480
kind of the astonishing resolution we

877
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:18,960
get with the large field of view of

878
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,880
these Mossy fibers in the hip

879
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,080
campus and then the other game we can

880
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,600
play with OT is we can put polarization

881
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,640
on the incoming light and the reason

882
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,240
that's important is that the

883
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,000
polarization state of the return light

884
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,240
will tell you something about the B

885
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,480
refringent properties of the thing you

886
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,080
imaged and milin is B refringent and so

887
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,880
by putting polarization on the incoming

888
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,440
light we can recover the optic axis of

889
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,960
the thing we're Imaging that is the

890
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,240
orientation of the axon that we're

891
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,000
Imaging that's what's shown

892
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:49,640
here um this movie is playing so there

893
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,440
are two two critical things about the o

894
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:54,000
one is this polarization so polarization

895
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,399
sensitive OC that's say directly image

896
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,799
axonal orientation and the reason this

897
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,519
is critical particularly in regions like

898
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,440
the human brain stem if you have tightly

899
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,840
packed fibers even if you can resolve an

900
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,480
individual axon if it was sitting by

901
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,159
itself you know with no friends and

902
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,519
crying softly at lunch or something uh

903
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,679
you can't image it if it's in a densely

904
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,799
packed region because it just looks all

905
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,279
white right to image it you would need

906
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:19,799
the resolution to see the milein Sheets

907
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:22,080
if you wanted to accurately label

908
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:23,679
individual axons and that's you know an

909
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,360
order magnitude more resolution that's

910
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,600
probably sub um you know 100 nmet or so

911
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,080
and I'll show a little bit of that later

912
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,559
on but o doesn't suffer from that

913
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,840
problem because o directly images

914
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,919
orientation so even in tightly packed

915
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,679
regions we get an accurate measure of

916
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:42,159
the orientation of the axons okay the

917
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,120
other important thing about o play this

918
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,919
move

919
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:49,639
again is

920
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:51,760
that in OC we're Imaging a a cut block

921
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:52,960
of tissue um potentially whole

922
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,639
hemisphere but we haven't ever built a

923
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,200
rig to do something that big but the

924
00:31:55,639 --> 00:32:00,200
Imaging is with laser light the Pates

925
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,200
the cut surface it penetrates about 200

926
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,159
300 microns under the cut surface this

927
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,039
is like formul and fixed tissue and so

928
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,320
the game we'll play is we'll acquire a

929
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:09,039
line in depth of a couple hundred

930
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,279
microns and then we'll cut off the top

931
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,639
layer and we'll acquire another line and

932
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,320
this of course is the reverse of what

933
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,600
you do in standard microscopy where you

934
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,080
cut and then image and so we're Imaging

935
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,480
and then cutting as opposed to cutting

936
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,799
and then Imaging and you know image then

937
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,679
cut cut then image it doesn't sound like

938
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:26,000
a big deal but in fact it's everything

939
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:28,000
and the reason it's everything is that

940
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,679
we're Imaging before we introduce s

941
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,120
specific distortions and so to generate

942
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,840
a 3D Volume of obct all we do is stack

943
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,080
up the the optical images and that's

944
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:40,120
what's shown here play this movie again

945
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:43,000
so here's a little spinning

946
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,600
movie of the OT and you can see that you

947
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,440
can't see the Imaging plane we can't

948
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,519
tell what orientation we have the data

949
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,679
at and these are three orthogonal views

950
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:55,000
through the same tissue so this is the

951
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,399
plane of sectioning XY the optical plane

952
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,919
so this is what we would call an on FAS

953
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:02,120
image but if I take this and flip at 90°

954
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,679
or a different 90° you can't see the

955
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,519
slices um and this is because there is

956
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,639
no Distortion because we're Imaging

957
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:11,039
before we cut and physical distortions

958
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:13,080
are really hard to remove and the fact

959
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,440
that the ooc doesn't have these physical

960
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,480
distortions means we can use it as kind

961
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,559
of a vertical coordinate system we can

962
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,840
take things like light sheet data and we

963
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,240
know exactly what distortions are

964
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,000
induced because we have an image of the

965
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,200
tissue at Micron scale that doesn't have

966
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,200
those distortions

967
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,519
any questions on the OT stuff before I

968
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,880
continue or on anything else for that

969
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:38,919
matter

970
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,240
okay uh we're also doing a bunch of

971
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:41,960
light sheet Imaging and this is stuff

972
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,600
that goes on in in Florence with

973
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,919
Franchesco and aren and den and

974
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,880
Josephine beatric so here we've been

975
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:53,639
playing with this lipophilic die called

976
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:57,159
D and Di likes uh myin environments and

977
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:59,399
it will bind to um myelinated fibers or

978
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:00,960
even very lightly melinated fibers and

979
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:02,679
the result is that we can get images of

980
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,679
axons with the light sheet floresent

981
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:06,559
microscopy and so for The Connect

982
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,320
projects we're doing di that's shown

983
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,720
here but we're also doing maybe new N I

984
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,040
don't know what your experience is with

985
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,119
new n for us new is really finicky um

986
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,760
there are samples that it just doesn't

987
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,440
work on for reasons we don't really

988
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,079
understand um and so there are other

989
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,359
stains that we're still playing with for

990
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,200
neuron

991
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,639
stains and then finally at the highest

992
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:29,760
resolution um the lens group is working

993
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,119
on um two Photon after expansion

994
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,040
microscopy and so on the left I'm

995
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:36,679
showing what we would very much like to

996
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,839
do is do the two Photon Imaging on the

997
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,480
tissue that we already did the light

998
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,639
sheet Imaging on it's not EXA it's not

999
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,800
completely clear that's going to work

1000
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,760
they've been working on it and they've

1001
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,720
gotten to about 3.5x expansion and that

1002
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,879
looks pretty good this is what 4x

1003
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,520
expansion would look like and so here

1004
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,440
you can see Mile and sheets right so

1005
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,280
here we can actually see individual

1006
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,960
axons at the scale that we can actually

1007
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,960
label them right and so this is kind of

1008
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,960
our ground truth and this we're not

1009
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,440
going to get you know we'll get this in

1010
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,960
like millimeter cubes of tissue we're

1011
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,560
not going to get this in centimeters but

1012
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,280
the light sheet we'll get over the

1013
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,280
entire human brain

1014
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,000
stem

1015
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,760
okay I'm going to talk about

1016
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,640
registration stuff if there's nothing on

1017
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,440
the

1018
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,119
acquisition okay so for no particular

1019
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,240
reason I'm going to go from kind of

1020
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,880
biggest scale to smallest scale so part

1021
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:33,839
of the hmba project is

1022
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:36,400
getting uh human hospice patients to

1023
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:39,640
consent to being scanned prior to death

1024
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,440
and then to brain donation um and there

1025
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,920
are an unbelievable array of basic

1026
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,839
questions in Neuroscience we have been

1027
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,920
unable to answer because we've never had

1028
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,319
this data so for example um NY kisher

1029
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,359
whose lab is across the street and and

1030
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:57,160
Brandon kogai has been pursuing uh human

1031
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,480
functionally defined cortical areas for

1032
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,280
decades she has a spot in the in the

1033
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,160
inferior temporal lobe called the fusor

1034
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,960
face area um there are various other

1035
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,560
ones but in the end is it a cortical

1036
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,520
area is the face area a cortical area we

1037
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,079
don't know does it have a different

1038
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,720
connectivity profile than stuff around

1039
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,440
it does it have different molecular

1040
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,400
properties you know are the cells

1041
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,480
different there than a neighboring

1042
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,160
cortex would we see some boundary and

1043
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,599
the answer is we just don't know and

1044
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,240
it's because we've never had this paired

1045
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,200
data and so one of the things we've been

1046
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,200
working on are tools to register inv

1047
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,640
Vivo and xvivo data this is stuff that

1048
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,440
lives I

1049
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,960
did that's not supposed to say that

1050
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,079
that's supposed to say lii um and here

1051
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:39,720
we built some tools to register in Vivo

1052
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,400
and xvivo data um and this is hard

1053
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,560
because you can see the dramatic

1054
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,839
deformation uh that happens X Vivo so

1055
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,359
when you do uh an autopsy and you take

1056
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,079
the brain out you cut into the the dura

1057
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:51,880
you know the CSF spills out kind of

1058
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,280
gravity takes over things sag there are

1059
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,440
these large scale deformations that

1060
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,960
occur in the tissue but we would like to

1061
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,680
establish a pointwise correspondence we

1062
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,440
would like to know that this point in

1063
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,880
the invivo is exactly this point in the

1064
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:06,560
XO right and so one observation that we

1065
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,319
made um I should thank the group at UB

1066
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,880
Who provided this data this is from the

1067
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:12,480
ACT study um is that if you do a

1068
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,880
cortical surface reconstruction of the

1069
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,560
invivo data and the XV data you can

1070
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,480
again kind of see the change in overall

1071
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,119
geometry like this one the shape of this

1072
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,400
is pretty different than the shape of

1073
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,640
this but the red green patterns are the

1074
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,200
cortical folding patterns so this is the

1075
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,119
central sulcus the red are suside the

1076
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,000
green or Gyro and and you can see that

1077
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:32,040
the folds are pretty much perfectly

1078
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,839
preserved that is you know here's like

1079
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,440
the Omega the typically the human hand

1080
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,359
area um and you can see it like right

1081
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,760
there right so there's this kind of

1082
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:43,240
large scale deformation that occurs but

1083
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,800
the folding patterns are preserved and

1084
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,200
so if we can align

1085
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,960
folds then we can account for the vast

1086
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,160
majority of the nonlinear deformation

1087
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,760
that occurs across death and actually

1088
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,960
the truth is that this registration is

1089
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,480
much easier than the cross subject

1090
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,160
registration again because the topology

1091
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,240
of the fold is preserved and I'll I'll

1092
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:02,520
talk about that in a minute so here's an

1093
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:05,000
example this is the invivo scan an MP

1094
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,160
rage um that we've already warped to be

1095
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,160
registered with the XO this is the 200

1096
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,680
Micron xvoo and I'll go back and forth

1097
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,200
so you can see that they are pretty

1098
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,160
perfectly

1099
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:20,520
registered right and this now lets us

1100
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,520
use this scan um as kind of a neuropath

1101
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,200
magnifying glass that is I can look at

1102
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,839
the scan this is Brian edlo who's a

1103
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,920
neurologist at MGH I worked with for

1104
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,240
years and Brian looked at this mic on

1105
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,200
scan he said oh look at the white matter

1106
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,440
here this white matter is rarified like

1107
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,720
if I had seen this on the invivo scan I

1108
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,240
would have recommended something some

1109
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,359
Downstream um followup of it and if we

1110
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,720
go back to the invivo scan we can see

1111
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,240
that it was there there's kind of this

1112
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,000
darkening of the white matter here but

1113
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,839
it wasn't Salient enough in would be

1114
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,040
picked up by radiologist and neurologist

1115
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,160
time and the same thing elsewhere so

1116
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,480
here's a bit of white matter that's

1117
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,680
bright brighter than it should be and

1118
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,119
again if we go back to the invivo scan

1119
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,440
we can again see it was there but we it

1120
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:59,640
just wasn't seen at the time it wasn't

1121
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,599
in

1122
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,720
red okay um so now I'm going to talk

1123
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,240
about registering the XO data and here

1124
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,000
we're going from 1 to three Micron light

1125
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:11,640
sheet rest of microscopy uh or the 75

1126
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,800
nanometer to two Photon which we don't

1127
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,720
have much of yet so we haven't really

1128
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,440
done anything on this all the way out to

1129
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,680
the full brain or the whole hemisphere

1130
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,359
MRI and as I said this is a challenging

1131
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,400
problem it's nonlinear it's crosscast

1132
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:25,560
kind of by Design because we want the

1133
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,839
different images to tell us different

1134
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,359
things about the brain so they have to

1135
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:32,240
have different information um contained

1136
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,839
in them um and it's wildly cross scale

1137
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,040
you know it's like one Micon pixels to

1138
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,319
120 Micon pixels so whatever that is 100

1139
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,839
cubed difference in voxal volume between

1140
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:43,119
these and those and then the 1

1141
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:46,680
millimeter of course are even coarser

1142
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,880
okay the O is a critical interim Target

1143
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,280
because it should exactly match the

1144
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,240
light sheet data so the O we take the

1145
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,880
image we cut it and then we do light

1146
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,640
sheet on that cut and so the ooc image

1147
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,359
is exactly the same tissue as the light

1148
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,440
sheet data but the light sheet is

1149
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:05,599
deformed by clearing cutting and

1150
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,359
mounting this kind of thing okay so as I

1151
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,079
mentioned before there are cross cross

1152
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,640
model similarity metrics things like mut

1153
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:12,880
information and correlation ratio um but

1154
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,240
they're not great for nonlinear

1155
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,240
registration you can get them to work

1156
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:19,599
but they're kind of flaky and it tends

1157
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,040
to be a little bit osed that is you can

1158
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,599
generate nonlinear registrations that

1159
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,839
are the wrong one that will minimize

1160
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:26,079
those things or maximize them if you're

1161
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,200
trying to maximize them and so we would

1162
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,520
like to kind of um find a metric that's

1163
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,400
more robust than

1164
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,400
this but of course we already know how

1165
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,400
to do this because we've done it with

1166
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,880
the synor shapes right we we've

1167
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,319
generated these synthetic networks that

1168
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,079
know how to do nonlinear cross modal

1169
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,920
registration and they've figured out

1170
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,440
their own similarity metric because all

1171
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,800
we told them was make sure the labels

1172
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,079
line and they figure out what image

1173
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,720
intensities what what matching of image

1174
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:53,119
intensities result in label

1175
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,079
alignment okay so here are some examples

1176
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,480
um this is U Wang's work used another

1177
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,640
post that came from across the street he

1178
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,000
did a PhD with just Solomon in kind of

1179
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,040
geometry processing here's an example of

1180
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,560
a caltin stain this is light she

1181
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,800
fluoresent microscopy this is O of the

1182
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:09,160
same tissue and you can see why this is

1183
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,520
a hard registration problem right

1184
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,760
there's a lot of deformation between

1185
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,440
these two they have different contrast

1186
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,200
properties there's all sorts of stuff

1187
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,119
going in the light sheet all sorts of

1188
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,359
intensity artifacts in light sheet data

1189
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,560
you know these kind of exponential light

1190
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:23,040
attenuation and um these areas where the

1191
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:27,040
the tissue wasn't quite flat and so we

1192
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:29,280
lose signal um and so for this we don't

1193
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,960
again we don't build our image matching

1194
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,599
based on image intensities that is I'm

1195
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,319
not trying to say bright stuff here

1196
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:36,119
should align with bright stuff there

1197
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:38,200
instead what I'm doing is segmenting the

1198
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,960
boundaries of the tissue and maybe the

1199
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,920
white matter and then trying to align

1200
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,720
these

1201
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,720
segmentations and this is how that

1202
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,119
looks that's what the warp looks

1203
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:56,680
like and this is the accuracy of it so

1204
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,440
works pretty well so we can generate a

1205
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:03,520
pretty good alignment between um the Cal

1206
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,839
rtin stain light sheet image and the OCD

1207
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:09,160
and kind of another amazing thing that

1208
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:12,359
you did is he he derived a kind of

1209
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:15,200
general purpose lassan solver that is

1210
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:17,760
incredibly fast and in general when you

1211
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,680
use a lusian solver you you either use a

1212
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,559
direct solver where you give the problem

1213
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,680
set up and it gives you a solution it's

1214
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:25,040
not terribly accurate but if you want

1215
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,480
accuracy you have to use an iterative

1216
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,960
solver and your iterative solver

1217
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,559
basically recompute the solution until

1218
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,559
you achieve a desired accuracy so if you

1219
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,319
say your tolerance is 10 Theus 7th it

1220
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:36,680
might run for four hours until it gets

1221
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,280
there um but you developed a direct

1222
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:40,599
solver that has the same accuracy as the

1223
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,480
additive solvers and the reason that's

1224
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:45,160
important is that for us I mean I think

1225
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,839
it's important for a lot of things um

1226
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,440
the reason it's important for us is it

1227
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:53,440
allows us to do this registration in

1228
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,079
real time and that is he's deriving he's

1229
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,760
built a technique that estimates a Time

1230
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:58,119
varying velocity field that encodes the

1231
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,240
deformation

1232
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,520
and if any of you do n your registration

1233
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,200
time bearing velocity Fields take hours

1234
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,359
to integrate like to get a solution

1235
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:10,359
takes hours of this size images um but

1236
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:12,480
use technique takes about a second uh

1237
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:14,240
and this is this was the slide I was

1238
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,359
waiting for this morning

1239
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,880
Emily because you was working on it till

1240
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:18,920
this morning this is like a python demo

1241
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,200
we're gonna we're going to integrate

1242
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,440
this into our visualization environment

1243
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,800
this is not integrated at all but it

1244
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,160
shows that this technique can be

1245
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:28,800
interactive and it's fast enough that I

1246
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,480
can take so this is the source image

1247
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,400
this is the target image you can compute

1248
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,440
the initial warp and then iteratively

1249
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,319
improve it by picking point

1250
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,640
correspondences so you can say this this

1251
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:39,800
blood vessel is that blood vessel and

1252
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,920
this spot in the brain is that spot in

1253
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,839
the brain and it will iterally recompute

1254
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,319
the registration um to update the

1255
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:49,520
accuracy so there's the initial

1256
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:50,720
registration and I'll note the actual

1257
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,559
registration is faster than the movie

1258
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,800
plan registration takes about a second

1259
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:55,520
then you can pick correspondences you

1260
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,599
pick a point there and a point here and

1261
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,599
it will update the warp

1262
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,800
and then pick another couple points and

1263
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,720
it'll update the

1264
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,160
warp and so we're going to integrate

1265
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:06,440
this into our visualization tool and I

1266
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,800
think that for byan this will provide

1267
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,920
most of what we need because what we

1268
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,599
need is not to register you know a

1269
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,559
thousand images an hour we need to

1270
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:15,559
register kind of a handful of images

1271
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,960
accurately

1272
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:28,000
okay uh then from

1273
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,839
the right so now we can image the light

1274
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,960
sheet to the O we register the light

1275
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:34,760
sheet to the oct now we want to register

1276
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:37,160
the OT the MRI so here's an OC scan

1277
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,680
here's the MRI the O is not very

1278
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,680
distorted these are gentle nonlinear

1279
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,520
distortions mainly because when we do

1280
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,000
the Imaging we're kind of physically

1281
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,319
distorting the tissue a little bit we're

1282
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,480
putting in a bag or a tube or something

1283
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,520
and so there are residual and nonlinear

1284
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,280
distortions between them uh and this is

1285
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:55,160
mol's work um this is quite old now this

1286
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,359
he did like earlier in the week I think

1287
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,480
Wednesday uh and so he just took the

1288
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:02,640
synor shapes that I showed you before

1289
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,839
and he applied it to this pair and it

1290
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,240
works pretty well so here's the

1291
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,720
deformation that's induced again it's

1292
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,960
pretty gentle um and here's an example

1293
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,880
of the accuracy so I go back and forth

1294
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,200
you can see that the Mr and OCT line up

1295
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,200
pretty well

1296
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:23,480
right okay so this is where we are now

1297
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,640
um we can generate pretty good

1298
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,359
registration from single Micron light

1299
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,800
Che data all the way out to 100 micron X

1300
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:31,440
MRI from the 100 Micron X MRI we can

1301
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,240
kind of go anywhere show you that in a

1302
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,920
little bit and by anywhere I mean like

1303
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,000
inv Vivo atlases um and the registration

1304
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,640
is pretty accurate but it's accurate at

1305
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,800
the scale of a millimeter or so like if

1306
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,280
you look at it you can see that there

1307
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:47,319
inaccuracies particularly in the

1308
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,119
interior of uniform regions and that's

1309
00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:49,240
understandable because we don't have a

1310
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:51,160
lot of information in the interior of

1311
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,839
the white matter we can't tell where the

1312
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,680
superior longitudinal piculus is or

1313
00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:57,079
something right we can only tell that

1314
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,680
it's kind of bright or dark or whatever

1315
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:00,640
and so we would like to improve on these

1316
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,880
techniques to align at least mesoscale

1317
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,599
features columns layers microc columns

1318
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,680
mini columns this kind of thing okay so

1319
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:11,079
how are we going to get there well we

1320
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:13,160
know that vessels occur at almost every

1321
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:14,760
spatial scale in the brain so down to

1322
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,400
the four Micron capillary bed where you

1323
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,920
know a single red blood vessel can fit

1324
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,359
into a capillary vessels occur from

1325
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,960
there all the way out to you know the

1326
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:23,000
four five millim peel vessels that run

1327
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,359
along the surface of the brain that

1328
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,440
neurosurgeons use to find or avoid motor

1329
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,559
cortex for example and and so if we

1330
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,720
could segment the vasculature this in

1331
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:33,839
this array of images we could use

1332
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:35,200
vessels as endogenous fiducial markers

1333
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,800
and we could say I want the vessels to

1334
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,200
align across different image types right

1335
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,880
and of course the vasculature is super

1336
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,079
interesting in its own right you know as

1337
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,280
we were discussing at lunch it's what FM

1338
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:48,880
is based on knowing where the blood is

1339
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,880
um and lots of pathologies um are

1340
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,880
vascular

1341
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:57,559
pathologies okay yeah so I already said

1342
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:00,280
this so here's an example of an to O

1343
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:01,559
registration um I think Adrian and wrote

1344
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,440
this some time ago and this is an

1345
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:07,000
example of why registering vessels is

1346
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,640
important so I'll show on the left this

1347
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,400
is a pure Mutual information based

1348
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,040
registration so I'll go from the OT to

1349
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,079
the MRI and on the right we trained a

1350
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,880
network with mutual information but also

1351
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,599
telling it align vessels and here we

1352
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,000
manually labeled a set of vessels in the

1353
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,880
source and Target and so we kind of um

1354
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,160
we encourage the network to find a

1355
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:27,280
registration that also aligns the

1356
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,440
vessels and you can see that The Vessel

1357
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,240
there are a lot of vessels around but

1358
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,960
they're very small features and so a

1359
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:36,040
general intensity based metric won't

1360
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:39,200
align them unless you force it to so

1361
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:41,400
here's just go back and forth and so you

1362
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,160
know like here you can see that that

1363
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,880
vessel doesn't line

1364
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:48,559
up unless whoops wrong

1365
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,640
way unless you force it to and if you

1366
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,440
force it to then you get a similar

1367
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,680
registration but now the interior of the

1368
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,160
stuff is lining up as well and so if we

1369
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,520
could segment vessels in this array of

1370
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,319
Imaging types

1371
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,040
we could embed them in the registration

1372
00:47:59,319 --> 00:48:02,520
and tell the registration I want you to

1373
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,520
align stuff but I really want you to

1374
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:08,079
align the vasul okay and so this has led

1375
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:11,960
us into a many years

1376
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:14,559
long um hobby of segmenting vessels This

1377
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:18,240
was um yels work initially and now K

1378
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:19,640
Mori anden G are engaged it so as I

1379
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,400
mentioned vessels occur in every spatial

1380
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,280
scale and so they're present in every

1381
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,400
image we acquire in every brain region

1382
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:29,160
but they're super hard to manually reg

1383
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,359
manually annotate um you know I I said

1384
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,960
before you know we owe years of

1385
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:35,680
therapies to our Ras uh who we forced to

1386
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,800
do manual annotation we owe Decades of

1387
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,839
therapy if you've been trying to

1388
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,680
manually label vessels and it's because

1389
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:44,960
because of their um properties because

1390
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,880
they occur at the edge of the resolution

1391
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,720
you can see in every Imaging modality

1392
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,359
unless you're getting like Micron images

1393
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,440
so in like 120 Micron Mr there are you

1394
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:55,799
know 150 Micron vessels that you're like

1395
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,799
is that a vessel I guess you know in the

1396
00:48:55,799 --> 00:49:00,319
10 Micron OCT five Micron vessels that

1397
00:48:57,799 --> 00:49:02,280
we catch glimpses of and so at every

1398
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:03,640
scale it's really hard to see them and

1399
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,160
they're everywhere this is my favorite

1400
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:07,000
quote from Yale vessels everywhere and

1401
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,720
nowhere and that's because they occur in

1402
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,119
every bit of the brain but they're only

1403
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,000
like less than half a percent of the

1404
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:15,000
brain by volume of the tissue volume and

1405
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,720
so because they're so small by volume

1406
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,359
they don't they don't naturally line up

1407
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,839
using image-based intensity metrics for

1408
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:25,920
similarity for registration okay so we

1409
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,720
decided we wanted to register them uh

1410
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:32,160
sorry we wanted to segment to embed them

1411
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:34,040
in registration um I not have on the

1412
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,599
next slide and as I said this is just a

1413
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:38,359
super hard task you know and we were I

1414
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,720
mean we've played this game so many

1415
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:40,960
times in the past couple of decades

1416
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,559
where we want to segment something so

1417
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,839
we'll go out and manually label a bunch

1418
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,720
of them and then we'll train and out

1419
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:48,000
them based on the manual annotations and

1420
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,400
that completely failed for vessels and

1421
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,960
the reason it failed for vessels is that

1422
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,400
the manual annotations just weren't good

1423
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:55,160
enough um and it's not because the

1424
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,480
manual annotators failed it's because

1425
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:00,440
it's too freaking hard and you can see

1426
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:03,000
that here so this is an O so this is an

1427
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,880
on FAS image this is um in depth you can

1428
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,799
see the the striations that occur by the

1429
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,359
exponential light attenuation and so

1430
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:11,280
this was a super careful labeling I

1431
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:13,640
think Caroline Manan did this and she's

1432
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,440
super good at this she's so diligent and

1433
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,799
works you know hours on these things but

1434
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,960
even after working hours on these things

1435
00:50:17,799 --> 00:50:22,160
it's easy to find ones that are missed

1436
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,880
here and here and here and here and even

1437
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,280
this labeling of ones that I miss like I

1438
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,079
missed ones right there's probably one

1439
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,640
there one there one there one there and

1440
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:30,520
the only way to tell that their vessels

1441
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,400
like these little dark spots is to go

1442
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:33,799
through slices and say well does it look

1443
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,720
like it travels through slices is there

1444
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:38,799
a tubular structure in 3D that I caner

1445
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,400
that I can infer is present in the

1446
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:46,079
sequence of images and that's really

1447
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:49,000
hard okay so in OC it's really hard

1448
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,200
here's a similar example in X Mr like

1449
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,839
you know these bright white spots or

1450
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,359
vessels the vessels can occur um as

1451
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:56,000
bright spots in Mr but they can also

1452
00:50:54,359 --> 00:50:58,359
occur as dark spots so there was a dark

1453
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,640
vessel there I'll play this movie again

1454
00:50:58,359 --> 00:51:02,000
you can see some diving one there was

1455
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:04,240
the diving vein there probably there's

1456
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,000
one here and it's just kind of random

1457
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,160
depending on whether uh there's any

1458
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,640
blood left in the tissue because the

1459
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:10,480
blood has iron content and that makes it

1460
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,119
bright on this type of Mr but if there's

1461
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,040
no blood it's just kind of an empty

1462
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:15,799
space and it looks dark and so it's even

1463
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,200
harder because now you're looking for

1464
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:21,280
bright stuff or dark

1465
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:23,400
stuff okay so what can we do about this

1466
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,079
um and the answer is kind of the same

1467
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,520
answer as before that was a very slow

1468
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,799
transition is we can synthesize our way

1469
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,680
out of the out of the problem so we can

1470
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:33,559
generate completely synthetic vascular

1471
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,240
trees and this was stuff that Yale did

1472
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:37,599
Yale wrote this code where you start

1473
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:41,000
with kind of a root vessel uh and then

1474
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:43,799
you randomly select like a caliber

1475
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,359
tortuosity um a probability of branching

1476
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:47,200
and then you let it branch and you grow

1477
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:49,640
these vascular trees here's one with

1478
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,400
high density so density is one one

1479
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:54,880
parameter uh and here's one with low

1480
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,240
density uh and then eten and Kiara have

1481
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,000
been working on this since then etan has

1482
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,520
been working the O side and K working on

1483
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,240
the XR uh but the game we'll play is to

1484
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:05,319
take this synthetic vasular tree and

1485
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,319
build a synthetic image around it this

1486
00:52:05,319 --> 00:52:10,559
is what a synthetic image looks like for

1487
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:12,280
Mr there's a synthetic Mr image and then

1488
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,520
we'll embed our synthetic vessels in our

1489
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,200
synthetic Mr image so here's the

1490
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,280
synthetic image these dark spots are the

1491
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,839
vessels the red shows where the vessel

1492
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,960
location is the same image with and

1493
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:24,000
without the vessel labels um and now we

1494
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,280
know exactly where the vessels are and

1495
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,640
we get the advantages of the whole

1496
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,359
synthesis game which is that there is

1497
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,119
never a mismatch between the image and

1498
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:32,839
the labeling because we construct the

1499
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,280
labeling sorry we construct the image

1500
00:52:32,839 --> 00:52:37,760
from the labeling so the labeling is

1501
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:40,920
always exactly correct and and but then

1502
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,480
the question is do these images capture

1503
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:44,960
enough of the variability we see in real

1504
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,920
Mr uh to generate a good vascular

1505
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,040
segmentation and the answer is a

1506
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:52,319
qualified yes so here's an example um

1507
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,319
this is a manual annotation this is no

1508
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,079
sorry the other way this is a manual

1509
00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:57,240
annotation this is the network and this

1510
00:52:55,079 --> 00:53:01,240
is the overlay and so it works pretty

1511
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:03,680
well um it works pretty well for some

1512
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:06,799
cases for some

1513
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,400
sequences but it doesn't generalize that

1514
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:10,440
is if I tried a different kind of Mr it

1515
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,480
would fail if I give it hpct it might

1516
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:16,920
fail um

1517
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:18,440
okay so as I said this works pretty well

1518
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,920
we've got it working reasonably well on

1519
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,240
o we've got it reasonably working well

1520
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,040
in some XMR but there are a ton of

1521
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,240
things we would like to register and so

1522
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,960
there are a ton of things we would like

1523
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:29,119
to be able to segment vessels in you

1524
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,640
know the XV MRI showed you there's a ton

1525
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:35,440
of inv MRI done in the vessels mostly

1526
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,760
the contrast is generated by moving

1527
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,480
Blood by the fact that you know that the

1528
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:42,040
blood is moving this is kind of the the

1529
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:44,960
feature that invivo angiography uses to

1530
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:46,480
to um generate contrast in the vessels

1531
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,599
but there are other kinds you know in in

1532
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,119
EMP rages we see vessels for reasons I

1533
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:52,559
want to get into it they're quite bright

1534
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:56,480
in OC we see them in light sheet we see

1535
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:59,520
them in many different stains they um we

1536
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:02,280
see in the two Photon and confocal um

1537
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,960
h& you know there's new hip CT data that

1538
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,200
shows the vasculature in just beautiful

1539
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,640
detail I don't if people have seen the

1540
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,520
hip c um coming from Clare Walsh and

1541
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:12,160
Peter Lee but it's just lovely and then

1542
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,839
you know Jeff lickman is getting microct

1543
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,640
and EM that we also see the vasculature

1544
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,599
in so we would like to segment them in

1545
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:20,400
all of these

1546
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:22,960
modalities and if you work hard this is

1547
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,880
Kiara's work you know and Kiara has done

1548
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,920
a great job kind of trying to tune the

1549
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,720
synthesis

1550
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,079
both the vessel synthesis and the image

1551
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,599
synthesis to work in different Imaging

1552
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:35,480
modalities but it's a pain and you have

1553
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:37,760
to each time you have to you know and

1554
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:39,160
when a network fails there's no easy way

1555
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,280
to know why it failed like except just

1556
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,359
looking at the data like well I guess

1557
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,559
the vessels in my training set weren't

1558
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:47,119
large enough caliber like they didn't

1559
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:49,240
see these big vessels out here so maybe

1560
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:51,760
I'll tweak my synthesis so that the

1561
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:53,280
vessels it sees are larger caliber you

1562
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,000
know and then I'll wait two weeks and

1563
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,240
try it and hope my results get better um

1564
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,599
and that you could do that and and it'll

1565
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,160
work on you know time of flight images

1566
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,119
shown here it'll work on XMR and O this

1567
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,640
is around the central sulcus this is a

1568
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:08,760
different type of type of flight this is

1569
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:11,200
a kind of more standard MRI M magnetic

1570
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:13,799
resonance and geography slightly thicker

1571
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,359
resolution um I think this is a phase

1572
00:55:13,799 --> 00:55:18,040
contrast and then we got some hip C from

1573
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:19,040
the London group and it works after a

1574
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,280
little bit of tuning it works pretty

1575
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,920
well on the hip C also but we would like

1576
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,599
not to do this we would like not to have

1577
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,799
to play this game where every time

1578
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:28,200
someone gives us an image we have to

1579
00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:29,720
figure out why our tools fail on it and

1580
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,640
what we can tweak in the image synthesis

1581
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,640
in order to improve

1582
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:37,680
it okay so how can we solve this problem

1583
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,160
how can we learn to segment vessels

1584
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,920
without handcrafting the synthesis for

1585
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,240
both the image type and the the vessels

1586
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,839
um there are a giant number of

1587
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:48,440
parameters that go into the synthesis

1588
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:49,960
you know Benjamin did an amazing job um

1589
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,880
in the original synthes paper at

1590
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,880
optimizing this but he had you know I

1591
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,599
don't know 20 25 degrees of freedom you

1592
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:57,200
can't do a grid search in 25 dimensional

1593
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:00,440
space when every Point takes two weeks

1594
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:03,880
to to to generate

1595
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:05,760
um so more generally we would like to

1596
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,720
learn to modify the synthesis to

1597
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,520
optimize the accuracy of the

1598
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,520
segmentation on real data and this is

1599
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,599
distinct from learning a synthesis that

1600
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,799
optimizes the accuracy of the

1601
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:16,440
segmentation on sythetic data this is a

1602
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:19,160
very different problem and I'll talk

1603
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:21,760
about why that's the case in a second

1604
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:22,839
um uh and then of course this would be

1605
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,680
super interesting because it would tell

1606
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:26,079
us something about how networks learn if

1607
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,240
we can optimize the synthesis if we look

1608
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:31,720
at the what the Learned synthesis is

1609
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:33,720
doing we could find out what's important

1610
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:36,119
for networks during training and you

1611
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,319
know we always kind of had this idea and

1612
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:40,000
it kind of underlay a lot of the

1613
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:42,400
synthesis research that if you train a

1614
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,760
network in a difficult environment it

1615
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,799
will grow up to be a happy Network um

1616
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,760
and I don't mean that to be General

1617
00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:50,359
parenting advice you know if Danielle is

1618
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,319
watching or regini that doesn't mean

1619
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:54,160
anything about parenting um but this is

1620
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,640
was kind of the basis of the synthesis

1621
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,319
stuff is that we would show the network

1622
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:01,599
such difficult stuff that by the time it

1623
00:56:57,319 --> 00:57:02,920
got to real data it was easy okay so can

1624
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,000
we show evidence of that and I'll show

1625
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:08,440
you what I mean in a

1626
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,520
second okay so this is work with yel and

1627
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,559
Jing this is kind of the normal

1628
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:15,000
synthesis framework that is I set have a

1629
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,400
set of labels call them z um I stick

1630
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,200
them through my synthesis augmentation

1631
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,720
engine that generates an image I'll call

1632
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,880
x a synthetic image X I'll stuff that

1633
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:25,799
through my segmentation Network it

1634
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:27,440
generates a prediction why um and then I

1635
00:57:25,799 --> 00:57:29,640
put it in loss and the loss says

1636
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,240
compares the ground truth labels to the

1637
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,480
predicted labels and says well they

1638
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:35,079
don't know they that that well and so I

1639
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,559
update my network parameters to make the

1640
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:37,720
segmentation more accurate on the

1641
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:41,440
synthetic

1642
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:43,400
data okay and then the general

1643
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,880
optimization procedure we go through is

1644
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,799
messing around with the parameters of

1645
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,359
this thing and hoping that it'll get

1646
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:54,160
better on real

1647
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:56,640
data so what we did um is embed this

1648
00:57:54,160 --> 00:58:00,880
optimization into the entire network

1649
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:03,520
training and this is a difficult problem

1650
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,920
because so here I have a segmentation

1651
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,359
Network this is the same segmentation

1652
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,119
Network so I just copy the weights from

1653
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:10,839
this down to here and then I can apply

1654
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:12,240
it to real data right so I I can take a

1655
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:13,480
real data set I can stuff it through the

1656
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,240
segmentation Network I get a real

1657
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:18,000
prediction I compare it to some ground

1658
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:20,400
truth labels I have um but I can't

1659
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,559
optimize this with respect to the

1660
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,599
synthesis because the synthesis isn't in

1661
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,960
this Loop that is if I change the

1662
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:27,720
synthesis it doesn't change the output

1663
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:29,200
here so the gradient of this with

1664
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,520
respect to the synthesis is zero there

1665
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,599
is no gradient flow that goes back to

1666
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:37,039
the synthesis engine um but what yeld

1667
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:38,200
yelds um kind of aha moment was that I

1668
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:40,440
don't need to go into details about this

1669
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,400
but basically the the change in this

1670
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,520
with respect to the change in the

1671
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,760
weights is not zero and so if you keep

1672
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,559
around the weights from kind of the last

1673
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,640
gradient step you can flow the gradients

1674
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:51,280
back from real loss into the synthesis

1675
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:54,079
and now I can build a learnable residual

1676
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:57,799
Network that is an image I add to every

1677
00:58:54,079 --> 00:59:00,440
synthetic image that optimizes not the

1678
00:58:57,799 --> 00:59:03,280
synthetic loss but the real loss and

1679
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:06,160
critically these real labels never go

1680
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:09,119
into this network so this network has no

1681
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:11,559
ability to learn from the real labels

1682
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,079
all it's learning from is what to do to

1683
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:15,880
the synthetic data to optimize the

1684
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:17,119
accuracy on the real data okay and the

1685
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,240
reason I say that this is very different

1686
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,400
than optimizing the accuracy on the

1687
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,079
synthetic data because optimizing on the

1688
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,920
accuracy on the synthetic data would be

1689
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,480
easy right I just make it a binary image

1690
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,599
where my vessels are one and everything

1691
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:31,720
else is zero that's not what I want okay

1692
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:34,160
so this um Works astonishing well at

1693
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:37,680
least in early days this is again about

1694
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:40,079
a week old um but if we take um kind of

1695
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,599
a a standard synthesis and we train a

1696
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,880
segmentation Network we get a dice

1697
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:47,039
accuracy so this is this overlap here

1698
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:49,319
between the automated and the and the um

1699
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:50,760
predicted segmentations without the

1700
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:53,960
learn to synth stuff we get an accuracy

1701
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:55,400
of around 53 54 um and and this is a

1702
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,920
little bit of a straw man because I

1703
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,119
didn't I didn't tune this at all I

1704
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,400
didn't add noise to it I didn't do a lot

1705
00:59:58,119 --> 01:00:04,599
of augmentation I wanted that all in the

1706
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,559
synthesis Network um and it also I just

1707
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:08,079
kind of randomly we have should I should

1708
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:12,160
be pointing these out and I haven't been

1709
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:15,319
we have 7 64 cubes that have been

1710
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:18,760
manually annotated mostly by Caroline

1711
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:22,680
Manan but also by our interns um thank

1712
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:24,240
you interns for this thankless task um

1713
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,640
and what we found on the manual

1714
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:29,039
annotation side is that the only thing

1715
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,960
we can really do is segment very small

1716
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:33,119
blocks that is what I showed you earlier

1717
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,880
was like a 300 Cube we can't do 300

1718
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:38,240
cubes or too many vessels in it um and

1719
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,000
so we do either 32 cubed or 64 cubed and

1720
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,480
that's small enough that you can go

1721
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
through it exhaustively kind of time

1722
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,799
after time and try and find these two

1723
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,359
other structures that are and I think I

1724
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:48,280
happened to pick two that are pretty

1725
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:50,720
difficult for that ground Truth uh for

1726
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:53,000
the kind of standard um segmentation

1727
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:54,680
Network without the learn to syn so what

1728
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,680
does it look like these are what the

1729
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:59,079
results look like this is the manual

1730
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:00,640
annotation and again you can see kind

1731
01:00:59,079 --> 01:01:01,760
hard in the lights maybe like this

1732
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:04,440
should be one

1733
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,200
vessel but because the images are noisy

1734
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,319
this is what the images look like there

1735
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,640
are breaks in it in the manual

1736
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:09,720
annotation because the manual annotator

1737
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,880
kind of lost it for a little bit and

1738
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:14,160
then found it again this is what the the

1739
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,160
initial segmentation looks like and this

1740
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,559
is what it looks like without learn

1741
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,119
descent sorry with learn descent and so

1742
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:22,000
what is the learn descent doing if I go

1743
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:24,799
back here to the

1744
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:28,880
diagram I'm essentially learning an

1745
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:30,480
image that I add add to the initial

1746
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,000
synthetic image that I'm going to give

1747
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,480
to the network right so what is the

1748
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,640
image that I'm adding the initial

1749
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:39,400
synthetic image that makes the network

1750
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,400
more accurate on real

1751
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:44,559
data and this is pretty interesting so

1752
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:46,240
here's what the initial image look like

1753
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,319
so this is the initial synthetic image

1754
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,359
with the initial labels shown in blue

1755
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:52,200
hard to see the blue here this is it

1756
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:54,359
without the labels so this is the same

1757
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,480
image so these are vessels here this is

1758
01:01:54,359 --> 01:01:58,839
just noise these are synthetic

1759
01:01:55,480 --> 01:02:02,359
structures that are not vessels um the

1760
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:04,960
Learned residual it's like this I'll go

1761
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:06,599
back and forth and so what it looks like

1762
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,119
is like a photographic

1763
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:10,760
negative that is what it's learning to

1764
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,839
do is make life hard for the

1765
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,520
segmentation

1766
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:15,559
Network and so if I add them together

1767
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:17,039
this is now the input to the

1768
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:19,559
segmentation Network this very low

1769
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,880
contrast image and so again this is

1770
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:22,640
early days you know this is a result

1771
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,319
that's like a week old and I don't know

1772
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:28,079
that'll hold up but it seems like the

1773
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:30,520
answer is make life really hard for your

1774
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:31,720
networks during training and then your

1775
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,440
infrance will get

1776
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:35,440
better and there are a lot of things to

1777
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:38,000
be done in this like we we we very much

1778
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,400
want to add parametric variations so for

1779
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,920
example vessel caliber should be a

1780
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:42,640
learnable parameter what is the range of

1781
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,720
vessel calibers that optimizes the

1782
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,760
accuracy on real segmentation um because

1783
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,520
for example in the hip C we see all of

1784
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:50,319
the vessels we see vessels from like you

1785
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,599
know the 4 millim peel ones actually

1786
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:52,880
probably we've taken the PE surface off

1787
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,480
so we don't see that but you know

1788
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,440
millimeter scale vessels down to you

1789
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,359
know 10 Micron vessels um but in the o

1790
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,680
or the exor MRI we don't see the 10

1791
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,000
Micron vessels because our image

1792
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:04,319
resolution is

1793
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,400
120 so I think there's still many games

1794
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:08,359
to be played um and this is a

1795
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:12,000
quantification of so this is the

1796
01:03:08,359 --> 01:03:14,960
learning this is training across time so

1797
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,359
Epoch and this is sorry this is negative

1798
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,640
accuracy so down is better here for no

1799
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:21,920
very good reason except that I made the

1800
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:23,559
slide like two days ago um and so this

1801
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,559
is the accuracy on the synthetic data

1802
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:26,559
and this is the accuracy on the real

1803
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:29,079
data and what you can see is that the

1804
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:31,799
network learns to improve the accuracy

1805
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:34,119
on the real data about the time it

1806
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:36,359
learns to decrease the accuracy on

1807
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:39,240
synthetic data so it's kind of some

1808
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:41,200
quantification of of what I mentioned

1809
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:43,200
before okay that's it on the vessel

1810
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,640
segmentation

1811
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,640
stuff questions

1812
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,640
or

1813
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,319
yeah person to person oh man I wish I

1814
01:03:54,279 --> 01:03:57,000
knew the answer that question you know I

1815
01:03:56,319 --> 01:03:59,440
I

1816
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,319
think that's funny there was a when I

1817
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,000
was a post at MGH there was a post named

1818
01:04:01,319 --> 01:04:07,440
Rick hog who's now at Montreal and

1819
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,839
he he was very interested in Bas Imaging

1820
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,000
and he was like we should build an an

1821
01:04:08,839 --> 01:04:13,640
atlas of of like super Bas and you see

1822
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,599
how it varies from person to person and

1823
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:17,400
I was like that's a great idea you know

1824
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:22,039
that was 30 years ago and we haven't

1825
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:23,799
done it um and you know there are lots

1826
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:26,359
of basic unanswered questions about the

1827
01:04:23,799 --> 01:04:28,559
vure so for example do the vessels

1828
01:04:26,359 --> 01:04:29,680
follow the fical if we could segment the

1829
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,279
vessels would we know where the major

1830
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:33,960
fical are from the brain maybe I mean

1831
01:04:32,279 --> 01:04:35,279
you expect their supplying profusion

1832
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,480
like it might be that if we had a

1833
01:04:35,279 --> 01:04:38,240
vascular map we wouldn't need diffusion

1834
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,680
MRI we could just look at the vessels

1835
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,839
and know where the major tracts are I

1836
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:45,760
don't know you know do they do they

1837
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:47,839
delineate cortical areas um you know

1838
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:50,000
dioa did these India ink stands that

1839
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:51,400
that seem to show lots of vascular

1840
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,279
change in some regions you know a lot of

1841
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:56,000
it was V1 V2 and of course V1 changes

1842
01:04:54,279 --> 01:04:58,039
along every Dimension from every other

1843
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,720
area but it may be that the vasculature

1844
01:04:58,039 --> 01:05:01,279
tells us something about cortical areas

1845
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:03,279
like where are the boundaries between

1846
01:05:01,279 --> 01:05:04,520
this and that cortical area so the

1847
01:05:03,279 --> 01:05:05,640
answer is I don't know like I would love

1848
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,359
to know the answer to that question but

1849
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,799
I don't

1850
01:05:06,359 --> 01:05:11,119
know okay another question mentioned

1851
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:14,119
these white matter

1852
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:16,640
hyperintensities um I guess there's

1853
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:18,839
those are still kind of like oh sorry oh

1854
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:21,279
yeah you mentioned these white matter

1855
01:05:18,839 --> 01:05:23,079
hyperintensities which are still as far

1856
01:05:21,279 --> 01:05:24,680
as I understand kind of a mystery object

1857
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:26,200
and one of the theories is that they're

1858
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,200
vascular in

1859
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:31,359
that there's some kind of vascular

1860
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,799
defect what just curious what you think

1861
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:35,119
yeah let me start by saying I am I am

1862
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:36,880
absolutely 100% not an expert on this

1863
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,480
but you know I have like spent time

1864
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:42,559
close to some experts so I know a little

1865
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:44,480
bit just from like EES dropping um so I

1866
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:48,119
think that there are different kinds you

1867
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:50,079
know when we look at these lesions on Mr

1868
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:51,520
sometimes they're like a little on a T1

1869
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,319
weighted Mr they look a little darker or

1870
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,880
a little brighter on a a T2 or flare or

1871
01:05:53,319 --> 01:05:56,920
something but sometimes they're like

1872
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,720
black holes and I think those are

1873
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:00,039
probably have different Origins I think

1874
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,319
the black holes are probably like dead

1875
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:04,160
tissue um whereas the other ones maybe

1876
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:07,400
you know some inflammation I also think

1877
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:08,880
that they they change in different so

1878
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,000
like in Ms we see them and that probably

1879
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,039
is different than the ones we see in

1880
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,240
aging and Alzheimer's um but in the end

1881
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:14,400
I don't I don't know that we know the

1882
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:17,279
answer to that you know one of the

1883
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,520
things that like Dirk Keen was excited

1884
01:06:17,279 --> 01:06:20,880
about when we first started this whole

1885
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:23,039
project is we can find them where them

1886
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,599
are like for the neuropath they're hard

1887
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,920
to study because you don't know where

1888
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:28,559
they are you don't see them on the slab

1889
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,880
but we see them in Mr and then we can

1890
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:31,200
project that onto the slab and then you

1891
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,319
can go and take that out and look at it

1892
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,880
and in fact we did that with the case I

1893
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:35,520
showed you it's just the neuropath

1894
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:37,079
wasn't very interesting in that case so

1895
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,079
we we don't typically show neuropath

1896
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:41,680
findings for that but the techniques are

1897
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:43,000
all in place to do that like use the Mr

1898
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,559
as a spotlight to tell the

1899
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,839
neuropathologist something's going on

1900
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:48,440
here can you check it

1901
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:51,319
out you could find a slab with one and

1902
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:53,799
then go in and dissect it straight to it

1903
01:06:51,319 --> 01:06:56,599
yeah yeah I mean the the one caveat is

1904
01:06:53,799 --> 01:06:58,200
that we typically need

1905
01:06:56,599 --> 01:07:00,119
do the best that we can do we typically

1906
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:02,400
need some type of image of the whole

1907
01:07:00,119 --> 01:07:05,440
brain um whether it's photos of every

1908
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,839
slab or an MR before it was taken out or

1909
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,200
or a 3D surface scan like once you

1910
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:12,279
remove parts of the brain we can no

1911
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:14,440
longer recover the topology of it and

1912
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:16,599
topology is a pretty strong constraint

1913
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:21,240
um so that that helps us a

1914
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:23,880
lot okay okay on to individual level

1915
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:26,160
stuff okay so let me go back to this so

1916
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,880
here we would like to increase the level

1917
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,680
of details for years we we've done

1918
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:33,960
anatomical modeling of you know Cate

1919
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:36,160
paman and and hippocampus and Miga and

1920
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,520
we've extended that to things like um

1921
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,200
you know subfields in the in the

1922
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,480
hippocampus May nuclei but we would like

1923
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,880
to extend it in individual subjects that

1924
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,240
we're doing this type of highr Imaging

1925
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:47,720
on so that we're not just saying it's in

1926
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:50,760
you know the frontal lobe but we're

1927
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:53,760
saying it's in layer three of Robin area

1928
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:56,359
44 for example and so we've been trying

1929
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,200
to extend the scope and level of detail

1930
01:07:56,359 --> 01:08:00,559
of our models to kind of incorporate

1931
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:04,240
these mesoscale anatomical features into

1932
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:05,960
them um and this is work that um tell

1933
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:07,640
Zang has done where we've done some

1934
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,440
manual labeling I will again thank

1935
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,720
interns because interns were involved in

1936
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:14,440
manual labeling here um so the game we

1937
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:17,440
play here is we do we image the entire

1938
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:20,279
hemisphere at 120 Micron we project our

1939
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:23,279
inv Vivo estimate of where area 4445 is

1940
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:25,679
Brokers area um I'll explain how I do

1941
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,520
that in a little bit um and then we a

1942
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:30,000
block out we do the O we do the light

1943
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,759
sheet Imaging um and so we would like to

1944
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,799
start analyzing not just the G matter as

1945
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:38,920
a whole but layers within the cortex and

1946
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:40,159
on the XMR if you can appreciate it here

1947
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,839
we see the boundary between

1948
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:43,640
infragranular and supergranular cortex

1949
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:44,960
almost everywhere it's a pretty Salient

1950
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:46,960
feature you know there's theories about

1951
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,000
how they developed separately and came

1952
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,400
together and this and that um but for us

1953
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,759
it's a feature we can see across the

1954
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:56,560
whole brain and we can manually annotate

1955
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:58,359
it um and so we've done

1956
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,080
let's see how many so this was 15 I

1957
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:02,120
think we're up to about 20 now where we

1958
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,759
have hemispheres manually annotated

1959
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:07,839
infragranular supergranular cortex in

1960
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:09,080
brokus area we also have two hemis where

1961
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:11,640
we've done kind of a scattering of

1962
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:13,799
slices elsewhere and this is a huge

1963
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,920
amount of data 120 Micron across the

1964
01:09:13,799 --> 01:09:17,239
hemisphere um you know at at one

1965
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,640
millimeter we get you know something

1966
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:20,640
like a million voxels in the brain so at

1967
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,679
120 Micron we would get like a thousand

1968
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:25,799
times that I guess so it's a lot of data

1969
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:28,560
and it's not feasible to manually anate

1970
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:30,000
the whole thing and so we've been trying

1971
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,560
to develop techniques and by we I

1972
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,600
completely Mean Taylor whose idea this

1973
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:37,239
was um techniques that use manual labels

1974
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:40,719
where they're available so supervised

1975
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:43,159
training but also benefit from the rest

1976
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:46,480
of the data set where there aren't any

1977
01:09:43,159 --> 01:09:48,319
labels um right and Taylor estimated

1978
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:49,880
that it would take like 20 years to take

1979
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,560
our existing Personnel to label every

1980
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:56,719
slice and every brain and none of us are

1981
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:59,280
that patient um okay I see this the next

1982
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:01,560
slide yes okay so the way this works so

1983
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:03,360
Taylor developed a technique that's

1984
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,280
semi-supervised that is it uses the

1985
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,760
labels and label regions but it uses the

1986
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:09,920
unlabeled data as well and the way it

1987
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,960
works is this thing called uh cross

1988
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,520
pseudo supervision which is one of these

1989
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:16,719
deep learning things that I would never

1990
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:18,840
have thought would work and the game he

1991
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:21,080
plays is that instead of training a

1992
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,600
single Network you train like a little

1993
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:25,040
uh Sibling Group of networks like three

1994
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:27,080
of them at the same time and you sample

1995
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:30,000
of box from the brain and you say is

1996
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:31,880
that voxel a labeled voxel if it's a

1997
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,159
labeled voxel I'll train all my networks

1998
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:36,320
on a label if the networks make a

1999
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:37,920
mistake I'll penalize them but if they

2000
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:40,400
make the same mistake I'll really

2001
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:42,080
penalize them like so it's what he calls

2002
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,199
an error diversity term that is he wants

2003
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:46,760
the networks not to become one network

2004
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:49,000
he wants them to learn different things

2005
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:51,320
then if if he samples outside of the

2006
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,719
labeled region he has each Network train

2007
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:56,280
the other and so there's no ground truth

2008
01:10:53,719 --> 01:10:57,120
out there um

2009
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,480
and I would have thought this thing

2010
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,040
would converge to nothing very

2011
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:02,880
interesting but in fact that's not true

2012
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:04,199
in fact it works um here's an example of

2013
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,080
a whole hemisphere

2014
01:11:04,199 --> 01:11:07,840
segmentation here's the quantification

2015
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,719
of it um so these are different cortical

2016
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,040
areas these are our estimates of what

2017
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:14,239
broadman area we're in um this is ENT

2018
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:16,199
rhal this is V1 and V2 and you don't

2019
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:18,080
have to look at all of these U but the

2020
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:19,400
interesting ones are this so the other

2021
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,719
thing I'll add is that this is a multi

2022
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:24,159
resolution unit Cascade so we give the

2023
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:27,360
whole data set at low resolution to the

2024
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:30,840
first unit and then the second unit

2025
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:32,440
looks at uh two-fold upsampling uh and

2026
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,600
also gets the whole brain context and

2027
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,000
and the next one is another twofold

2028
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,960
uping until we get to the original data

2029
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,880
resolution and so the last unit has the

2030
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:43,920
benefit of the whole brain context plus

2031
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:45,719
the highest resolution we get to um

2032
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:48,000
anyway so that's shown here in purple um

2033
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:50,000
NN unit it's kind of a popular Baseline

2034
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,120
that people use and so you can see that

2035
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,760
most of our labels are in 4445 and they

2036
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:56,880
all do pretty well there you know 4445

2037
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:58,719
has its own architecture it's it's five

2038
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,440
layer cortex there's no layer FL it's a

2039
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:04,600
granular um and so if you take this

2040
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:07,080
network train there and run it in V1 or

2041
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:08,560
V2 it completely fails because it's an

2042
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,560
architecture it's never seen it's atic

2043
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,840
architecture that's just different

2044
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:13,760
enough in the training set um but the

2045
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,440
cross of supervision keeps this accuracy

2046
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:19,639
pretty high and so we now have tools

2047
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:20,920
that in the x 120 Micron XMR do a very

2048
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:23,120
accurate job at labeling infragranular

2049
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:26,120
and super granular and probably we're

2050
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:28,360
not going to do a lot more not clear but

2051
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:30,639
we we don't see six layer many places at

2052
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:33,400
120 M we see it some places but we see

2053
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:36,159
it everywhere in the light sheet data

2054
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:39,280
and Patrick Hoff and the group in lens

2055
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:40,840
Iran costantini are generating Manual

2056
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:43,199
labelings of all six cortical layers

2057
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:46,480
that we're going to look at but so how

2058
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:48,000
much use is this if we can generate

2059
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:50,800
accurate infragranular supergranular

2060
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,560
segmentations on 120 Micron xvo data

2061
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,719
when we're not going to get 120 microns

2062
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:57,239
in Vivo anytime soon you know if we

2063
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:59,280
struggle like crazy we can get I don't

2064
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:01,159
know 4 Micron like that's a long scan

2065
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:03,600
it's very sensitive to motion it's very

2066
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:05,360
difficult to get beyond that resolution

2067
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,239
in Vivo and even 400 microns is really

2068
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,480
pushing it and so what we've been doing

2069
01:13:07,239 --> 01:13:11,920
and this is O's work is we've been

2070
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:13,440
looking at how accurately we can predict

2071
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,320
these boundaries in the absence of

2072
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,960
Imaging

2073
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:20,520
data that is if I can tell you at this

2074
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:23,280
point in the brain the layer 4 boundary

2075
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,760
is always 1.3 mm from the gray white

2076
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,520
boundary I don't need to see the

2077
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:29,719
contrast I know where the boundary is

2078
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,760
and so here's an example I'll go through

2079
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:33,880
the details what this means so the let's

2080
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:36,520
see which is which the ground truth

2081
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:38,639
is yellow so the yellow is the one that

2082
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:40,040
was generated by the manual labeling and

2083
01:13:38,639 --> 01:13:41,560
then the green and the red are two

2084
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:44,480
different cortical two two different

2085
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:47,000
more two different models of cortical

2086
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:49,560
folding formation one is called ISO

2087
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,159
volume one is called ISO distance and

2088
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,760
essentially they're used to to estimate

2089
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:55,719
the orientation of columns and how far

2090
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,480
out the cortex uh different bound

2091
01:13:55,719 --> 01:13:58,840
boundaries are from each other and they

2092
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:02,480
both fit reasonably well probably the

2093
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,000
iso volume if we just do a single fit a

2094
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:06,000
single parameter of the whole brain ISO

2095
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,719
volume is probably a little bit better

2096
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,040
um but if we do a vertex-wise fit that

2097
01:14:07,719 --> 01:14:12,080
is if every point in the brain we fit an

2098
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:13,159
ISO volume and an ISO distance model

2099
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,440
that's what's shown here this is an

2100
01:14:13,159 --> 01:14:17,199
error map this is the distribution of

2101
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:20,280
Errors they're about the same so vertex

2102
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:23,159
wise you know if we if we use our 17ish

2103
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:24,760
subjects to fit the models at every

2104
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:26,520
point in the brain we can do a pretty

2105
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:28,840
good job but predicting the

2106
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:30,080
infragranular super granular border uh

2107
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,159
and whether we use an isog distence or

2108
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,400
that's the volume doesn't really matter

2109
01:14:31,159 --> 01:14:35,520
very much but more importantly if I fit

2110
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,880
a fit a full linear model just based on

2111
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,800
Geometry so T here is the thickness of

2112
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,880
the cortex K1 and K2 are the principal

2113
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:43,239
curvatures and so here this is a linear

2114
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:46,159
model you know I want to recover these

2115
01:14:43,239 --> 01:14:47,760
betas um at every point in the brain we

2116
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:50,120
can do an excellent job at predicting

2117
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:52,400
where the infragranular border is so you

2118
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:54,639
know what is this like the mode is

2119
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:57,000
around a tenth of a millimeter you know

2120
01:14:54,639 --> 01:14:58,480
and this so so if we can generate

2121
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,159
accurate surface models we can predict

2122
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,760
where the boundary is even if we can't

2123
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:03,679
see any contrast that separate super

2124
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,199
granular from

2125
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:08,679
ular um we have a question online Bruce

2126
01:15:06,199 --> 01:15:10,520
if you don't mind um so the question is

2127
01:15:08,679 --> 01:15:12,400
can the can the approach your group

2128
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:14,239
developed for training on synthetic data

2129
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:16,199
for brain mapping be applied to other

2130
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:17,960
organs like the heart and what

2131
01:15:16,199 --> 01:15:19,960
challenges might arise in translating

2132
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:23,440
these methods to other

2133
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:25,920
systems uh the answer is yes I mean so

2134
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,400
the so the shape stuff is not organ

2135
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,000
specific it's completely synthetic um

2136
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,000
you know cardiac deformations are a lot

2137
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,040
bigger than cross- subject variability

2138
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
in the brain so I expect there's some

2139
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,560
tuning that would have to be done I

2140
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
think Kiara has applied The Vessel stuff

2141
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:42,679
to non-brain data I think she applied it

2142
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,159
to some kidney data I think I'm not sure

2143
01:15:42,679 --> 01:15:45,080
so in principle yes in practice we

2144
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:49,360
haven't done a lot of it because we're

2145
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:50,679
so brain Centric okay okay so we have

2146
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:52,480
put this whole thing together at least

2147
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:54,000
on the individual subject basis well

2148
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,080
we've we've acquired light sheet data

2149
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,400
we've acquired stained data we've

2150
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,600
acquired OCT we've acquired Mr we've

2151
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:00,560
registered the whole thing we put it

2152
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:02,960
into the same coordinate system uh and

2153
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:06,040
now I'll show you a fairly gratuitous

2154
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:09,440
fly through just to so that's the Mr

2155
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:12,080
that's 120 Micron Mr that's the 55

2156
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:15,000
Micron Mr From the Block this is the

2157
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:17,040
three Micron ooc and then we zoom into a

2158
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,639
nissl state in in motor cortex where we

2159
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:21,280
can see you know every neuron in motor

2160
01:16:19,639 --> 01:16:24,040
cortex and then we could start to

2161
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:26,920
quantify this stuff oops done Play It

2162
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:26,920
Again

2163
01:16:27,639 --> 01:16:31,639
we can start to quantify this stuff um

2164
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,000
this is so the stereology was done by

2165
01:16:31,639 --> 01:16:35,159
Patrick Hoff the light sheet was done at

2166
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,199
Lens the oct was acquired locally

2167
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:40,920
probably by David buz but possibly by k

2168
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:43,040
w um but we can project this light sheet

2169
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:45,600
data through the OC so here's the light

2170
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:47,000
sheet data through the registered o or

2171
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,199
rather the registered light sheet data

2172
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,639
to the O and then back out to the Mr we

2173
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:52,520
have cortical surface models of

2174
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:54,040
different layers in the cortex and we

2175
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,840
could start to make maps so this heat

2176
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:58,159
map is basically stereology at different

2177
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,560
layers on the cortical surface so this

2178
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:01,760
is all the way out the PE surface so

2179
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:04,320
think layer one and then down here to

2180
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,679
layer six and so we can count uh I think

2181
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,080
this is new n yeah so this is like all

2182
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:09,080
neurons so how many neurons are there in

2183
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:10,960
layer one this bit of the cortex in a

2184
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:13,320
human

2185
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,679
brain okay almost at the end any

2186
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:17,080
questions on

2187
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:19,440
that no okay so I'm going to talk about

2188
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:21,719
individual subject stuff

2189
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:25,040
um so there are a series of papers

2190
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:28,880
published in the N late 90s early 2000s

2191
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:32,400
um by um this is actual sler paper but

2192
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:34,239
mostly by um katr and the late great

2193
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:36,600
Carl zillis who was an amazing neur

2194
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:38,679
anatomist who died a few years ago and

2195
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:40,480
they developed this te technique they

2196
01:17:38,679 --> 01:17:41,760
called Observer independent 2D histology

2197
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:44,600
so this is a photo micrograph of a

2198
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:47,120
nissle stain every dark spot is a neuron

2199
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:49,440
they they fit the surface the gray white

2200
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:51,840
surface the peel surface they solve the

2201
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:54,320
CL equation that gives them a streamline

2202
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,520
connecting the two and then they built

2203
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,920
what they called a GLI which is a

2204
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:58,120
greater level index and basically it

2205
01:17:56,920 --> 01:18:00,159
says how many neurons would there at

2206
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:03,000
this spot in the brain and they built a

2207
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:05,040
technique that looked at changes in this

2208
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,480
GLI so these Peaks are changes in the

2209
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:10,800
GLI um that represent potential

2210
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:12,719
boundaries in the data so where's the V1

2211
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,960
V2 border where's the V2 V3 border at

2212
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:16,520
this kind of Point um they published a

2213
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,320
series of quite influential papers in

2214
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:20,360
the 90s looking at this in various

2215
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,840
cortical areas and they used it to try

2216
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,880
and characterize human

2217
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:25,639
variability and there was a set of

2218
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,719
papers this these are I guess two of

2219
01:18:25,639 --> 01:18:30,880
katrin's papers looking at Robin area 17

2220
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:34,800
18 44 and 45 uh and generally the

2221
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:37,520
conclusion was that the micro structure

2222
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:40,159
is variable in ways we don't have access

2223
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,920
to using macro structure that is we

2224
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:44,080
can't use micr structure to predict micr

2225
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:46,440
structure boundaries um and they

2226
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:49,000
quantify this so this is V1 this is a

2227
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:50,639
heat map so red means they have 10

2228
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,639
neurologically normal subjects that come

2229
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:54,920
to autopsy they do unbelievable amounts

2230
01:18:52,639 --> 01:18:57,239
to work of work to generate this stuff

2231
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:59,560
um red means all 10 subjects agreed that

2232
01:18:57,239 --> 01:19:01,920
this spot was V1 you know and yellow is

2233
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:04,080
whatever this is six subjects agreed so

2234
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:05,360
even in V1 which is the most

2235
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:07,400
architectonically stable feature of the

2236
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:09,040
brain it's always in the Cochran sulcus

2237
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:10,440
it has you know one of the few

2238
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:13,840
architectonic features we can see with a

2239
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:15,840
NE neg ey the of jari even in V1 there's

2240
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,400
this tiny little dot in the middle where

2241
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:19,760
all 10 subjects agree in this coordinate

2242
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:22,520
system so this tar is a kind

2243
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:25,159
of was a standard coordinate system in

2244
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:27,320
neuroimaging um it's less so now now

2245
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:29,960
anyway even in V1 in this coordinate

2246
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:32,040
system the v1s don't line up like my 10

2247
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,639
subjects don't overlap that much and I

2248
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:35,320
go one step up in the cortical hierarchy

2249
01:19:33,639 --> 01:19:36,520
and I don't have any red like majority

2250
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:38,360
distribution is like four or five

2251
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:43,080
subjects and then I get out to language

2252
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:45,400
cortex 44 and 45 and this blue means no

2253
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,679
two subjects agreed like every spot was

2254
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:49,679
in a different cortical area in a

2255
01:19:46,679 --> 01:19:52,639
different subject um so krin was kind

2256
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:54,920
enough to give us that her data uh we do

2257
01:19:52,639 --> 01:19:56,800
registration differently in the brain we

2258
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:59,360
don't use image intensities we use

2259
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:01,639
geometry so this is kind of a an outline

2260
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:03,679
of what we do we have surface models of

2261
01:20:01,639 --> 01:20:05,440
each subject this is for subjects we map

2262
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,400
these surface models onto the sphere so

2263
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:09,920
these red green patterns red this the

2264
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:11,600
central sulcus uh the red are folded in

2265
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,520
the green are folded out and then the

2266
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,600
game we'll play is to extract summary

2267
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:17,120
statistics across subjects and shift

2268
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,679
these red green patterns around on the

2269
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:22,880
surface of the sphere until they line up

2270
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:25,159
so that I can and I get a different a

2271
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,239
diff morphic transform with of these I

2272
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:29,280
can go out here and then back out to any

2273
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:31,719
individual subject and it's a coordinate

2274
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:33,600
system that kind of maps it normalizes

2275
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:36,480
out the variability of anatomy we see in

2276
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:38,560
cortical foldings okay so this is fairly

2277
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,239
old at this point I don't have a

2278
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:42,080
citation I have a citation I don't have

2279
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:43,880
a citation uh we published this I don't

2280
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:46,400
know 10 years ago or so where we got

2281
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:48,280
krin's data we did the exact same thing

2282
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:50,320
I changed color scales I'm sorry so this

2283
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:53,159
this means 100% is all 10 subjects

2284
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:56,159
agreed and gray means um no two subjects

2285
01:20:53,159 --> 01:20:57,679
agreed we did the same study we just

2286
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:59,239
analyzed the data mapped it to to

2287
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:00,520
surfaces registered the surfaces and

2288
01:20:59,239 --> 01:21:02,480
counted how often the subjects agree

2289
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:04,560
this is V1 or V2 or whatever and when

2290
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:06,520
you can see is that in V1 cortical

2291
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:09,040
geometry is a perfect predictor for the

2292
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:10,600
architectonic boundary of V1 V2 this

2293
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:13,400
isn't surprising like we know V1 isn't

2294
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:15,880
the Cal uh in V2 it's still quite good

2295
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:17,440
and even if I get out to 44 and 45 you

2296
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,960
know there's some variability here

2297
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,600
there's this large core of the area

2298
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:23,320
where we're 100% certain in this

2299
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:24,600
architectonic region and so we have some

2300
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:29,080
confidence that we can predict AR

2301
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:31,400
tectonic identity um just from geometry

2302
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:33,199
um we replicated this so this is a

2303
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:35,000
photomicrograph of a nissle stain so

2304
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:36,520
this is the pl surface this is the white

2305
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,840
M boundary and control subject this is

2306
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:41,920
an Alzheimer subject in entor rinal

2307
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:44,120
cortex ENT rinal is devastated in early

2308
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:46,159
ad this is an this is like the earliest

2309
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:48,159
clinical clinically diagnosable form of

2310
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:51,360
AD and 60% of these neurons are dead in

2311
01:21:48,159 --> 01:21:54,199
ler to an rhal we went looking for an

2312
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:56,760
rhal cortex with XMR this is 100 Micron

2313
01:21:54,199 --> 01:21:58,960
X in the mle tempor lobe and you can see

2314
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:00,960
oh sorry I should mention back to this

2315
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,239
aninal has this bizarre architecture

2316
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:04,679
these aninal

2317
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:06,719
islands there know cell dense clumps and

2318
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:09,360
then like a 250 Micron cell po area and

2319
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,719
another cell Clump um as far as I know

2320
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,520
this this architecture doesn't occur

2321
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:14,600
anywhere else in the human brain we went

2322
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:17,280
looking for them with xar here they are

2323
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:19,120
in XR these little bright spots uh and

2324
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:21,120
this let us find the boundaries and say

2325
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:22,679
are they predictable with Mr and the

2326
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:25,239
answer is yes we can predict where

2327
01:22:22,679 --> 01:22:26,639
aninal cortex is and further further we

2328
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:28,000
can take this data and map it to

2329
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:30,560
alzheimer's data this was Data Randy

2330
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:32,880
Buckner gave me um and we can predict

2331
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:34,760
where anal cortex is and see if there's

2332
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:36,360
thinning and so this is the thickness of

2333
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:38,239
the cortex controls this is the

2334
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:40,040
thickness in Alzheimer subjects and so

2335
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:41,560
you can already see there's dramatic

2336
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:43,760
reduction in cortical thickness in these

2337
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:45,840
very mild aler subjects and if I take

2338
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:48,600
this Roi and I translate just a

2339
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,679
posterior a centimeter posterior this

2340
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,880
effect goes away so it's not widespread

2341
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:53,400
thinning across the whole brain it's

2342
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,520
actually in this predicted architect

2343
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:57,480
region

2344
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:59,639
we'll skip this okay so we would like to

2345
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,520
establish a common coordinate framework

2346
01:22:59,639 --> 01:23:04,880
um that does cross optic alignment of

2347
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:06,159
some relevant properties what properties

2348
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,440
we would like to do it even if we can't

2349
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:10,679
directly observe them at inference time

2350
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,920
um JS I won't talk about and then we

2351
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:13,120
would like to be able to extract summary

2352
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:14,239
statistics you know what's the average

2353
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,840
human look like in this in this

2354
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:17,880
coordinate

2355
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:20,080
system so what properties would we like

2356
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,800
to align well there are a lot of them we

2357
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,239
like to line side architecture and my

2358
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:25,239
architecture and Vaso architecture and

2359
01:23:23,239 --> 01:23:27,120
you know the vasculature and

2360
01:23:25,239 --> 01:23:29,080
you know molecular properties and

2361
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,440
geometry Etc but we don't even know if

2362
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,280
this is possible we have no way to get

2363
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:34,880
these things line up with each

2364
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:36,880
other so how can we improve on what

2365
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,120
we've already done well we we tried this

2366
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,560
years ago Paulina and I with Thomas yo

2367
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:43,760
who was a grad student who's now back in

2368
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:45,199
Singapore and meru who's in um at

2369
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:49,840
Cornell

2370
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:51,199
um Cornel Tech uh and the idea was that

2371
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,239
maybe all folds aren't equally

2372
01:23:51,199 --> 01:23:54,600
predictive of all areas I mean it's not

2373
01:23:53,239 --> 01:23:56,600
it's not a deep idea like we know that

2374
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:58,040
calc is predictive of V1 but can we

2375
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:00,639
build a computational framework that'll

2376
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:02,239
let us extract this information and so

2377
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:05,679
the idea here and this is Andrew Lee's

2378
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:07,280
work is can we train a deep Network that

2379
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:08,639
is given a map of cortical folding

2380
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,960
patterns and you tell the network I want

2381
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:11,360
you to align the folding patterns like

2382
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,080
this is what the network sees these are

2383
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,920
the things that go through the

2384
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:15,760
convolutions but I also want you to

2385
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,560
align this other thing and I'm not going

2386
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,639
to show you the other thing I'm just

2387
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:21,719
going to tell you how well you did right

2388
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:23,639
so think you know I'm going to use FM as

2389
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:26,280
an example but it could be anything it

2390
01:24:23,639 --> 01:24:29,679
could be mapa areas it could be you know

2391
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:30,639
um some proteomic image whatever so you

2392
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:32,080
give it the folding patterns it

2393
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:33,800
generates an alignment you apply that

2394
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,360
alignment to some other pair of images

2395
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:37,679
and then you tell the network no your

2396
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:40,239
thing sucked do it again uh and so the

2397
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:41,800
only way it can solve this problem is by

2398
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:43,119
building a predictive model of the thing

2399
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,320
it doesn't see from the thing it does

2400
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:47,440
see right so it has to learn to predict

2401
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:49,119
this unseen feature set from the feature

2402
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:50,960
set it

2403
01:24:49,119 --> 01:24:53,840
sees

2404
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:55,920
uh yeah maybe I'll skip this one I'll

2405
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,679
just add that we also learn an atlas at

2406
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,199
the same time so we don't register to an

2407
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:01,440
atlas but we extract an atlas from the

2408
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:03,400
data set of both the Unseen feature set

2409
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:04,719
and the seen feature set over the course

2410
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:07,280
of

2411
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:10,159
learning um and this is an example um so

2412
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:14,080
this is stuff from evina federenko and

2413
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:15,199
Greta who defended like two hours ago so

2414
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,280
I hope it went well for her I didn't get

2415
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:18,480
to go to her defense because it was

2416
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:21,440
today uh and so this is human language

2417
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:23,679
fmri and human language fmri Studies

2418
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:25,639
have suffered from the fact that

2419
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:26,920
functional area in the language networks

2420
01:25:25,639 --> 01:25:29,119
don't line up across subjects from a

2421
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,360
long time for a long time that is I do

2422
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:33,400
an FM study of a bunch of subjects I get

2423
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,639
robust activation in everyone I line

2424
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:37,080
them up in some common coordinate system

2425
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:39,199
and I get nothing and so this has made

2426
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:40,400
life difficult here's an example so you

2427
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:41,880
know you usually get these like three

2428
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:44,760
areas in frontal cortex and then we get

2429
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:47,080
this broad swath temporally um this is

2430
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:48,400
an average that we do that we made with

2431
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:50,760
kind of our standard registration tools

2432
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:53,080
you can see that despite these robust

2433
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:55,239
activations I don't see anything there

2434
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:57,159
um but what's interesting is if I look

2435
01:25:55,239 --> 01:25:58,639
at every one of these subjects there's

2436
01:25:57,159 --> 01:26:00,880
like a little divot here it's actually

2437
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:03,960
not a divot it's a fold out so this is

2438
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:06,639
the precentral cus this is the middle

2439
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:10,080
frontal gyrus and there's this little

2440
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:12,320
Interruption here in like every subject

2441
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:15,560
that has a functional activation when

2442
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:17,159
you do a language task right but we lose

2443
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:19,480
that because it's a small feature it's

2444
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:21,600
variable it doesn't line up and so when

2445
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:23,000
we do geometry based alignment we lose

2446
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,320
that feature and it doesn't line up

2447
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
across subjects and so the underlying

2448
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:29,040
functional activation that was there

2449
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:32,440
doesn't line up but we can learn to line

2450
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:33,840
it up whoops I'm too many um and so this

2451
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,040
is kind of our standard registration

2452
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,719
this is with this learned Atlas and

2453
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:39,320
learned registration and you can see it

2454
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:41,960
recovers this these kind of three spots

2455
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:45,159
um quite nicely and so this works for FM

2456
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:48,119
but it could work for any unseen feature

2457
01:26:45,159 --> 01:26:51,679
set okay and that that's all I tried to

2458
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:52,960
mention people um as I went through a

2459
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:54,679
lot of people contributed to a lot of

2460
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:57,320
this I also wanted to say thank you to

2461
01:26:54,679 --> 01:26:59,880
our interns so this was our fall 2024

2462
01:26:57,320 --> 01:27:03,520
cohort um from lots of places in the

2463
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:07,360
area this was the spring

2464
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:09,320
20241 this was 2023 and 2021 we did it

2465
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:10,800
in 2020 which was a crazy time as you

2466
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,719
might imagine um and we don't have

2467
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,199
pictures from that uh and then I also

2468
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:16,639
wanted to thank uh R and regini who are

2469
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:19,280
the ones that run the internship uh

2470
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:21,159
Julie who's copi with me of the r25 that

2471
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:23,159
funds A lot of it and Allison who

2472
01:27:21,159 --> 01:27:24,199
basically makes everything happen um as

2473
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:25,400
I think you guys know we have a

2474
01:27:24,199 --> 01:27:26,960
partnership with My Brother's Keeper

2475
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:29,239
which is down the street and they're the

2476
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:31,159
ones that really helped us do this uh

2477
01:27:29,239 --> 01:27:33,040
and then Sarah Who's involved early on

2478
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:34,800
is still involved and enormous help and

2479
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,960
Ted across the street and then I want to

2480
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:39,520
thank Kiku who if you don't know uh was

2481
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:42,520
chair of the pp working group which is a

2482
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:44,239
typically thankless task anyway so thank

2483
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:45,600
you Kiku for doing that I know that it

2484
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:47,400
doesn't help your career in any way so

2485
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:50,560
it was a kind thing to do and that's all

2486
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:50,560
thank you

2487
01:27:55,119 --> 01:27:58,520
any other questions now that we've come

2488
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,520
to the

2489
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:09,119
end yeah I'm curious to know I'm curious

2490
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:11,440
to know if you've identified any spatial

2491
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:13,679
variations in gene expression that kind

2492
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:16,400
of help your models oh man you guys have

2493
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:17,760
to tell us that uh no so we don't have

2494
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:20,360
that data yet I mean I think Allan is

2495
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:23,080
trying to get that data um but no we

2496
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:25,520
have very you know we've been working on

2497
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:28,239
the kind of glue glue infrastructure for

2498
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:30,480
this stuff um and the glue is just

2499
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:33,080
starting to dry I'm going to take that

2500
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:34,080
metaphor too far um but so no we haven't

2501
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,320
applied it I don't think there's much

2502
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:39,760
data on that yet but what would be your

2503
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:43,119
best bet on um this Imaging phenotype

2504
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:44,840
could be linked tightly to the spatial

2505
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:48,000
or any any type of gene expression no no

2506
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:50,199
it's an interesting question I know that

2507
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:51,679
um I remember giving a talk so I wish

2508
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:54,320
Randy Buckner was here um I remember

2509
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:57,520
giving a talk once showing like how we

2510
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:59,040
can parate frontal cortex and rany's

2511
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,880
response was I don't think there are any

2512
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:03,080
areas in frontal cortex it's just like a

2513
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,119
broad slow gradient like there are no

2514
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:06,239
sharp

2515
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:08,239
boundaries maybe he's right I don't know

2516
01:29:06,239 --> 01:29:09,480
maybe's not wrong very often um but

2517
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:12,400
maybe he's wrong like we just don't know

2518
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:13,920
we don't have that data and so you know

2519
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,679
it is astonishing to me that here we're

2520
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,199
almost in 2025 and there's the stuff we

2521
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:20,719
don't know like we we've segment

2522
01:29:18,199 --> 01:29:22,560
broadman areas 4445 is it really a

2523
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:24,360
cortical area does it have different

2524
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,560
functional properties you know most that

2525
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:28,159
stuff is from like vascular lesion

2526
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:30,040
studies done in the 1800s or we just

2527
01:29:28,159 --> 01:29:32,159
don't know um and so one of the things

2528
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:36,719
that I think is exciting about Bon ban

2529
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:37,920
is is this real push to start to build

2530
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:39,320
the infrastructure needed to answer

2531
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,840
these basic questions that have such

2532
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:42,760
implications for you know how we treat

2533
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:45,239
diseases you know how the normal human

2534
01:29:42,760 --> 01:29:46,960
brain works um and I wish I had an

2535
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:50,960
answer to that one but I

2536
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,960
don't yeah

2537
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:58,520
so you you mentioned this really

2538
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:00,600
interesting work you guys are doing in

2539
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:02,880
that project of like functional Imaging

2540
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:04,960
near the end of life and then kind of

2541
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:08,719
having that functional Imaging guide the

2542
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:09,920
dissection of the samples yep so um I

2543
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:12,639
guess I had two questions about that one

2544
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,880
is is there are you guys doing any other

2545
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:16,520
measurements near the end of life like

2546
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:20,000
cognitive measurements or things like

2547
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:22,280
that that could then be correlated to

2548
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,679
the functional data that's a good

2549
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:26,400
question my guess is not very much I

2550
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:27,639
mean are very sick people yeah and so

2551
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:30,239
it's not clear they can tolerate the

2552
01:30:27,639 --> 01:30:33,199
Imaging know even the Imaging

2553
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:34,840
itself you know we're very parsimonious

2554
01:30:33,199 --> 01:30:36,320
with what data we're going to try and

2555
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:38,719
get because they're not going to be able

2556
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:40,360
to tolerate very much so there may be

2557
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:41,600
some of that going on um but I don't

2558
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:43,440
know so that would be a question for

2559
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,400
people that you dub and have you have

2560
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:47,920
you guys as a team yet been able to test

2561
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:52,320
the hypothesis that the

2562
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:54,880
Imaging um Imaging guided dissection

2563
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:56,960
gives you sort of like more similar

2564
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,679
molecular results than if you hadn't

2565
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,800
done than if you had just sort of done

2566
01:30:58,679 --> 01:31:03,360
it U

2567
01:31:00,800 --> 01:31:06,360
naively definitely not I'm trying to

2568
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,239
think how we would even do that um it's

2569
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,840
hard because we don't know what the

2570
01:31:07,239 --> 01:31:10,920
answer is to like we don't even know

2571
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:12,639
what we're looking for yeah yeah I guess

2572
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:14,199
you could just have a simple metric that

2573
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:15,920
like if you really nailed the

2574
01:31:14,199 --> 01:31:19,320
registration then things would be more

2575
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:21,520
similar across people than if you didn't

2576
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:24,000
right unless they're not I mean I know

2577
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:26,000
Katrina MZ always used to tell us that

2578
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,440
the variation in

2579
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,560
architecture across areas is much less

2580
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:31,360
than the variation in architecture

2581
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:32,639
across people and I really hope that's

2582
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:35,480
not true like if that's true it's big

2583
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:36,760
trouble for us um but maybe it's true I

2584
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:39,080
don't know I mean there's just you know

2585
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:40,679
in neuro Neuro Imaging in general we

2586
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:43,040
always think of cross variability is the

2587
01:31:40,679 --> 01:31:44,239
single largest source of variance uh and

2588
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:47,159
that kind of drives the way we do

2589
01:31:44,239 --> 01:31:50,040
analysis because of variability um but

2590
01:31:47,159 --> 01:31:54,000
anyway the answer is some variants of

2591
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:55,280
no um so no we haven't done it but that

2592
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
data is going to be amazing if we can

2593
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:59,760
get it you know that will be super

2594
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,719
interesting I mean the other question is

2595
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:04,280
how we sample like you know we've had

2596
01:32:01,719 --> 01:32:06,280
tons of discussions on how we sample and

2597
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:08,239
that depends on what the underlying

2598
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:10,159
hypothesis is you know what are you

2599
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:11,159
trying to test and there different ones

2600
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:13,320
we would like to test we're not going to

2601
01:32:11,159 --> 01:32:15,119
be able to test them all what are some

2602
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:18,159
of the Imaging phenotypes that show the

2603
01:32:15,119 --> 01:32:20,119
most variation across people that's not

2604
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:21,639
just predicted by like age or something

2605
01:32:20,119 --> 01:32:23,280
like that oh cortical folds I guess

2606
01:32:21,639 --> 01:32:25,360
would be the first one folds are hugely

2607
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,840
variable for reasons we don't understand

2608
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,360
but even things like you know

2609
01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:30,080
ventricular volume like you look at a

2610
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:31,679
subject with large ventricles you know

2611
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:33,040
some people without ad have large

2612
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,960
ventricles some people with ad have

2613
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:37,199
small ventricles I mean it's one of the

2614
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:40,199
reasons why Radiologists use change as

2615
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:42,560
their measure of choice because then the

2616
01:32:40,199 --> 01:32:43,520
kind of Baseline values fall out right

2617
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,760
you don't care if the ventricle was

2618
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,719
bigger or small in in an absolute sense

2619
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:51,600
you just care that it's getting bigger

2620
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:52,400
or smaller um yeah but you know in fmri

2621
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,480
there are people that are good

2622
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,760
activators and people that aren't good

2623
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:58,400
activators what does that mean I don't

2624
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:59,880
know but repeatedly I mean Nancy camire

2625
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,639
earlier in her career was getting imaged

2626
01:32:59,880 --> 01:33:04,119
all the time because she was a great

2627
01:33:01,639 --> 01:33:05,560
subject um I don't know maybe she was

2628
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:06,560
just really dedicated and didn't move

2629
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:08,080
but maybe there's something about her

2630
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:11,320
vascular Anatomy that lends itself to

2631
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:14,159
being imaged well I don't

2632
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:15,360
know all right I think we're all set

2633
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:17,119
then thank you so much Bruce for a

2634
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:21,719
wonderful talk and thanks everyone for

2635
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:21,719
coming thank you it was fun
