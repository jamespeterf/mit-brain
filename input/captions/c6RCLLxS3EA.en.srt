00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,040
Good morning everybody. Welcome to the

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,679
MPG primer and today I have the pleasure

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,480
of introducing Masa Kai. He is a

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,240
research fellow in Dr. Remnik Xavier's

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,720
laboratory at MGH and at the Broad here.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,960
Um he previously completed his PhD in

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,519
biomedical informatics at Harvard

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,640
Medical School where he was co-vised by

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,800
doctors Mark Daly and Hillary Finine. As

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,199
a statistical geneticist, his research

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,280
focuses on identifying causal genetic

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,719
variants underlying complex diseases and

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,800
traits across diverse population. Add

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,480
additionally he leverages multiomics

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,480
approaches to functionally characterize

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,399
these causal variants and aims to

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,840
elucidate the molecular mechanisms

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,160
driving complex diseases. Um if you have

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,840
questions throughout, please come down.

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,680
The microphones are here on the side

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,840
again. Um and yeah, take it away Masa.

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,079
Thank you. All right. Thank you so much.

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,280
Um and thank you so much joining my uh

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,360
MPG primer this morning. Uh I'd like to

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,640
talk about uh fine mapping complex

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,880
traits in the bio

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,159
ranks. So for the first part of my talk

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,040
uh I would like to give a brief

29
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,960
introduction to f mapping. Before diving

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,159
into uh the details of the introduction,

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,200
uh I would like to um give a special

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,520
thanks to my colleague Ram uh who have

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,280
been working together with me for many

34
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,200
projects and she did great MPG primer

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,439
two years ago and geniusly shared a

36
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,920
couple of her background slides um for

37
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,920
my talk today.

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,600
So as many of you are familiar with uh

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,799
Jersus have been very very successful at

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:55,040
finding associations uh in the last 20

41
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:58,640
years. Uh this is the latest skier jus

42
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,640
from the PGC consortium. There are

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,719
around 300 LOSI that are general

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:08,800
significant. But if you really zoom into

45
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:11,760
each of these significant lossi

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,400
uh you may realize um pinpointing a

47
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,520
causal variant is really challenging.

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,080
This is primary because of their uh

49
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,879
because uh these genetic variants are

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,040
created each other

51
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,319
uh which is called linkage dise

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,000
equilibrium or aldi. Uh and this

53
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:35,680
correlation makes harder to identify

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,519
which one of these corated variants are

55
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,519
actually causally associated with a

56
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,519
disease.

57
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,760
So many of the f mapping methods uh aim

58
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,920
to nominate causal variants uh based on

59
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,400
the

60
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,319
scenario. Now you have a GS data which

61
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,000
is

62
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,040
observed and there should be a causal

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,560
snips which is

64
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,800
unobserved. What we observe is basically

65
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,159
the representation of these two causal

66
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:12,640
variants. Um and uh due to Audi and

67
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,200
noise uh we observe you know this kind

68
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,360
of locust

69
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:22,400
part and f mapping methods uh basically

70
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,920
uh disentangle these audi structure uh

71
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,560
into independent signals uh aiming to

72
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,560
identify each of these uh causal

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,560
variants.

74
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,000
So suppose this is a goal. Uh many f

75
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,080
methods uh outputs two

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
things. Uh first outputs is called

77
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,319
posterior inclusion probability or pip

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,400
uh which is a probability that a variant

79
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:57,360
is causal uh given the observed data.

80
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,159
uh second outputs is a kable sets which

81
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,959
mean to capture the uncertainty uh of

82
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,400
the identity of the coal variance due to

83
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:10,239
LD so you often uh see you know quable

84
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,040
set 95% corable set or 99% corable set

85
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:17,280
which basically means uh this you know

86
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,840
quible sets capture 95% of the PIP for

87
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,680
debinding dependent

88
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:25,360
signal and fapping methods basically

89
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,960
outputs these you know p um two outputs

90
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,759
and we heavily rely on um these outputs

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,479
to interpret which causal variance or

92
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,479
which signal uh is more likely to

93
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:45,199
cause. So based on uh these concepts uh

94
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,919
now I'd like to uh give a brief overview

95
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,199
of the f mapping methods.

96
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,880
uh I think there are two major axis uh

97
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,280
to categorize these fine mapping

98
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,919
methods. The first axis on the y-axis is

99
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,759
basically whether you model single coal

100
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,840
variant or multiple coal variants. Uh

101
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,160
and the second axis you can see on the

102
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:13,280
x-axis is basically um whether a method

103
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,840
is primary for a single cohort or

104
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,120
multiple cohorts. And for multiple

105
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,120
cohorts uh there's a distinction whether

106
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,080
uh your analysis is based on the meta

107
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,320
analysis or joint analysis or mega

108
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,120
analysis.

109
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,440
Um I don't dive into uh details into

110
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,440
each of the method uh but I would like

111
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,880
to cover uh some of the major methods

112
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,720
here uh and give you know a basic

113
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,520
concepts behind it. So the first uh and

114
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,039
the most straightforward one is this uh

115
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,639
method code or

116
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:55,199
ABF. ABF or approximate base factor uh

117
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,120
is basically a B method person you know

118
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,880
base factor for uh each variant. Um this

119
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,240
is pretty simple as you can see in the

120
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,319
equation here. Um this method basically

121
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,120
assumes a single causal variant in a

122
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,440
locus.

123
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,880
So

124
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,960
um in most cases uh these base factors

125
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,240
are roughly a monotonic transformation

126
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:24,080
of the Gcores that you observe in the

127
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:26,319
Gus and highest PIP uh are almost always

128
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,720
given to the uh most significant

129
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:36,039
variant. Uh this is you know very simple

130
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,039
uh method but still um

131
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,639
uh powerful or robust method that you

132
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,520
can rely on in many cases especially if

133
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,759
you don't have access to the LD matrix

134
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,280
or you know good external LD difference

135
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,039
panel ABS method is um the first method

136
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,039
you must try for your summary

137
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:59,680
statistics but of course because we

138
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,560
assume a single causal variant in a

139
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,280
locus. Uh this is a big uh limitation of

140
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,479
the AVF

141
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:14,080
method. So suppose uh in a um scenario

142
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,960
like you have uh three variants uh in

143
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,880
this particular great there's one uh two

144
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,919
variants called purple and letters are

145
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,960
causal variants. Uh gray variants in the

146
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,240
middle is just a non-causal typing

147
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:30,080
variants. But if these two causal

148
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,960
variants are weakly targeting the middle

149
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,840
non-cooaler variants and the two causal

150
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,520
variants are independent to each other

151
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:42,639
then ABF assigns the highest PIP to the

152
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,599
non-cooaler variant because the uh this

153
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,599
you know non-cooal variant is ted weekly

154
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,880
by two causal variants and having the

155
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,880
highest uh Gcore

156
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:01,479
similarly in a scenario where you have

157
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:04,720
two causal variants in the locus. Uh but

158
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:07,360
um neither of these two causal variants

159
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,599
are generally significant because uh

160
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,800
these two coar variants are correlated

161
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:17,360
to each other and have opposite uh two

162
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,680
causal effects or uh they have same

163
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,960
cause effects that

164
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,759
um correlation negative between the two

165
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,960
and in this case basically Audi cancels

166
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:34,120
out these coal effects. and ABF assigns

167
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,719
a low PIP to the non

168
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,360
associations and this might sounds like

169
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,200
a hypothetical alterations but we do

170
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,080
actually observe you know such examples

171
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,160
in the G data. So here this is in the

172
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:51,120
chromosome 5 in FGFR

173
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,240
for height uh we find mapped you know uh

174
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,839
in three bio banks BBJ and the UK bio

175
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:02,560
bank. If you focus on this uh ROS

176
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:06,240
244711 uh variant uh this variant is

177
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,640
actually fine mapped in every cohort but

178
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,880
not general wireless significant only in

179
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,120
the biomark Japan.

180
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,200
If you look closely uh into the

181
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,880
underlying causal structure, we

182
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:23,200
basically found out that there's another

183
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,800
uh miss uh miss variant of the FGFR4

184
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,200
uh which is also fine mapped in a

185
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:32,120
cohort and this miss variant has a

186
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,200
negative correlation to the uh this

187
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,680
RS244 the second causal variant only in

188
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,920
the bio bank Japan. So only in the bio

189
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,519
bank Japan the causal effects are

190
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,680
canceled out and the secondary uh causal

191
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,920
variant is not generally significant in

192
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,120
the

193
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:55,440
BBJ. So this clearly illustrates uh we

194
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:58,320
have to model multiple posants

195
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,440
uh for um for whatever you know five

196
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,839
mapping method you use uh for highly

197
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,839
powered

198
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:13,360
right so this is a natural

199
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,680
uh introduction to the um second cross

200
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,880
obser mapping method uh which I'd like

201
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,000
to cover today uh which is basically the

202
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,800
single cohote multicoser variance f

203
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,720
mapping method. There's a plenty of

204
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,720
multiple variance f mapping method for a

205
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:35,120
single cohote. Uh but if you

206
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,200
um ask us to characterize into you know

207
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,079
uh three

208
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:43,600
categories I think the first category is

209
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:47,720
uh basically conditional analysis. Uh

210
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:51,760
this method is sometimes called uh cojo

211
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,079
AVF. Uh basically cojo is a method that

212
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,160
you can do a conditional analysis on the

213
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,600
summary statistical level.

214
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:04,640
Um and ABF is a method that I described

215
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:09,279
earlier. So suppose uh you have uh you

216
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:13,279
observed um this uh kind of a rogus part

217
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:16,120
from your giver. You if you condition

218
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:20,320
the leader signal

219
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:22,399
uh using co then there then you might

220
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,839
observe the secondary signal independent

221
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:28,959
from the first variant. Co IBF simply

222
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:33,920
applies ABF method to the first summary

223
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:37,680
statistics. uh that conditioned on um

224
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,000
the second variant and a second summary

225
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,040
statistics that conditioned on the first

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,240
variant. So that by um by doing a

227
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:51,279
conditional analysis uh you can get

228
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:54,800
approximate um independent signals for

229
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:58,320
uh each of the method.

230
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:02,320
Um this is a kind of a powerful approach

231
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:06,000
but uh has a one uh big c big caveat. Uh

232
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:10,560
this method basically doesn't uh handle

233
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
the situation uh like the one left where

234
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,639
your uh non-causal variant is tucked

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,639
weakly by multiple causal variant. In

236
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,720
this case the lead variant is a

237
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,519
non-cooaler variant and if you condition

238
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,959
on the non-coosal variant uh then you

239
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,160
you basically lose uh independent signal

240
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,160
for both of the coal variants that are

241
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,160
retired.

242
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,639
Um so there's a more sophisticated

243
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,399
method uh which directly model causal

244
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,560
confilations

245
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:49,279
uh such as chabier kab f map

246
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:53,360
andg. So suppose uh you have um m

247
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:57,200
variance in the locus. Uh they're 2 to m

248
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:01,040
uh combinations of uh whether each of

249
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,120
the variants in the locus are kosa. Uh

250
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,839
you typically limit how many coal

251
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:11,519
variants uh or how many ones in this

252
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:13,440
gamma array um can uh exist together.

253
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,079
uh and you're going to compute uh this

254
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,600
probability uh based on some some

255
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:22,000
algorithm. Um most of their uh prior

256
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
methods

257
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,120
behun stocastic search which basically

258
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:37,240
enables bunk scale mapping. Um and the

259
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,240
pastries don't have to be

260
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,560
yep

261
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,079
in your

262
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,240
screen. Close this hiding some of the uh

263
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,320
Thank you.

264
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:57,440
Sure. It's fine. All right. Uh

265
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,720
uh where okay is a sub category uh of

266
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,399
the matcha variant uh fapping method is

267
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,000
some of the single effects model or

268
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,120
suji.

269
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,680
Uh basically in this model instead of

270
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,680
uh creating your you know single gammer

271
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,720
coal configuration

272
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:21,199
uh you divide uh your coal configuration

273
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,360
into L independent uh single effect coal

274
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,600
configurations.

275
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,199
uh and they basically uh developer uh

276
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,320
MPase iterative

277
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:36,320
uh they use their iterative basian step

278
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:39,760
wise selection uh or IB assess method to

279
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,839
comput distribution um of these single

280
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,480
effects and this substantially

281
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:50,120
um you know speed ups the computition

282
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,199
uh compared to the um previous

283
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,279
methods and basically these

284
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:58,880
computationally efficient methods such

285
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:03,440
as fine map and sushi uh booster uh

286
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:06,480
publishing a 2016 and 2020 uh has

287
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,760
finally enabled uh bio bank scale f

288
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,160
mapping like in the scales are 500,000

289
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,959
like a UK bio bank

290
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:19,199
and this opens a new mapping in my

291
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:22,880
opinion um just you know find map every

292
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,880
in uh in each bio

293
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:31,959
bank. So I'd like to switch my gear uh

294
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,920
and talk uh about the f mapping the

295
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,160
biomarks. There are a couple of

296
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,040
motivations why we want to find mapping

297
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,079
the biomanks instead of the a single you

298
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,959
know disease consortium or just a single

299
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,720
you know prospective cohort for one

300
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,920
trade.

301
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,560
First obvious reasons is now in the era

302
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,279
of the bio banks uh we have

303
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,759
substantially higher uh bigger number of

304
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,000
the you know samples and substantially

305
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,480
bigger number of the phenotypes that are

306
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,360
systematically corrected uh in each bio

307
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,839
bank. These are just examples but you

308
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,720
know you all familiar with the UK bio

309
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,440
bank uh finang or medium veteran program

310
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,399
bio bank Japan all of them have you know

311
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,399
more than uh uh hundreds of thousands of

312
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,079
the samples and hundreds of the

313
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,360
phenotypes that are systematically

314
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,759
corrected within each bark. Um and this

315
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,839
enable us a systematic comparison of the

316
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,120
fine mapping and the causal variance

317
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:33,199
across the diverse

318
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,120
operations. Actually uh in a global

319
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,199
effort called the global bio bank

320
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,720
metanas initi

321
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:43,759
uh we are able to uh collaborate with 23

322
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,399
barb banks around the globe totaling 2.2

323
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,160
million individuals. This is a data from

324
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:53,560
the 2022 and I believe now we have

325
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,320
around 30 bar banks uh more

326
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,639
than well I don't remember actual exact

327
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,120
numbers but you know uh these numbers

328
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,439
are growing uh and this made us are you

329
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:08,640
know this empires us uh to do a fire

330
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,640
mapping in at the

331
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:19,280
scale. Uh the second uh motivation is uh

332
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:22,880
we do expect more f mapping discovery by

333
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,480
starting more diverse cohorts. So in

334
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,720
human populations uh low frequency

335
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,520
varants are often tend to be a

336
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,880
population and ditched or

337
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,919
spasic and some of these variants are

338
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,960
even under section. So this is this one

339
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:42,039
where my favorite example uh alcohol

340
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:46,400
fresh and the AOD2

341
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:46,400
uh uh variant called

342
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:53,440
RS671. Um if you drink alcohol or

343
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:57,799
ethanol to be spacic um there are two

344
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:01,720
genes that are basically involved in uh

345
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:03,559
metaborization of uh alcohol.

346
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,400
Um

347
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:10,039
if you

348
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:14,080
have this RS671 variant basically that

349
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:16,799
inactivates AOD2 and these two are

350
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,480
basically a phenomenon called alcohol

351
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,360
fresh.

352
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,000
uh this particular variant is selected

353
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,400
in the east Asian populations

354
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,400
uh in the east regions uh

355
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,640
26% minor frequency in the rest of the

356
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,039
world less

357
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:40,120
than.1%. And moreover uh because

358
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,120
drinking behavior is heavily

359
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:49,120
um associated uh with your diet. uh this

360
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:53,360
RS671 associate with espherical cancer

361
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:57,200
and many other diseases um including you

362
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,760
know your uh good dietary pattern like

363
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,840
whether you want to whether you are more

364
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,400
likely to eat uh cheese or um drink a

365
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,600
milk or even a natto uh which is

366
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,600
fermented in soybeans

367
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,200
uh s motivation uh as we going to fact a

368
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,039
higher fapping resolution as you know uh

369
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,640
different ancestries have a different

370
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,080
audi length uh and

371
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,400
legions. So suppose you have two

372
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,320
populations that have a slightly

373
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,280
different uh audi length and

374
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,880
audiions by combining uh multiple

375
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:41,039
populations you're going to expect uh to

376
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,039
narrow down um basically audiion and

377
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:47,080
narrow down the causal variance. This

378
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,960
will highly uh uh improve the fing

379
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,880
resolution. So based on these

380
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,880
motivations uh

381
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:57,840
there uh multiple methods have been

382
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,640
proposed uh to conduct a multiple uh

383
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,880
cohort f mapping or multiple population

384
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,039
mapping. Um these uh methods are

385
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,120
basically divided into two groups

386
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,160
whether the meta analysis best or a

387
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:15,520
joint analysis based. So I'm going to

388
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:18,039
next explain uh what are the differences

389
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:22,280
of these two uh

390
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:25,440
approaches actually three

391
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:28,559
uh the first approach is the most

392
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,600
straightforward maybe uh it which is

393
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,919
very similar to the ga analysis

394
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:39,000
approach. Suppose you have a two

395
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:43,280
cohorts. Um you basically run GS in each

396
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,360
cohort metalises. You also uh computer

397
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:50,480
metanized audi matrix based on the uh LD

398
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,840
matrix from independent cohorts. Then

399
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:57,200
you quap this metanized gus and the

400
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,200
metaanized audi matrix. uh assuming you

401
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,919
know this summary statistics actually

402
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,400
came from a single cohort and they might

403
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:09,240
apply additional post QC

404
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,720
um to further uh remove a

405
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,440
spousal

406
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,679
signals. Uh second approach is uh kind

407
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,400
of similar to the meta analysis approach

408
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,120
but uh this is particularly we call a

409
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,360
post hawk meta approach. uh instead of

410
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,080
we are doing a meta analysis on the gus

411
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,039
we do a kind of a meta analysis on the

412
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,280
fine map to the f mapping

413
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:36,720
results so we basically done a fine

414
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,039
mapping in each individual cohort then

415
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,960
you're going to combine uh these f

416
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,600
mapping f mapping results either taking

417
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:50,000
you know uh minimum of the pip or

418
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,000
maximum of pip across the cohorts

419
00:21:52,640 --> 00:22:02,240
And the um third um approach is a joint

420
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:06,039
modeling approach. So um baser past two

421
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:11,039
previous two approaches

422
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:14,240
are analyzed uh after an um analyze you

423
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:17,640
know each cohort separately. But in this

424
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:21,120
approach uh you model two cohorts

425
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:24,159
jointly. Um presumably on a single

426
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,400
server uh you basically you know get a

427
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,000
gira

428
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,840
um summary statistics and the audi

429
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,320
matrix from each cohort and you run a uh

430
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,480
you run joint file mapping on these uh

431
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,200
summary statistics and the

432
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:44,400
matrices. Um all of these methods works

433
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,400
to some extent. uh but there are also

434
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,720
challenges uh underlying on these

435
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,679
methods. Uh in particular

436
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,760
uh if you have multiple cohorts you

437
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,480
should always expect there's some

438
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,840
heterogenity across the cohorts. It

439
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,520
could be phenotyping like you know um UK

440
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,400
bio bank is a population based uh bio

441
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,799
bank Japan is a hospital based. So for

442
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:15,840
disease phenotype we observe a higher

443
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:18,880
hatability in BBJ but for biomarkers you

444
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,440
observe a higher hat in the UK bio bank

445
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,480
because you know biomarkers in the BBJ

446
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,760
to some extent is influenced by the you

447
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,280
know these hospital-based

448
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,480
recruitment. Uh it could also be a

449
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,520
genotyping and amputation. Each cohort

450
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,320
uh by nature uses a different genotyping

451
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:42,320
array and a different imputation

452
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:45,200
uh methods and these differences in

453
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,320
phenotyping genotyping imputation uh

454
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,039
inevit inevitably creates a heterogenity

455
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,400
across cohorts that you know poses a

456
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,480
substantial challenge in f mapping. uh

457
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,280
there's also issue of the lack of the in

458
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,400
sample audi or adequate external audi

459
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:05,760
difference to conductor f mapping um but

460
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:10,200
which is a basically a separate issue um

461
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,200
and separate issue

462
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:19,440
um and again um the heterogenity issue

463
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,400
is a dr issue this is one example from

464
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,799
the covid-19 host genetic censorship

465
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,279
where we basically observe serve in a

466
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,679
well-known tick 2 locus

467
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,480
uh non missense variant is not general

468
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,240
wise significant just purely because uh

469
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,760
some of the cohorts are not well

470
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,720
imputing

471
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,799
uh well imputing this missence variant.

472
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,360
So just because of the missingness uh

473
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:46,240
not because of the real biology we miss

474
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,279
this you know missense variant uh from

475
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,679
the statistical mapping um and this

476
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,880
poses a significant challenge in the

477
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:59,279
underlying matter not the method itself

478
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,240
uh for you know for conducting a a

479
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,240
multico

480
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,960
mapping to evaluate uh to what extent

481
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,840
these heterogenity influence

482
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,799
uh fine mapping across the cohorts. We

483
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,840
did extensive

484
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:20,720
simulations. For example, uh we

485
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:23,760
simulated uh different geotyping array

486
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,880
um um under different scenario and

487
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,520
observe you know uh to what extent uh

488
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,440
that

489
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:34,799
um different genotyping arrays uh

490
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,320
contributes to the host discovery rate.

491
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,919
uh we simulated the different imputation

492
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,480
panels that actually substantially

493
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,159
contributes to the host discovery rate

494
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,840
because of the differential missingness

495
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,520
patterns. We genuated the genetic

496
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:53,799
ancestry which to some extent

497
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:58,159
contributes to their FDR. Uh but more

498
00:25:53,799 --> 00:26:00,480
importantly having African uh ancestry

499
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,039
uh contribute a lot to the improved

500
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,600
decal or improved power and this is

501
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,840
because African population tend to have

502
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,840
a shorter audi length compared to the

503
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,840
other

504
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,240
population. And finally a mixed scenario

505
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,919
where we observe in the worst case

506
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,440
scenario um there's a host discovery

507
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,760
rate observe up to the 30 to

508
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:29,000
40%. Um and this uh basically

509
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:32,640
demonstrates uh all the metalis mapping

510
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,279
is sign significantly miscalibrated in

511
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,480
the

512
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:40,600
generations. So to mitigate uh this

513
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:44,039
phenomenon uh we develop a method called

514
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:47,720
slurum. The idea is pretty

515
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:51,760
simple suppose you have

516
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:55,120
a g summary statistics like this. You

517
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:58,400
can say there's a one causal variant uh

518
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,279
that has five ting variants in a very

519
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,279
high linkage dis

520
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:09,679
equal. So we try to

521
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:13,880
um detect um locus that contains this

522
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:19,520
kind of a you know outrier variance

523
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:21,919
um and um identify uh low side that

524
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,400
contains you know such outri variants as

525
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,360
a suspicious low side for f mapping

526
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:31,520
based on um local

527
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:34,520
structure. Uh in the simulations we show

528
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,799
that um

529
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:40,960
um also not perfect

530
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:44,720
um host discovery rate uh in the

531
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,679
non-suspicious ROS side is 60% lower

532
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,240
compared to the suspicious ROS side and

533
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,279
in the real data using the GS catalog

534
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,520
here we use a nonmmerous uh coding

535
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,120
variant as a true coaler variants

536
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,120
because we don't know what is the true

537
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,200
causal variance we do see there

538
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,120
substantial enrichment

539
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,520
uh in the in the of the non synonymous

540
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,279
coding variance in a non-suspicious side

541
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:14,159
compared to the suspicious side.

542
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:17,080
Um both you know suggesting um several

543
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,320
methods make the issue of these you know

544
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,279
um um

545
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,960
heterogenity

546
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:27,600
mapping. So basically our studies shows

547
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,520
that you know naive uh single causal

548
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,120
variant or multiple causal variant

549
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:37,120
mapping methods are often miscalibrated

550
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,760
uh and post hawk tushi like a serum is

551
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,840
very important for a single causal

552
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,480
variant assumption

553
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:50,080
um we develop a method called serum and

554
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,720
there's a a recent paper uh that also

555
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,159
models a multiple cause varants if you

556
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,440
have are very good at matching out the

557
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:01,799
difference. Um, and this method is

558
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:05,080
called karma. Uh, and as you can

559
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:06,679
see here, uh, in the example

560
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:11,279
figure,

561
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:14,240
uh, where, um, basically, you know, you

562
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:18,360
have a two causal variants. Well, where

563
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:22,880
where you have um varants

564
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:27,480
uh many variants in the high

565
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:31,840
uh in the customer um they correctly

566
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:36,080
assign you know u low but uh nearly

567
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:39,039
equal pip to their multiple variants

568
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:42,000
whereas if you naively use a sushi with

569
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,960
the external reference panel then you're

570
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,799
going to get you know many like more

571
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:53,679
than uh or nearly equal to 10

572
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:57,919
um coal variance with BIP equal one. So

573
00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:00,159
um this karma method works um well uh in

574
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,919
a situation when you have a good audio

575
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,039
difference panel like you know if you

576
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,159
are doing a uh the homogeneous uh

577
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:12,520
European meta analysis and this might

578
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,520
you know be additional

579
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:19,279
um support

580
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:22,159
um in addition to you know um uh our

581
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,159
proposal

582
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:35,360
message. Um you can also do a post hawk

583
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:39,039
meta approach. Um this is purely bas

584
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:42,159
assumption that uh if your single cohort

585
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,960
fing method is well calibrated

586
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:48,240
uh post hawk matter is often calibrated

587
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:52,399
but less powerful. So suppose you know

588
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,039
you have a UK bio bank Japan uh in each

589
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,360
bio bank you did a decent job of find

590
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,679
mapping you know these geo summary

591
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,320
statistics with sushi

592
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,559
uh instead of you know trying to do a

593
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,960
meta analysis or trying to do a joint

594
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:10,559
modeling across the cohorts that gives

595
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,120
you you know extra computational cost.

596
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:17,200
You can simply take a f mapping method

597
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:22,159
from each coord uh and combine results

598
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:26,559
by either taking the maximum for

599
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:29,440
um for most discovery or either taking a

600
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,159
minimum of a pip or you know very

601
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,640
consumptive

602
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:38,480
method. Um and in this way you can uh

603
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,200
hope you can basically preserve the

604
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:46,080
world calibration but less power or less

605
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,559
recall um without uh doing additional u

606
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,440
joint uh fine mapping or joint met

607
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,440
analysis across the

608
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:58,399
cohorts. All right.

609
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:09,120
Um then uh I would like to uh talk about

610
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:12,799
the uh final um category of the fine

611
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,440
mapping which is a joint analysis. Um I

612
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,600
don't particularly see a single causal

613
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,960
variant multiple cohort joint analysis

614
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:24,080
method. Uh I'm pretty sure there is but

615
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,039
I don't think um you know there's

616
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,640
nothing

617
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:33,840
um widely um or nothing outstanding um

618
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,640
but uh in the multiple causal variant

619
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:41,320
multiple cohort sing uh there's a pranky

620
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,320
m development uh going on

621
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:51,519
uh one of the first uh moser variant mut

622
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:55,679
A fat method is called painter which is

623
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:58,240
which was published in uh 2014 so 10

624
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,600
years ago more than 10 years ago. Uh

625
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,399
this methods is pretty you know um

626
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,120
innovative at the moment. Uh but

627
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:10,320
unfortunately not very computationally

628
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:14,159
scalable like you cannot you know model

629
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:16,559
multiple cause of varants um like more

630
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:20,159
than two or three based on the

631
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,840
complexity uh of uh depending on the

632
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,640
complexity uh in your

633
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,519
orus. Uh thanks to the develop

634
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,559
development of the suji

635
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:36,120
um there is a waves of the suji

636
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:40,880
extensions to our multiple

637
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:44,399
cohorts. Uh namely there are uh three

638
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:47,679
methods uh proposed so far. Uh first

639
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:51,720
things are Emmy Sushi Gwal Nature

640
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:55,360
Gentics uh Suji Ax uh by

641
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:58,760
Yang also Nature Gentics uh and there

642
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,519
finally Miuji

643
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,320
Mos which is currently in on the meta

644
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:08,679
archive.

645
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:12,280
uh these methods uh by

646
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:15,839
D shares the you know

647
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:18,399
same intention or same desire you want

648
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,879
to extend your sushi method into a

649
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,280
multiple operations but there's a you

650
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,320
know methodological differences uh among

651
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,679
the you know three methods

652
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:34,000
uh first of all uh among the three

653
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,399
methods uh only the me sushi

654
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,560
uh

655
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:43,599
can well only the MUI models

656
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,320
unsuspic variants. Sushi X and M sushi

657
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:49,119
for the sake of the computational

658
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:51,200
efficiency assumes their uh causal

659
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,919
variance are shared across the

660
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,599
populations if they exist I mean if they

661
00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:00,200
are frequent um in a in a given

662
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:04,720
population

663
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:08,640
um based on the um literature'ses uh I

664
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:12,240
think this uh shared cause assumption is

665
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:16,079
very valu So you know uh flexibility in

666
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:20,440
the model um use your liberty for me

667
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:23,920
sushi uh to model as this particles

668
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:28,240
effect then uh for your effect size

669
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,640
modeling uh multi suji and mu sushi uh

670
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,560
models effect sizes are created across

671
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,880
ancestries uh to some parameter row um

672
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:41,359
and this is you know b's observations

673
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:47,079
are cross population uh gen correlation

674
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:51,920
Uh and finally uh on the uh post hawk uh

675
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:56,079
processing level uh there is the sushi

676
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:59,160
has a filter called py filter which

677
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,680
basically removes uh

678
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:05,640
quos that contains

679
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:10,160
um varants

680
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:12,720
uh with uh our scare they're um less

681
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,760
than a certain threshold. So that if the

682
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,160
qual set for a single effect if the

683
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,680
variants are not related to each other

684
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,160
in for for a given credible s then that

685
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,560
credible sat is deemed to be a non-pure

686
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,160
and removed from theis removed from the

687
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,200
out

688
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,480
uh multisji paper uh basically finds

689
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:38,839
that if you have this future uh maybe

690
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:43,800
your credible sets are pure uh

691
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:47,480
but um um uh decode is substantially

692
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:51,200
decreased. Uh and SUJIX basically uh

693
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:53,839
implemented uh disputed filter uh so

694
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,560
that in in their in the M suji papers

695
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:59,359
comparison they actually compared uh

696
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,000
suji x with future and the suji x

697
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,599
without you know future future. But

698
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,560
these are you know basically main

699
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:11,079
differences in terms of the um

700
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:14,320
theoretical um um

701
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:19,200
modeling and in terms of the performance

702
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,680
uh these are u performance comparison uh

703
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,240
based on the

704
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:27,839
shimmerations on the panel a uh we

705
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,400
basically compare uh calibration

706
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,920
uh so what you can see here is you know

707
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,680
for pap

708
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,640
9 a threshold basically three all the

709
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,920
methods all the sushi extension methods

710
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:45,280
have are very well calibrated

711
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,200
uh followed by pip me pip meta methods

712
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,760
which is basically taking the maximum

713
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,000
pip across the cohorts

714
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,280
um

715
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,200
and u um

716
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:01,440
naive meta analysis methods like HB

717
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,160
matter SCB matter is not calibrated

718
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,000
compared to the other methods. Uh in

719
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:11,839
terms of the recoil uh again uh three

720
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,240
methods have a very uh comparable recoil

721
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:21,079
uh mi suji uh is a top followed by suji

722
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:24,640
x and m sushi then pip matter

723
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:28,480
um and you know again naive methods

724
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,480
won't work well uh precision n car

725
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,040
basically gives you a same conclusion

726
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,280
and pan is important practically because

727
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,680
you you know if you run into a if you

728
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,800
run f mapping methods your computational

729
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:45,280
cost is a huge constraint.

730
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:52,040
Um and basically multisuji authors uh

731
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:57,040
shows that uh me sushi is a prohibitary

732
00:38:52,040 --> 00:39:00,680
um slow uh and memory intensive compared

733
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:05,520
to the sushi x and the m

734
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:08,079
sushi. So based on these results um you

735
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,599
know

736
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,680
uh we can conclude that you know um

737
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,800
these sushi extensions to the multiple

738
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:21,040
cohort methods have a higher potential

739
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:23,920
um and higher potential for mapping uh a

740
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,960
cohort jointly

741
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,599
uh at a biod scale. But this comes uh

742
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,160
this always comes with a caution uh

743
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:37,200
which um I have to stress

744
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,280
uh these methods uh still suffer from

745
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,720
the

746
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,359
interceding especially missing us due to

747
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,359
the amputation

748
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,480
cori paper uh mitigates this issue by

749
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,520
using all of us the whole genome

750
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,200
sequencing data. So all the cohorts they

751
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,000
find mapped in their paper uh is a whole

752
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,040
general sequence uh and from a single

753
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,160
bio bank

754
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:09,040
um meaning you know we expect lesser

755
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,000
heterogenity across their populations.

756
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:16,800
But if you want to find map say UK bio

757
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,400
bank and uh MVP then you know these two

758
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,200
bio banks have completely different

759
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,280
phenotyping scheme generyping and

760
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:28,079
limitation technologies and you should

761
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:31,200
um really um put extra caution uh when

762
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,000
analyzing and interpreting these data uh

763
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,240
using their you know joint uh using the

764
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,320
these joint file mapping methods. May I

765
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,640
ask a question Masa? Sure. um in the

766
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,280
last 3 minutes or so before the Q the

767
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,440
official Q&A um is there a way that you

768
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,760
can sort of flag these regions where you

769
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,760
have this heterogeneity and missingness

770
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,880
so that you at least know not to look

771
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:56,200
under those rocks as much. Sure. So

772
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,680
that's basically the methods uh here

773
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,920
throw which frogs these outraear

774
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,680
variants in a single coer variant or

775
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,680
customer if you assume multiple coer

776
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,240
variants but these are the methods that

777
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,160
mean to you know frog these side and

778
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,920
then remove them and that can work with

779
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,920
the multiple um cohorts together.

780
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,920
Thanks.

781
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,200
All right.

782
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:26,200
[Music]

783
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Um so

784
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,680
uh instead of summary uh I would like to

785
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,200
show this uh tentative best practice

786
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:40,359
flowchart uh which is beautifully

787
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,359
designed by uh LAN um

788
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:50,000
um suppose uh you have a low data

789
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:52,400
um and you want to basify map your GS

790
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,119
summary statistics. Uh if you follow

791
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:59,680
this scen uh for church uh you need to

792
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,640
what we believe as a best practice so

793
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,720
far for

794
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:08,160
mapping for first part. If you have our

795
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:12,319
individual remote data then you you know

796
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:14,800
first have to do uh Q and the GS uh in

797
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:17,680
the standard procedure very carefully.

798
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,000
But if your underlying um individual

799
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:24,079
data contains multiple

800
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,319
ancestries then uh we going to recommend

801
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:32,000
uh using uh m suji or sushi x for joint

802
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:34,000
f mapping or a pip matter uh for you

803
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,760
know single cohort f mapping then taking

804
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:42,040
a max pip across across operations.

805
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:45,599
If your uh cohort is

806
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:48,839
um negatively heterogeneous but still

807
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:52,000
within a similar ancestry ve

808
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:54,560
uh I didn't cover this topic uh in

809
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,079
today's talk but there is a method to

810
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,280
compute a coordinate adjusted matrix uh

811
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,040
which is important if you are cahot is

812
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,599
heterogeneous and then you can run a

813
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,760
standard f mapping exclusion f map and

814
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:12,560
if you are homogeneous computing

815
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:15,359
samp that's you know our recommendation

816
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:18,839
if you have our individual level data if

817
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:22,480
you have a summary level data knowing

818
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:25,760
sampleing then the meta analysis uh be

819
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,599
sorry f mapping becomes more uh

820
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,520
challenging and you need extra

821
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:36,079
caution your summary statistics is still

822
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,200
formal one code uh or if your meta

823
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,599
analysis

824
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:44,160
uh in your meta analysis all studies are

825
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,640
from the same underlying cohort like

826
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,920
auto bus or you know whatever as a

827
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,640
single uh technology or single cohort

828
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,040
then you can probably carefully choose

829
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,640
the external row difference that

830
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:01,839
represent your summary statistics

831
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,240
um then you can for multiple cause of

832
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,880
variant file mapping or if you don't

833
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,760
find a good reference You can either run

834
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,640
a serum or AVF

835
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:15,520
simply if you have a meta analysis uh

836
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,880
from a different ancestries. Uh only

837
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:22,319
thing you can do is aum um because karma

838
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,880
is not um currently handle that

839
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:27,280
particular

840
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,599
situation. So hopefully uh this uh best

841
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,680
practice flowchart will guide you to

842
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,079
some extent how you going to do a fine

843
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,560
mapping in your future studies.

844
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,119
Uh and with that uh I'd like to

845
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:43,040
acknowledge

846
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:47,119
um uh my uh PhD mentors Mark and Harry

847
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:49,359
uh Jacob Hun uh for their great support

848
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,480
during you know our f mapping work and
