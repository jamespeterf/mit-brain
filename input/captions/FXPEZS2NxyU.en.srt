1
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,199
good afternoon

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,080
everybody hi um I'm Sangita welcome to

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,240
the session nanom medicine for all um we

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,960
have a great uh session planned for you

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,640
today I'm going to start by just giving

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,439
a little bit of overview about what we

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,000
mean by nanom medicine for those of you

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,640
who aren't used to thinking about nanot

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,960
technology and medical terms um and then

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,879
we're going to have three fantastic

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,360
speakers um and we're going to close out

12
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,440
with a

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,399
panel

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,760
um okay so uh for this crowd I think

15
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,920
it's you're you're well familiar with

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,879
the idea of nanotechnology emerging from

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,399
a combination of top down fabrication

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,840
and bottom up synthesis um and

19
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,120
collectively now we have nanoscale

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,680
materials that have these fascinating

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,199
properties that emerge Optical

22
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,239
properties electronic properties

23
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,520
magnetic properties and this is all of

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,799
your world um what's been really

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,400
exciting for those of us like me who are

26
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,000
trained as a physician as well as an

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,240
engineer is that when you make materials

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,520
this small you can open up new areas

29
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,840
areas of biology and medicine these

30
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:25,479
materials are now right sized to talk to

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,960
biology and there are emerging nanoscale

32
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:30,040
biomedical properties as well as these

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,560
sort of physical properties so so what

34
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,240
does that look like first of all on the

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,640
left here you see that there are a

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,439
number of materials that have emerged

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,640
that have made it all the way into

38
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,640
clinical trials so these are materials

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,920
that were synthesized on the bench

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,640
characterized looked up for their safety

41
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,119
they had these emergent properties and

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,079
they're they're now in humans many of

43
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,640
you actually got one of these nanop

44
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,000
particles in the MRNA vaccine those are

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,759
lipid nanoparticles so those are

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,920
materials that have been in millions of

47
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,960
people um and what's so amazing about

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,119
them if you look at this sort of

49
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,960
molecular ruler is that the Nano scale

50
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,599
is actually the length scale at which

51
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,760
biology happens DNA is nanometer scale a

52
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:14,680
virus is 100 nanometers a cell is about

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,080
10 microns a single receptor is

54
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,239
something that you can interrogate with

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,720
one of these nanomaterials and as a

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,560
community studying nanom medicine which

57
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,120
is nanotechnology applied to medicine

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,040
for about 20 years researchers around

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,040
the world have been discovering new

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,640
properties and on the right here you see

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,360
some of the properties that we've

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,200
discovered about biological nanoscale

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,800
systems for example materials of

64
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,120
different size at the nanoscale when

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,720
injected in the human body will traffic

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,000
to different organs 100 nanometer

67
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,920
particle will go to the liver a 3

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,560
nanometer particle will go to the

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,159
bladder the shape of a material can

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,760
affect whether a cell internalizes it or

71
00:02:55,159 --> 00:03:00,640
not if it's long and floppy or if it's

72
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,920
small and hard

73
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,239
you can make materials that actually are

74
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,400
activated by the human body by enzymes

75
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,400
or low PH or oxidative state so they're

76
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,799
bioresponsive and when you put materials

77
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,760
in the body they actually get coated

78
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:18,879
with proteins and biomolecules and that

79
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,640
those codings those interactions can

80
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,280
then direct where the nanomaterials go

81
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,159
so the combination of Nano

82
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,840
nanotechnology and medicine is giving

83
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:30,080
rise this whole set of new insights and

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,360
new capabilities that we are collective

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,000
really excited about and I hope you can

86
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,080
learn a little bit more about

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,640
today I just want to give you sort of

88
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,959
one last snippet which is that this is

89
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,280
an incredibly exciting time for those of

90
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,920
us in nanom medicine and that's because

91
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,439
there's a convergence of Decades of

92
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,959
science coming from two pretty disperate

93
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,760
Fields so on the top here you see the

94
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,560
convergence really of fabrication

95
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,519
Technologies and the speed at which

96
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,760
those have accelerated of course this

97
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:59,400
has really been driven by our

98
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,480
interesting computation collectively and

99
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,959
many of you work in this space but what

100
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,760
you may or may not know is there are

101
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,280
areas in biology and medicine and

102
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,439
chemistry that have been quietly

103
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,239
accelerating on their own and here I

104
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,760
give just one example which is the

105
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:18,759
example of RNA RNA being Advanced as a

106
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,440
therapeutic RNA interference mRNA

107
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,360
packaging of RNA into nanomaterials and

108
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,639
those two things really came together

109
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,040
over Co to scale up materials and as I

110
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,039
said to show that they were safe in

111
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,039
millions of people now the these same

112
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:34,680
materials are are being used to enable

113
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,600
crisper or genome editing so if you look

114
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,919
at the convergence of these time scales

115
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,880
in this moment of time um it's

116
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,120
incredibly powerful to think about how

117
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,000
we get to leverage all of this

118
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,080
engineering and all of this biomedical

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,479
work um and and think about ways to

120
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,280
combine

121
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:52,840
them um I run a center here at MIT uh

122
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,880
the marble Center for Cancer nanom

123
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,320
Medicine Kurt is actually here today and

124
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,880
we have a fantastic group of

125
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,759
investigators we're localized in the

126
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,759
Koch Institute we have collectively over

127
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,000
200 community members thinking about

128
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,800
some of these problems so please come

129
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
visit us we were super productive we

130
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,960
publish a lot about this we patent a lot

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,840
we've had a lot of startups um which

132
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,400
some of you may be um exposed to and

133
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,639
some of the ideas that we are really

134
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,520
excited about right now are listed here

135
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,720
the idea that you can intercept cancer

136
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,319
before it's lethal the idea that you

137
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,360
might be able to vaccinate in a

138
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,680
personalized way against cancer the idea

139
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,440
that you can precise ly treat cancer U

140
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,840
by knowing more about its genetic code

141
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,759
and finally really the theme of today is

142
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,319
how we can take all of these discoveries

143
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,160
and make them accessible to patients all

144
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:44,800
around the world um which is actually

145
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,199
not the case today as you know the lipid

146
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,039
nanop particles that I described to

147
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,120
require a cold chain they require being

148
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,960
frozen at minus 80 degre so we really

149
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,400
want to think about how we can enable

150
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,400
these medicines um spreading all around

151
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,639
the world so as I said come visit um

152
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,639
today we have some community members

153
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,639
here that you're going to hear from

154
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,520
we're going to start off with Muji gendi

155
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,240
and then Angie beler and then Bob Langer

156
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,080
and um then we're going to have a panel

157
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,599
um and take questions from all of

158
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,000
you so with that I'm going to briefly

159
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:16,599
introduce M Muji um he is the Lester

160
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,639
wolf professor of chemistry he trained

161
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,840
at Harvard the University of Chicago and

162
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,400
Bell Labs before arriving at MIT in 1990

163
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,560
to join the Department of Chemistry his

164
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,599
work on the basic concepts in Material

165
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,319
Science synthesis of high quality

166
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:33,880
nanoparticles and dots led to the 2023

167
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:35,160
Nobel Prize in chemistry his lab's

168
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,000
research ranges from the very

169
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,120
fundamental applications in

170
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,360
electrooptics uh to applications in

171
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,039
biology and he's going to tell us in

172
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,100
just 10 short minutes about what he's

173
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:52,160
thinking about now so welcome

174
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:55,039
[Applause]

175
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,280
mui well thank you Sangita and I'm

176
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,879
really delighted to be here um I'm going

177
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,400
to tell you about this this journey

178
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,479
start uh in the mid

179
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,000
1990s when uh the field discovered that

180
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,680
we could make really bright uh Quantum

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,680
dots of multiple colors with an

182
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,319
absorption where um uh that was uh

183
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,599
continuous into the visible and

184
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:22,039
especially at 465 nanometers which is

185
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,280
where the blue Gallum nitride diod that

186
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,199
were had just been invented and so that

187
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,720
meant that we can think about

188
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,160
multiplexing using one of these new new

189
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,560
fangled blue diodes and if we could

190
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,599
Target different parts of cells or do

191
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,960
indal

192
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,520
biology uh uh then we could image with

193
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,199
one light source but if only we could

194
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,159
get the quantum dots to be compatible

195
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:50,440
with Biology um and um so we were able

196
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:53,240
to do that uh in the late 1990s and then

197
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,360
I that's when I first met uh Bob Langer

198
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,520
because I went to his office and we were

199
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,199
um about to start Quantum dock operation

200
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,680
I had no idea what I was doing and so I

201
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:06,280
went to Bob and asked him for advice on

202
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,360
what to do with starting this company so

203
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,280
I started this company with Paul vados

204
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:15,120
and shiman vice at Berkeley and a couple

205
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,639
business and and so this

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,000
company's created the first product of

207
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,360
quantum dots coded so that they would be

208
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,800
able to target cells uh this was an

209
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,960
example from a a paper from that period

210
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,960
of time looking at a cell uh comparing

211
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,599
Alexa 488 which is a d labeling this the

212
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,279
skeleton of the cell and then the

213
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,560
nucleus being labeled with a quantum dot

214
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:42,760
showing the difference in in the uh

215
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,760
photo bleaching um so um that that is

216
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,959
actually a hard application of quantum

217
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,680
dots but we pursued it the easy

218
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,360
application is all over the place today

219
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,480
if you have any Samsung screens

220
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,240
somewhere here uh they're full of

221
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,360
quantum dots to to get the beautiful

222
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,120
green and and red colors at low

223
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,000
efficiency so when you you know as a

224
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,279
side note if you create something that's

225
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,920
more energy

226
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:09,440
efficient humans find a way to spend as

227
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,120
much energy so we just make it bigger

228
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,839
and brighter and it uses much energy so

229
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,279
you have these beautiful big bright

230
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,360
screens thanks to the quantum dots um so

231
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:22,120
but anyway so we had to learn how to

232
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,680
handle

233
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,720
nanomaterials um in the biological

234
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,640
environment we had to learn how to make

235
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,320
them non-sticky so that we could inject

236
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,720
in this mouse model here the reds are

237
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,480
the quantum dots the green is gfp so

238
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,120
that they would be able to get out of

239
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,959
the of the vasculature into the tissue

240
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,480
so we could access things that we wanted

241
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,360
to Target so we had to learn how to coat

242
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,760
these things you with PEG or or zionic

243
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,320
molecules we realized that size was

244
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,560
incredibly important we did some

245
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,360
biodistributions and realized that if

246
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,240
you wanted to have something that could

247
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,200
go in there Target and clear it had to

248
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,680
be probably less than about 6 nmet in

249
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,320
hydrodynamic diameter otherwise go to

250
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,839
the liver or just stick around for a

251
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,720
long time and you'd get this background

252
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,040
and so we worked very hard to make them

253
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,040
as small as possible and also we worked

254
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,720
hard to understand the effect of shape

255
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,720
this was work done with Rakesh Jane at

256
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,000
at MGH so we looked at different sizes

257
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,360
uh this is an a tumor micro environment

258
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,440
going from 12 nanometers to 125

259
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,920
nanometers in size and you look at the

260
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,360
penetration depth as the distance from

261
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,440
The Vessel up here you see that you know

262
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,040
the big ones 60 nomers they just just

263
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,480
don't go into the tissue at all they

264
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,920
just stay in the blood vessels so in

265
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,800
terms of delivery that's terrible the 12

266
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,240
NM one is able to penetrate out of the

267
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,519
blood vessels into the into the into the

268
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,000
tumor um then if you look at uh at the

269
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:49,600
effective shape U also uh so these are

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,200
two particles of different shapes mology

271
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,720
is the same volume same volume but if

272
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,200
you look at the the rod one like you

273
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,639
know it's pretty long but it's pretty

274
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,839
narrow you find again that the tumor

275
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,320
transport for the rod the red bar here

276
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,880
is much better than the sphere even

277
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,639
though they have the same volume so it's

278
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,160
a small it's a small Dimension that

279
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,920
really matters in terms of being able to

280
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,240
go through the vasculature into the

281
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,519
tissue and being able to

282
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:20,000
diffuse so um we learn how to Target

283
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,040
things in Vivo in ways so the these are

284
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,880
rare hematopoetic precursor cells that

285
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,519
um you know generally before in the old

286
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,920
days you'd have to take them out label

287
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,800
them and put them back in if you wanted

288
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,360
to in Vio but here we were able to show

289
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,040
that with a multicolor Imaging we could

290
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,880
take Quantum dots of two different

291
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:42,000
colors uh and and um which then go to

292
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,440
receptors that are overexpressed on the

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,279
on on these particular cells jointly

294
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,399
they're not um they don't uh label blue

295
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:52,880
hers blue so what you're really looking

296
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,600
for is yellow then in your microscope

297
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,360
and then you can find these very rare

298
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:01,639
cells in the uh in in in the this is in

299
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,839
the um in the bone marrow of this mouse

300
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,760
model and then and then you can look at

301
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,600
different ones of these and see where

302
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,000
where they uh where they reside and you

303
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,160
know eventually one would like to

304
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,480
understand about the micro environment

305
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,440
of these particular cells and so doing

306
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,680
this in Vivo is super important because

307
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,279
then you're not affecting them you're

308
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,959
not differentiating them you're looking

309
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,639
at them in their environment without

310
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:29,240
without uh disturbing them this is kind

311
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,959
of a hero experiment um uh and and so we

312
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,839
thought you know what are what are um

313
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,600
dos good for that D molecules aren't

314
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,000
good for one of the things it could be

315
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,480
good for is to go into the infrared

316
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,480
where tissue is less scattering and so

317
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,720
we worked again with with

318
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,920
Rakesh we created these composite

319
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,040
particles that are about 100 nanometers

320
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,720
why do we do that is because you can

321
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,040
actually see the individual particles so

322
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,560
if you want to track the individual 100

323
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,839
nanom particles that are floresent you

324
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:59,920
can actually see them in real time um so

325
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,880
we use regular dots the the four five

326
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,360
nanometer dots to label the the um the

327
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,079
arteries and the veins and the uh the

328
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,480
the the the tumor itself this is

329
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:13,959
actually uh separated in time because

330
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,880
the arteries come first then you wait

331
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,279
and the veins come out you know as the

332
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,720
particles clear then you wait more and

333
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,360
then everything clears except what's in

334
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,720
the tumor because it gets stuck in the

335
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,800
tumor and so you can label then the

336
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,399
different time snapshots different

337
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,880
colors to label different things then we

338
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,000
can go in with the composite particles

339
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,800
now we know where to look and we can

340
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
look at the disease tissue versus the

341
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,880
normal tissue and then we can see the

342
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
difference in flow and you see in the

343
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,800
normal tissue you know very fast flow

344
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,399
these are the little white dots are the

345
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,920
individual 100 nanometer particles uh

346
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,199
using uh you know uh basically Night

347
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:54,199
Vision Imaging and uh in the disease

348
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:57,519
tissue you see the flow is really not

349
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:59,880
great right so this is a real this is a

350
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,199
visual way of seeing why it's hard to

351
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,959
treat cancer you can't deliver it you

352
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:08,040
can't deliver Therapeutics Rakesh was

353
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:12,000
interested in figuring out how

354
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:15,480
to first uh use a therapeutic to change

355
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,600
the flow from something that was really

356
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,279
pendular you know not going anywhere by

357
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,279
snipping out the small the growth of

358
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,120
small small blood vessels for instance

359
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,320
to make it more like the normal flow so

360
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,360
you can actually deliver things you can

361
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,600
make it less acidic you know get oxygen

362
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,720
in there and all these things and so I I

363
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,240
really enjoyed this but then you know I

364
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,199
I was always interested in going into

365
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,399
humans and so we had learned a lot uh

366
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,399
from doing all this over the years we

367
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:45,880
applied this to uh FDA

368
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:49,199
approvable stuff this is the story of

369
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:53,320
lumel which was funded by the marble

370
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:56,800
family seed funded initially back in the

371
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:00,480
um early 2000s or late 2000s

372
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,279
actually and um and and so uh we created

373
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:07,399
this nanometer size object with die

374
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:08,839
quencher pair so that in attached with

375
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,480
the peptide so then the presence of a

376
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,240
solid tumor this peptide gets cleaved by

377
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,160
enzymes that are overexpressed in the

378
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,399
tumor releasing a d molecule which is um

379
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:22,360
which is uh fluorescent and what we

380
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,160
learned from the quantum dot work was

381
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:27,519
all about clearance and biodistribution

382
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,880
because given the specification of the

383
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,639
surgery we knew that we had to have the

384
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,319
injection early morning the surgery had

385
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,440
to be a few hours later you couldn't

386
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:38,880
have the injection the night before

387
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,680
because patients often just come in for

388
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,160
for you know outpatient surgery and so

389
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,880
it had to it had to become active within

390
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,600
a couple hours then it had to clear by

391
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,440
the end of the day you know within six

392
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,319
seven hours and so that defined the size

393
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,480
of the molecule right and had to clear

394
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:59,240
through the kidneys and so by defining

395
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,880
the size and defining all the little p

396
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,000
where were able to create this agent we

397
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,600
um combined it with a handheld Imaging

398
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,639
system that came out of our work on

399
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,040
being able to see single Quantum dots we

400
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,319
knew how to do things very sensitively

401
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,240
and uh I'm happy to say that after a

402
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:17,639
long period you know this company

403
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,560
finally got FD approval for fluorescence

404
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,959
assistance surgery back in April so now

405
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,160
they're busy scaling it up and hopefully

406
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:28,000
going to a commercial product for

407
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,519
helping breast cancer patients uh uh

408
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,360
very soon

409
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,880
basically uh first quarter of

410
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,880
2025 um another thing that I was

411
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,120
interested in was also this issue of

412
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,120
gatal linium which I think doesn't get

413
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:46,199
enough play what gatal linium is not is

414
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,279
used in uh in in MRI imaging I mean it

415
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:51,839
works really really well you know the

416
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:53,880
Radiologists love it it's just amazing

417
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,959
but it's got some problem G Lim is not a

418
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:59,120
normal element that you use in the body

419
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,160
and so it's been shown to accumulate in

420
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,120
the brain if you have multiple sessions

421
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:07,280
of this agent it's an environmental

422
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,880
problem like the Boston Harbor Tokyo Bay

423
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,600
San Francisco Harbor they're full of

424
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,480
gatal lium from the hospitals that are

425
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,480
around it and the patients get injected

426
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,280
they pee it out and uh turns out of iron

427
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,000
oxide if you make iron oxide really

428
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,400
really tiny and we made this really tiny

429
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,079
ligan that's zonic so that we could keep

430
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,720
the size to sub five nanometers in the

431
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,240
hydrodynamic diameter you can create an

432
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,960
iron oxide that looks like galenium it

433
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,400
reacts the same way it's a positive

434
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,240
contrast so you can see the injection

435
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,000
you can see the the arteries and then

436
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,080
the the bladder showing up in this case

437
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,840
these are slightly bigger agents about

438
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:46,679
23 minutes later the bladder is is is

439
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,200
full um you can see this beautiful

440
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:50,919
Imaging in this mouse and then if you

441
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,440
make it then you can look at the

442
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,000
biodistribution and see that you know

443
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,320
most of it comes out in the urine there

444
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,120
a little bit in the the liver um and if

445
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,799
you make it even smaller you you can

446
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,000
then try to think about actually

447
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,000
targeting with these small iron oxide

448
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,320
particles so now this is even faster so

449
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,120
by 10 minutes it's already gone into the

450
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,760
into the bladder this is mimicking the

451
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,960
biodistribution of

452
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,880
galum very well this is after five

453
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,320
minutes it's already going into the into

454
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,480
the kidneys and then um depending on the

455
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,559
size you can decide either to do imaging

456
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,039
of the of the blood flow or you can do

457
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:26,720
decide to Target into tissue uh we

458
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:29,280
applied this first with Peter Caravan

459
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,000
and Ellen jasenof at MIT

460
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,080
to look at um uh

461
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,520
at uh liver fibrosis and so this is an

462
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,640
image of on the right hand side here my

463
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,080
right hand side is a standard sha Mouse

464
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,559
and then the left hand side here is a

465
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,640
mouse that's been fed so that it create

466
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,000
it has this fatty liver and and this all

467
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,159
this collagen and you can see then the

468
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,440
uh The Binding so these Aron oxide

469
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,960
particles are bound with peptides that

470
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,880
bind to to the collagen and you can see

471
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,760
then the liver show up with these little

472
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,120
particles without using any gal ium so

473
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,559
anyway that's the end of my talk you

474
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,240
know learning how to use the nanop

475
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,520
particles was super important how they

476
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,919
interact with the body and I'm sure

477
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,919
you're going to hear more from the other

478
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,919
speakers next our speaker is Angie

479
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,880
Belcher she is the James Mason crafts

480
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,799
professor of biological engineering at

481
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,799
MIT she received her PhD from UC Santa

482
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:28,720
Barbara in chemistry her work on novel

483
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,559
nanoscale materials has been Rec

484
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,600
recognized by many prizes including the

485
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,000
MacArthur genius award and the lemelson

486
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,400
prize her lab seeks to understand and

487
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,400
harness Nature's Own processes in order

488
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,360
to design technologically important

489
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,440
materials in medicine which you'll hear

490
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,159
about today but as you all may well know

491
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,039
she also works on energy and the

492
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,000
environment um she's a close

493
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,720
collaborator and it's a real thrill to

494
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,720
have her here

495
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,840
welcome um thank you so much it's uh an

496
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,799
honor to be part of this uh this panel

497
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:07,679
um what a great topic uh and great panel

498
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,600
um I have been working on nanomaterials

499
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,240
my entire adult life um I have been

500
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,559
fascinated with natural uh materials

501
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,240
like like Abalone shells how Abalone

502
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:20,000
make U materials these are biomaterials

503
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,720
made by an organism the reason they're

504
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,200
so beautiful and so tough is because

505
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,720
they have a protein that makes it and

506
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,240
controls this type of of material um I'm

507
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,320
really lucky to work with s and part of

508
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,880
the the marble Center and um and Paula

509
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,080
Hammond as well two of my my best

510
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,919
collaborators um and I'm going to talk

511
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,440
about some of the work that we're um

512
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:43,960
that we're working on

513
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,480
today um so I work at the interface

514
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,799
between nano technology in in uh in

515
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,440
biology um and in applications and so we

516
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:53,960
work on energy Health Care in the

517
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,440
environment and just like this organism

518
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,600
the Abalone um used proteins and used

519
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,919
DNA to make proteins to control exquis

520
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,120
init control over calcium carbonate

521
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:06,000
nano-based materials what our lab has

522
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:08,400
done is evolve organisms to have

523
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,200
proteins to genetically control anything

524
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,760
we want on the periodic table uh and

525
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,679
we've worked on I think 135 materials in

526
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,279
the last couple of years that now we can

527
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,840
genetically control at the nanoc scale

528
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,840
so um I always say I've never been

529
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:23,720
accused of focusing um and we we focus

530
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,600
on making these nanomaterials for all

531
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,600
these different applications from energy

532
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,360
to the environment to uh Therapeutics

533
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,679
and we've spun out several companies on

534
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:37,080
this today I'm going to focus on on uh

535
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:39,360
Imaging um so um we work also like in

536
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,559
Professor Bundy's um very beautiful talk

537
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,360
we also work on on Imaging with

538
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:47,760
nanomaterials um and we also work on not

539
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,600
Imaging with um with without label so

540
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,720
label free Imaging and we use

541
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,320
hyperspectral Imaging and Hyper diffuse

542
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,200
Imaging in near ir1 um and near ir2 so

543
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,200
we're interested in imaging between

544
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,720
about 800 and 1,800

545
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,679
nanometers um and hypers um spectral

546
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,400
imaging has been used um for a long time

547
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,640
for non-destructive food inspection and

548
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,760
remote sensing but when you shift to the

549
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,760
near IR when you shift to Imaging above

550
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,840
a th000 nanometers you start to be able

551
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,080
to see things at much greater depth as

552
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,240
as Professor buend showed a few minutes

553
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,159
ago um and we developed a technology

554
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:26,440
called dolphin um which um which we can

555
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:29,440
look up to 8 cm inside of a um of a

556
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,279
tissue or an animal to look for um for

557
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,640
tiny

558
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:36,000
tumors um and we we develop these data

559
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:40,960
cubes we do three 3D reconstruction on

560
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,400
it U I wanted to to tell um us well okay

561
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,120
so one of the things that's really

562
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,600
interesting as was referred to before is

563
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,120
you know when you start to sh shift to

564
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,840
these wavelength there's less dyes and

565
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,960
um probes that you can use so there's

566
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,039
organic dyes that are uh in the uh in

567
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,600
the IR they don't tend to be as stable

568
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,559
there's um Quantum dots which we learned

569
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,600
a lot about there single um tube carbon

570
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:03,600
uh single W carbon nanot tubes and rare

571
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,799
earth nanop particles and so we're using

572
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,039
an indium Gallum Mara detector to to

573
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:10,520
look um at tissue and samples at depth

574
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,320
and so in my lab we've worked on

575
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,840
developing many different kinds of

576
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,919
nanomaterials to be able to look at

577
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,720
these um some of which are making um

578
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,600
single wall carbon nanot tubes U

579
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,600
brighter some are using plasmon enhanced

580
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,240
near1 D um to look for tiny tumors and

581
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,640
ovarian cancer as well as rare earth

582
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,640
nanop particles for doing uh single cell

583
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,400
tracking I want to show you an example

584
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,279
of something that we went from idea to

585
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,640
Clinic um in 3 years and this is a

586
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:42,520
collaboration with my um postto Jeremy

587
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,480
Lee shown here um this work was all

588
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,320
funded um through the um through the

589
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,080
marble um Center at at MIT we actually

590
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,400
applied for NIH um funding for this

591
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:55,480
twice and got um got rejected um but the

592
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,480
idea was that um that we could use um

593
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,279
short wavelength infrared and orthogonal

594
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,559
polarization to see lymph nodes and so

595
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:05,120
what you see um up here is um what this

596
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,880
is human tissue where there's a lymph

597
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,640
node you really can't see it but if

598
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,960
you're Imaging it uh at particular

599
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,640
wavelengths and particular polarizations

600
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,120
you can see the difference in contrast

601
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,679
for the for the lymph nodes and so what

602
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,840
um what Jeremy incision Vision did and

603
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:23,440
we want a a best 2023 invention and also

604
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,520
a moonshot from um President Biden for

605
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,960
for this is we um we invented a

606
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,279
technology where when a patient's

607
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,960
undergoing colon cancer um they take a

608
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,480
bunch of tissue out and they take a

609
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,080
bunch of tissue out and they probe with

610
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,640
their fingers to find lymph nodes and

611
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,799
they have to look for 10 at least 10

612
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,520
different lymph nodes it's different for

613
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:42,120
different kinds of surgery um what what

614
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,720
Jeremy did was invented a technology

615
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,399
that when that that tissue comes out of

616
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,279
the patient it goes over to um a

617
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:49,640
technology called Envision where you can

618
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,120
quickly count how many lymph nodes there

619
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,919
are you go okay here's 10 lymph nodes I

620
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,720
don't have to go back and get more and

621
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,039
so it actually really speeds up the

622
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,919
process of uh looking for lymph nodes

623
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:02,799
and classifying them for disease and so

624
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,840
um we it was um idea to clinic in 3

625
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,840
years we're now in 15 hospitals and

626
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,960
multiple companies and looking at breast

627
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,000
cancer colon cancer and prostate uh

628
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:15,240
cancer and so this was this was all

629
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,799
based on this um near uh Imaging and so

630
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,440
um there's all these lymph nodes uh in

631
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,559
the body um and the idea was to use a

632
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,320
combination of uh of NE um and

633
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,200
polarization to be able to find the

634
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,159
right wavelength to be able to pull out

635
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,480
these materials and this is in a mouse

636
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,159
you you can see the lymph node here you

637
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,919
can actually see this is all without

638
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:35,600
staining you can see lymph vessels um

639
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,919
here we're looking at adant response

640
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,080
during monitoring in real time in mice

641
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:43,120
and this is before the adant and 24

642
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,279
after so it's very non-invasive way of

643
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,039
uh of Imaging um animals or or people

644
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:49,919
samples and then you can really get a

645
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,960
lot of new information about lymph nodes

646
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,399
inside the body and look at size

647
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,080
symmetry border Clarity um vessel

648
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:58,679
patterns and from there start to try to

649
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,440
um understand and predict dis disease

650
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:03,000
and we've done that in triple negative

651
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,200
breast cancer where we we have um

652
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,679
animals that we're monitoring on a

653
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,840
day-to-day basis or twice a day um

654
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,600
monitoring changes in the lymph nodes

655
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,480
and what we see is that there's this

656
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,279
great increase in lymph node size um in

657
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,120
the animals that end up um becoming

658
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,640
metastic okay that's that story that's

659
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,000
all label-free Imaging so I'm driving to

660
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,880
work one day and I'm I'm listening to

661
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,559
the news and I hear about this um this

662
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,039
asteroid called asteroid benu have you

663
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,440
heard about this asteroid before so I

664
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:34,080
don't work on asteroids I would love to

665
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,840
work on asteroids I do not but what what

666
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,039
NASA did was they they sent a probe 63

667
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:44,039
million miles to an asteroid that was

668
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:48,000
traveling at 63 um 63,000 mil per hour

669
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:51,600
and is about 16 1 ft uh across they

670
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,559
landed on it they grabbed rocks from it

671
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,640
they did a biopsy of an asteroid moving

672
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:00,480
in space collected them took pictures

673
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:03,679
and sent it back back and you can see

674
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,360
the the uh the images I mean there it is

675
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,399
they have pictures of it landing and

676
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,799
this is an incredible feet and it cost

677
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:15,320
$1.16 billion which was well worth it

678
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:17,799
right but and yet in 2024 we cannot go

679
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:20,200
this far inside of a woman's abdomen to

680
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:22,559
find a 1 mm tumor you can't tell me

681
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,240
that's not possible if we can biopsy an

682
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,039
asteroid surely we can look this far

683
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,440
inside of an abdomen to find a tiny

684
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,120
tumor so I think that we just haven't

685
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,200
tried hard enough we haven't had enough

686
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,760
Engineers working on it and so we think

687
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,840
it's unacceptable so here's the team

688
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,240
that's working on this um you all know

689
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,240
Sangita Paula Hammond kppa Varanasi and

690
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,559
our um our collaborator Becky Stone

691
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,600
who's head of gynecological oncology um

692
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:51,519
at John Hopkins we think that you should

693
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,640
be able to diagnose ovarian cancer at

694
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:57,679
much early stages at stages where you

695
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,760
can also intercept it um so why ovarian

696
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,159
cancer one woman is diagnosed with stage

697
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,799
three or stage four every three minutes

698
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:09,559
worldwide the fiveyear survival rate is

699
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:12,720
39% for stage four and 177% for stage

700
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:15,039
177% for stage 4 um and this the

701
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,760
survival rate has not improved in 20

702
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:21,679
years

703
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:24,240
okay um the the the rates haven't in

704
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,279
improved um and there's a lot there's a

705
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,240
lot that needs to be understood about

706
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:31,600
ovarian cancer and so I I um am not

707
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,480
accepting that so there was a large

708
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,799
scale clinical trial out of the UK

709
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:40,679
recently which said that patients that

710
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:42,600
underwent CA 125 um blood test um and

711
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,360
transvaginal ultrasound there was no

712
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,200
increase in

713
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,320
survivability which means there is no

714
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,600
screen for ovarian cancer and again as

715
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,840
an engineer you throw up your hands you

716
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,080
said impossible there has to be a way of

717
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,480
being able to detect it detect it early

718
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,720
here's another thing about ovarian

719
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,880
cancer is that ovarian canc doesn't come

720
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,399
from the ovaries 85% of ovarian cancer

721
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,679
comes from the fallopian tube it's a

722
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:07,760
fallopian tube origin it comes from the

723
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,159
fallopian tube it sits on the Fallopian

724
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,360
tubes for sometimes up to 9 years before

725
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,799
it starts to to become cancer and starts

726
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:18,840
to metastasize we have a window of years

727
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,159
to be able to detect it and intercept

728
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,399
before it becomes stage two stage three

729
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,600
stage four when it is

730
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:27,399
treatable um and so what happens is you

731
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,120
have a little mutation called a p53

732
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:31,080
mutation it starts to come into

733
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,880
something called a stick stick lesion

734
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,559
and then develops into ovarian cancer

735
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,720
over a year period of time now we also

736
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:39,080
know that women that have their

737
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,120
Fallopian tubes taken out this is also

738
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,799
another large scale clinical trial out

739
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,360
of Canada um women that have their

740
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,000
Fallopian tubes taken out after

741
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:49,039
childbearing years zero cases of ovarian

742
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,880
cancer it's a way of preventing ovarian

743
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,399
cancer is removing your fallopian tubes

744
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,880
which says that it's another way of uh

745
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,480
of of showing that it comes from the uh

746
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,039
the Fallopian tubes so we've embraced

747
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,360
the goal of developing accessible

748
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,320
detection and Diagnostics technology for

749
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,320
ovarian cancer in the next 5 to 10 years

750
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,480
and that's with my partners and we won't

751
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,480
accept um failure on this this is

752
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,960
something we plan on doing one of the

753
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,519
ways we're doing it in my lab is we're

754
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,679
taking that technology that we talked

755
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,720
about called dolphin earlier and some of

756
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,519
the the work from Invision um and we've

757
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,840
uh developed something called EK to be

758
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:24,960
able to scan Fallopian tubes that come

759
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,159
from the o o so it was during the

760
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,960
pandemic and I was on it was during the

761
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:32,320
pandemic and I was on a zoom call and my

762
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,720
I met Becky Stone who's a surgeon at

763
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,519
John's Hopkins and she was saying that

764
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,200
when a woman uh has her phian tubes

765
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,240
taken out sometimes opportunistically um

766
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,320
as a way of preventing ovarian cancer or

767
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,399
if she has a genetic mutation that leads

768
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:49,200
to ovarian cancer that they take the the

769
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:51,640
tubes are like about this big they take

770
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,640
the tubes and they embed them in wax and

771
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,919
they cut them and they look at 0.1% of

772
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,240
them she goes if only we had a way of

773
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,000
looking at a whole fallopian tube i' met

774
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,000
her before but I instant messaged her

775
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,240
which is advanced technology for me um

776
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,399
and I said we can design a system to do

777
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,559
that it's actually pretty easy so we

778
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,799
adapted dolphin to EK so now when a

779
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:13,559
patient under goes um has her Fallopian

780
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:15,399
tubes removed from John's Hopkins

781
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:18,000
they're put into organ transport media

782
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:20,080
and FedEx to us overnight where we scan

783
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,960
the whole fallopian tube either using

784
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,440
nanoparticle probes for particular

785
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,360
markers for pre-cancer lesions or

786
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,639
collecting enough data using

787
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,720
hyperspectral Imaging to try to look for

788
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:32,600
interesting spectral characteristics

789
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,159
that would show us that the pathologist

790
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,480
needs to go in and look

791
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,760
here I was really overconfident I'm a

792
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,120
professor so I don't actually do any of

793
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,399
the work I was overconfident that my

794
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,200
students could actually do it and they

795
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,880
did um they we also used these um IR um

796
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,320
dyes which are not very bright or very

797
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,200
stable but when you complex them with

798
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,880
Nano particles of gold it actually makes

799
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,200
them U much much brighter um and this is

800
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,279
the the team that is uh working on these

801
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,960
and our idea is to move diagnosis back

802
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:05,720
to where it can be treated um much much

803
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,159
easier and much much

804
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,200
better um here's what a fallopian tube

805
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,080
looks like it just came out of a patient

806
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:17,559
um it comes to us um we track it um with

807
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,840
asset Panda um we start Imaging and so

808
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:21,240
when I would go to these meetings um um

809
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,200
Radiologists would say Fallopian tubes

810
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,120
are

811
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,440
invisible uh you can't see them by um

812
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,960
contrast enhanced CT can't see them by

813
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,880
Ultra sound they're invisible and I'm

814
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,519
like an engineer I'm like okay they're

815
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,320
not invisible right you have to be able

816
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,679
to be able to to find them and so when

817
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,200
you find the right wavelength of

818
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,760
exitation and the right wavelength of of

819
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,279
emission They're Not Invisible so we

820
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,720
hyperspectral scan them we find these

821
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,880
wavelengths that works and so now we can

822
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,440
we can follow them um and this is a a a

823
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,320
patient that um that we scanned we found

824
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,639
a region um and we marked it we sent it

825
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,440
back to John's Hopkins where they took

826
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,639
it and they they went to our Mark they

827
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,279
did pathology on it and they found an

828
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:03,519
adnormal region that was

829
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:05,960
250 um micrometers in size so you would

830
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,600
have never seen it um otherwise so we

831
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:12,600
scanned a 5 cm tube and found a a a a

832
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,279
pre-cancer lesion that was 250 microns

833
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,639
and so you say well that's kind of cool

834
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:21,519
what do you do there well now um

835
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:23,720
um now Sangita is going in and trying to

836
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,799
find biomarkers for these so so we're

837
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,760
doing the Imaging Sangita is looking for

838
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,880
biomarkers and ways of amplifying the

839
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,000
signal so you'd be able to tell from

840
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:35,600
urine blood or um or other uh fluid um

841
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,960
that you actually had a pre-cancer

842
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,960
Legion um Professor varasi is going in

843
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,200
with technology he's developed to pick

844
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,279
up some of these cells so we can culture

845
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,679
them live because there are no cultures

846
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,440
alive of these pre-cancer lesions and

847
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,880
Paula Hammond is working on developing

848
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,000
um layer by layer um Therapeutics

849
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,960
Immunology Therapeutics that would

850
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,200
actually work on trying to treat a very

851
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,799
early pre cancer lesion or maybe even

852
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,200
prevent it we're also looking at

853
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,120
vaccines can you develop a vaccine for

854
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,399
pre-cancer lesion so that the patient

855
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,879
never develops aarian cancer so we also

856
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,440
um are on a platform this was uh

857
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:15,919
developed by uh Dr Gross um John's

858
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,839
Hopkins and pit to where we're trying to

859
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:22,879
to turn on its head um like the

860
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,280
Henrietta LAX idea of um of your not

861
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,520
having your control of your own samples

862
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,639
so um there's an app that the patients

863
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,720
get yet they know that their Fallopian

864
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,079
tubes were taken out they see them going

865
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,960
to uh MIT they see images of their

866
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,159
Fallopian tubes um they can uh interact

867
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,000
with the scientist and they can they own

868
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,480
their own bios specimen they they track

869
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,599
their own bios specimens um we say this

870
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,520
is bed to bside and back again um but it

871
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:50,960
is a team effort it's a team effort of

872
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,200
all these scientists and Engineers

873
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,919
Physicians and the patients the patients

874
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,660
are an active an important part of this

875
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:08,570
and so thank you for your attention

876
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:08,570
[Applause]

877
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,560
you can see why we're having so much fun

878
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,720
um in the nanom medicine space um okay

879
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,400
uh last but but not least we're so

880
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,160
excited to invite Bob Langer here he is

881
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,240
one of nine Institute professors at

882
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,000
MIT um Bob trained at Cornell and MIT

883
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,240
before joining the faculty in 19 1978

884
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,920
his work on materials for sustained drug

885
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:37,400
delivery and Engineering new tissues has

886
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,560
been recognized by so so so many awards

887
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,520
but um I'll just list a couple the US

888
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,920
national medal of science the US

889
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,119
national medal of technology and

890
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,560
Innovation the Queen Elizabeth prize for

891
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,240
engineering and the Breakthrough prize

892
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,440
in life sciences Bob's patents have been

893
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,319
licensed to over 400 companies across

894
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,520
pharmaceutical chemical biotech and

895
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:58,480
medical device sectors and he is the

896
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,040
most cited engineer in history a current

897
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,520
focus of the lab is the study and

898
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,839
development of polymers to to deliver

899
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,800
DNA and RNA and genetically engineered

900
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:10,319
proteins continuously and at controlled

901
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,140
rates for prolonged periods of time it's

902
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:19,440
a great pleasure to invite

903
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:22,240
[Applause]

904
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,960
Boba well thank you boy I I really

905
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:28,400
enjoyed the the talks that's just great

906
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,040
work that mie and Angie are doing

907
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,240
um so I thought I'd tell you a little

908
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,760
bit about how I got started in this area

909
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,240
which was very I think kind of unusual

910
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,839
so my background is chemical engineering

911
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,560
and when I got done with my degree in

912
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:45,280
1974 you know for those of you that were

913
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,960
old enough I was 50 years ago there was

914
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,839
like this gas shortage and if you lived

915
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,079
in Boston you actually had to wait in

916
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:53,520
line for two hours to get your car tank

917
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:54,960
filled up but the consequence of that is

918
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,960
that if you were a chemical engineer you

919
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,000
got a lot of job offers from oil

920
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,920
companies and pretty much all my

921
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,880
classmates that's what they did and I

922
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:07,160
thought that's what I do too so I you

923
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:10,480
know I actually got 20 job offers from

924
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,440
oil companies four from Exxon alone and

925
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,680
and and really I wasn't that good at all

926
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,599
but they just had so many openings but

927
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,079
when I went to some of these you know

928
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:19,720
they tell you you know if you could just

929
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,680
increase the yield of of one of these

930
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,160
Petro chemicals by a tiny percentage

931
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,200
they said that'd be wonderful be worth

932
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,160
billions of dollars but I remember

933
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,079
flying back to Boston that night from

934
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,599
Texas

935
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,400
thinking to myself that I I really

936
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,880
didn't want to spend my life doing that

937
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,200
so I started to think about other ways I

938
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,839
could use my chemical engineering

939
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,359
background to to to help people and I I

940
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,960
won't go through the whole story but in

941
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,359
the end what I did is I had this idea of

942
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,760
maybe doing something in medicine

943
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,920
because nobody would hire me for a lot

944
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,760
of other things so I wrote to a lot of

945
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,720
hospitals and medical schools and and

946
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,560
none of them would write me back but

947
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,920
finally one of the people in the lab I

948
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,839
was said to me he said Bob there's a

949
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,880
surgeon in Boston at Harvard in

950
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,160
Children's Hospital named Judah folman

951
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,680
and he said sometimes he hired unusual

952
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,040
people he he thought very highly of Dr

953
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,520
folkman I won't say what he thought

954
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,280
about me but Dr folman had this idea

955
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,280
that if you could stop blood vessels you

956
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,960
might be able to stop cancer and that

957
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,480
and that it was actually mediated

958
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,880
chemically which turns out it was a

959
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,359
super controversial idea since I didn't

960
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,720
know anything about biology I thought it

961
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,520
was a great idea but um at any rate one

962
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,000
of the biggest problems or the biggest

963
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,760
problem is there's really no way to

964
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,280
study blood vessels because wherever

965
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,560
you'd go there were background blood

966
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,960
vessels except for a couple places like

967
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,119
the corne of certain animals and the

968
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,920
chick coral and Tech membrane had

969
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:46,000
actually very few so what we our idea

970
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,000
was we put certain tumors in in in these

971
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,119
tiny little animal eyes and then we need

972
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,280
a tiny which would cause blood vessels

973
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,359
to grow but then we needed a a tiny

974
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,920
delivery system like a nanoparticle or

975
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:59,400
microparticle that could deliver large

976
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,319
molecules our Dr folman's theory was

977
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,920
that they were all and mine too was that

978
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:07,440
they were all large molecules that would

979
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:09,560
do this so at this time 1974 the idea of

980
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,119
having an advanced Drug delivery system

981
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,920
you know was pretty much unheard of

982
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,920
there was only one company in the world

983
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,640
company called alza uh that was

984
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,119
developing these systems and late they

985
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,520
had done approved but later they'd come

986
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,760
out with what are called transdermal

987
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,280
Delivery Systems and things like that Dr

988
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,200
folman was on their board he went out

989
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,920
there he asked them could they help but

990
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,839
they all told them it was impossible

991
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,280
they basically Bally said that the

992
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:32,160
molecules that we were talking about

993
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,920
were too big it's like walking through a

994
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,520
wall so uh but if we were going to solve

995
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,400
the the the um the blood vessel problem

996
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,440
we had to solve this bioassay problem so

997
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,119
I spent several years working on this

998
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,319
experimenting with different materials

999
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:48,160
lipids polymers other things uh

1000
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:50,640
different designs uh different

1001
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,520
procedures and I actually found over 200

1002
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,040
different ways to get this to not

1003
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,079
work but but eventually we were able to

1004
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,599
make little microparticles

1005
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:01,760
like shown on the left or nanop

1006
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,800
particles cut in half on the right and

1007
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,040
we published in the journal Nature in

1008
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,200
1976 for the first time that you could

1009
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,280
release any large molecules also the

1010
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,560
first uh study that ever showed you

1011
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,920
could deliver nucleic acids which would

1012
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,280
include DNA and RNA now uh I would like

1013
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,359
to tell you that this met with you know

1014
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,760
people were very excited about it but in

1015
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:24,960
fact it was kind of the opposite I

1016
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,680
remember three months before this I got

1017
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,720
asked I was giving a talk at a major

1018
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,560
scientific meting meeting it was

1019
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,760
actually the first talk in my life that

1020
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:35,079
I gave at one of these meetings I was it

1021
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,359
was 48 years ago uh in Michigan and I

1022
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:39,920
practice this talk for weeks into a tape

1023
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,839
recorder and finally the day came and I

1024
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,640
got up and I gave the talk and you know

1025
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,200
I felt I did all right I didn't forget

1026
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,240
too much what I was going to say or

1027
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,800
stammer too much so I thought when I was

1028
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:52,200
done with this talk all these older

1029
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,680
engineers and chemists being nice people

1030
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,480
would would want to encourage me this

1031
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,400
young guy but when I got done I stepped

1032
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,960
off the podium and a whole bunch of them

1033
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,839
came up to me and they said well we

1034
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,760
don't believe anything you just said um

1035
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,440
and and and this again they said the

1036
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,240
molecules were too big and the solvents

1037
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,839
we were using like methylene chloride

1038
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,520
and and ethanol would destroy whatever

1039
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:14,480
we put in and actually things went

1040
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:17,040
downhill for me from there if that were

1041
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,400
possible I tried to get research grants

1042
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,240
to support my work and my first nine

1043
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,079
were very soundly rejected and then you

1044
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,160
know I love being a postet children's

1045
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,599
hospital but a lot of my friends said

1046
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,079
you know maybe you shouldn't do that

1047
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,960
your whole life and so I I did I started

1048
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,599
looking for faculty jobs and since I'm a

1049
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,240
chemical engineer I applied to chemical

1050
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,119
engineering departments no chemical

1051
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,880
engineering department in the world

1052
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,160
offered me a position I finally got a

1053
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,440
job in the Nutrition department here

1054
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:48,400
it's a long story I won't go all into

1055
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:50,160
that but anyhow so um but so so anyhow

1056
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,200
but I and then I had some other ideas

1057
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,920
munie referred to one of them that was

1058
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,480
maybe a little bit different I I I

1059
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,800
wanted to see the work I did get get to

1060
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,319
out to the world and I was so naive I

1061
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,520
thought if I published papers people

1062
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:08,040
would just use them it didn't work out

1063
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:09,680
that way um but so I also wrote patents

1064
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,359
and then I even got involved in starting

1065
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,240
companies and as Zang mentioned

1066
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:15,200
licensing things to companies and

1067
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:17,760
because of that which actually had a lot

1068
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,920
of opposition and ridicule also even at

1069
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,520
MIT back almost 40 50 years ago there

1070
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,599
were a lot of products based on on this

1071
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,880
uh you know all over the world from

1072
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,079
companies we've started or worked with

1073
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,880
uh ranging from new treatments for

1074
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,920
prostate cancer uh endometriosis

1075
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,960
schizophr all kinds of things hundreds

1076
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,480
of millions of people you use these

1077
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,599
these are all like implants or

1078
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,839
microspheres but if you didn't use them

1079
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,720
the drugs would get destroyed uh even

1080
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,800
opioid addiction is up there from one of

1081
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,359
the things we started but that being

1082
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,680
said you know when like I say a lot of

1083
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,880
these might be

1084
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:55,480
microspheres or even implants like the

1085
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,160
drug alluding stent which I put up here

1086
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,040
U but the thing is is that when you make

1087
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,680
particles smaller you can using the

1088
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,520
approaches we wrote in the nature paper

1089
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,760
it works but sometimes they stick

1090
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:09,440
together and Aggregate and and sometimes

1091
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,240
macras eat them so working with Vladimir

1092
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,000
torchilin and others we had this idea

1093
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,800
you could take something in Miralax like

1094
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,400
polyethylene glycol and coat these and

1095
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,920
that was a paper we wrote 30 years ago

1096
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,559
uh cited uh I think about 4,000 times

1097
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,160
and you could even go further and put

1098
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,640
targeting molecules on these which only

1099
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,760
faric Asad did in our lab I always

1100
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,520
explain this badly but Nova the TV show

1101
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,400
they made a video of what we did and

1102
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,280
it's so much better explanation than

1103
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,000
anything I could do so here it is he

1104
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,599
starts with a nanop particle of

1105
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,800
anti-cancer drug that gets encased in a

1106
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:48,119
plastic that releases the drug over time

1107
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,359
that in turn gets a special wrapping

1108
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:52,800
that disguises the package as a water

1109
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:55,720
molecule to fool the body's immune

1110
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,920
system and last but not least the

1111
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,359
address where it should be delivered

1112
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,760
a key that will only fit the lock of

1113
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:02,760
cancer

1114
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,640
cells yeah you can see why it does a

1115
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:13,160
better job than I do um I should say a

1116
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,880
lot of the clinicians I work with tell

1117
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,920
me it doesn't really blow the cell up

1118
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:21,000
like that but the idea is you could use

1119
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,760
this for small molecules or for genetic

1120
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,440
therapy you could use these approaches

1121
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:27,800
for with lipids or polymers and so forth

1122
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,880
and one of the things of course over the

1123
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,000
years and you know we've worked on these

1124
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,800
for a long time but if you look at

1125
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,599
various people including Phil sharp at

1126
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:38,559
MIT and and others they say really if

1127
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:41,760
you want to deliver genetic therapies

1128
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:45,040
the biggest problem to solve would be um

1129
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,520
would be delivery and so over the years

1130
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,520
I felt we could do that and even start

1131
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,160
companies in that there were about five

1132
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:54,079
things that we did one showing that you

1133
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,800
could deliver nucleic acids back in that

1134
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,640
nature paper even though people said it

1135
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,359
was impossible that then the idea of Peg

1136
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,960
then the idea of what's called I

1137
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:05,760
ionizable substances because if you make

1138
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:09,000
things charged initially it might cause

1139
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,440
toxicity but if you so if you make them

1140
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,440
neutral at regular pH and then get

1141
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,960
charged inside the cell they can get in

1142
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,559
out out of the endone Dan pack who's now

1143
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,280
at University of Kentucky postto of ours

1144
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,839
and David putam showed this in the year

1145
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,280
2000 and then other people uh Advanced

1146
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:27,920
that in the lipid field as well then Dan

1147
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,280
Anderson who was a post With Me Now full

1148
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,720
professor at MIT had this idea of making

1149
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,160
thousands of different lipids libraries

1150
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,200
so you could have your choice of what

1151
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,720
ones are going to work well and finally

1152
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,119
roohi carnik who was a postto with me

1153
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,400
now a professor at MIT in mechanical

1154
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,359
engineering had the idea of using micro

1155
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,119
fluidics to to make a lot of these and

1156
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,480
so all these were published you know

1157
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,160
something like 20 years ago so I I

1158
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,040
certainly and we had patents on some of

1159
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,440
them so I thought well you could create

1160
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,440
these products so a couple companies I

1161
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,440
thought I'd just give an example uh this

1162
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,800
is on this is from Al nyum which Phil

1163
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,800
sharp was a founder of and I was on the

1164
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,839
founding scientific Advisory Board this

1165
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,359
product was the first uh nanop particle

1166
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,800
approved by the FDA for delivering uh

1167
00:46:10,359 --> 00:46:16,079
RNA it was actually done by aenna Kink

1168
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:18,880
who was MIT student working in in my lab

1169
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:21,119
uh started uh and and now he's CEO of

1170
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,599
his own company and then of course the

1171
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,520
other one that I should show you which

1172
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:28,400
was alluded to by Sangita early on is I

1173
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,520
I helped start this company with new

1174
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,440
baray and whose thesis committee I was

1175
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:36,200
on and now on the MIT Corporation um and

1176
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,599
and two others to create nanop particles

1177
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,280
that could protect messenger RNA and of

1178
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:43,160
course that led to the covid vaccine

1179
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,599
which is now used all over the world um

1180
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,880
and and you see almost every other

1181
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,480
attempt at at trying to make this

1182
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:52,319
vaccine didn't really work uh only two

1183
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,160
companies madna and bio entech both

1184
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,640
using lipid nanop particles and

1185
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,000
messenger RNA got these approved and and

1186
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,000
that's the tip of the iceberg you're

1187
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,200
going to see I think new cancer vaccines

1188
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,520
and other things on the last slide I

1189
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,319
just wanted to say areas that maybe we

1190
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,680
can do better on and these are things

1191
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:10,000
that we're actually working on with

1192
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,119
funding from the from the marble Center

1193
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,520
and from The Gates found and from with

1194
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:16,680
Bill Gates but and I'll just really list

1195
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,640
them but reactogenicity could you

1196
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,680
immunogenicity could you make them less

1197
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,880
immunogenic so that if if you gave a

1198
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,160
drug you know you wouldn't get an immune

1199
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,000
reaction more immunogenic maybe having

1200
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,000
what's called ad property so that you

1201
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,319
could get a better long even a better

1202
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,319
immune response longer shelf life which

1203
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:36,480
Sangita actually mentioned in her very

1204
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:38,119
introductory remarks so you can ship

1205
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,200
these all over the world Anna Jackal

1206
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:41,640
lenic in our lab working with the Gates

1207
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,319
Foundation has been doing a lot of work

1208
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,000
on that targeting to specific cells

1209
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,359
which Dan Anderson and I have been

1210
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,520
working on other materials there's all

1211
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:51,800
kinds of materials that may be useful

1212
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,960
right now when you use lipid

1213
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,160
nanoparticles people use four but maybe

1214
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,599
you don't necessarily need that many and

1215
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:59,720
could you come up with with things that

1216
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:01,400
might work better than Peg finally could

1217
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,319
you cross barriers that right now you

1218
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,040
cannot cross like the bloodb brain

1219
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:07,079
barrier which could be helpful in

1220
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,480
Alzheimer's and other diseases so those

1221
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:10,640
are just a few of the things that we're

1222
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,119
thinking about and working on and thank

1223
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,119
you very much for for having

1224
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:24,559
[Applause]

1225
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,559
me thank you Bob well thank

1226
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:28,760
you you can go all the way down

1227
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,680
then middle thank

1228
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,520
you all right well um for those of you

1229
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,000
not in medicine hopefully that was a

1230
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,359
little bit of like rapid fire medical

1231
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,079
school education and you're excited

1232
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:53,160
about what nanotechnology can do in

1233
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,720
medicine um this is a time for some Q&A

1234
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:57,760
from the audience we have a whole bunch

1235
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:00,400
of things coming in on this um

1236
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,119
fancy new app I don't know what we call

1237
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,559
this um let's

1238
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,359
see maybe we can start with there's some

1239
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:10,240
pretty specific questions um and

1240
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:13,319
interest on near infrared wavelengths um

1241
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,400
maybe for um Muji and and Angie thinking

1242
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:18,040
about you know what's the promise of

1243
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,480
near infrared Imaging how far can things

1244
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,119
go how could we make it better do we

1245
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,839
need new materials what are your

1246
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:27,000
thoughts on

1247
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:29,000
that um how I think it's a um very

1248
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,319
exciting uh field I think there's a lot

1249
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,839
of opportunity because I think it's an

1250
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:35,720
early development um I don't know if you

1251
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,520
mean how far can it go in terms of how

1252
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:41,040
deep can it go the deepest we've gone is

1253
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:44,400
about 8 cm and it depends on the

1254
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:47,079
material type right now um I mean that

1255
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,880
it depends on the the type of uh of

1256
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:52,839
tissue um and do we need new materials I

1257
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,920
think that we definitely need new

1258
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:58,839
materials um U and I think that m showed

1259
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:02,079
some really uh exciting new materials

1260
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:06,480
around that that area um you know we

1261
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:08,920
hope to be able to to use it um for um

1262
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,079
actually uh ovarian cancer um breast

1263
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,680
cancer and colon cancer in the next few

1264
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:15,839
years and we're working on um

1265
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,079
technologies that you'd be able to to

1266
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:21,520
see it um you know inside

1267
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:24,319
patients great M yeah so I I think uh

1268
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,839
it's a very exciting area um I think the

1269
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:29,760
label-free work that you've done I think

1270
00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:32,720
there's a lot to do there as well just

1271
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:36,960
because you know normal tissue doesn't

1272
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:40,160
really flues in the near for in the swe

1273
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,160
um but pathological tissues tend to have

1274
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,920
some signature there so you can you can

1275
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,720
uh do multispectral imaging there and

1276
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,720
really see things new materials would be

1277
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,079
great different kinds of uh Optical

1278
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,960
tricks like what you've done with the

1279
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,160
polarization for instance um you know I

1280
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,280
don't know how deep you can go but

1281
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,680
there's a lot of lot of things you can

1282
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,240
do without going too deep there are many

1283
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,799
parts of the body where you can don't

1284
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,559
have to go more than a few centimeters

1285
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:07,880
in to really see things um so I think

1286
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,440
there's a I think there's a lot to do

1287
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,799
there for sure yeah I think that's a

1288
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,440
great point I mean one thing that may

1289
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:15,880
not be on everyone's radar is the

1290
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,720
advances in surgery um you can actually

1291
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:21,240
get into most compartments now with

1292
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,680
robotic surgery or endoscopy and and so

1293
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,799
you know you could probably get pretty

1294
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,440
close to almost everything actually even

1295
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:29,520
for Optics yeah

1296
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,240
um so there's another question I think

1297
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,640
we talked about the excitement of

1298
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:36,400
getting these Technologies into patients

1299
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,880
and a challenge in medicine which is

1300
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,960
appropriate is that um you know we have

1301
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,200
regulatory bodies that we have to um

1302
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:47,040
collaborate with u and I I'm curious

1303
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:50,240
maybe starting with Bob first how

1304
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,079
um do you have advice for how how to do

1305
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,760
that or how has it changed I know when

1306
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,720
we started the cancer center for

1307
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,400
nanotchnology excellence that you and

1308
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:02,079
Ralph Co almost want to say 20 years ago

1309
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:04,680
right now um you know the NIH was trying

1310
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:07,760
to reform its approach to nanotechnology

1311
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:10,200
and they started a toxicology service

1312
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,200
how have you seen um you know the

1313
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,160
regulatory bodies change their

1314
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,680
perspective or not over the over the

1315
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,240
years yeah well I think that I mean it's

1316
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,000
a great question I don't know that

1317
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:22,200
they've changed it that much I mean in

1318
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,319
an Emer there's a couple times that you

1319
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,079
know I mean in general are very

1320
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,319
conservative I mean the idea is first Do

1321
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,880
no harm

1322
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:33,359
and so and I think always the the

1323
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,119
concern that you might do something bad

1324
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:37,440
is there but there have been a couple

1325
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:41,359
cases couple situations both in the AIDS

1326
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:44,799
crisis uh back in the 90s uh and more

1327
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:47,680
recently with the co uh you know issue

1328
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:49,599
where they approve things much much more

1329
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,599
rapidly I mean I think at the end of the

1330
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:55,280
day people make it they make a decision

1331
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:57,200
right which is the risk reward ratio

1332
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,480
that that when the risk is so high and

1333
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,160
so many people are dying and there's no

1334
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:05,559
real treatment then then they do things

1335
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:09,119
faster in terms of advice I mean really

1336
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:11,480
I mean I think that what you do is you

1337
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,160
want to bring them in early rather than

1338
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,440
later you know if you have a product

1339
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,280
that's different you know it's good to

1340
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:21,640
talk to some of the people there or who

1341
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:25,000
used to work work there um so but but I

1342
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:26,720
mean it's it's a long road yeah I think

1343
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,400
precedent and collaboration are are

1344
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,280
really important and as you point out I

1345
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,960
think now that these materials have been

1346
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,960
in so many millions of people at least

1347
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,040
that's a precedented material right that

1348
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,520
we can leverage for other applications

1349
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,480
so you talked about cancer vaccines or

1350
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,200
other applications of those same four

1351
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:47,000
lipids um you hopefully the hurdles for

1352
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,359
them will be less High um because

1353
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,720
they've been shown to be safe at least

1354
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,880
in some

1355
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:54,480
applications mui we were talking before

1356
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:58,160
the session about um The Long Road the

1357
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:00,760
long road and also um um sort of parsing

1358
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,400
the different sections of the FDA right

1359
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,119
there's a drug Division and a device

1360
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,839
division can you tell us a little bit

1361
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:08,119
about how so for instance the example of

1362
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:11,359
lumicell was a drug device combination

1363
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:13,160
where we invented a handheld device to

1364
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:16,160
be able to look within the surgical

1365
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:19,799
cavity for for fluoresence that was

1366
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:22,359
generated by this this agent which was

1367
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:23,960
regulated under the the drug division

1368
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:27,119
because it was an injectable and it was

1369
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:32,200
a small a relatively small molecule is

1370
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:34,520
a nanometer size but still drug likee um

1371
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,920
and so those two those two regulatory

1372
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:40,480
buies just don't talk to each other and

1373
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:42,799
so the device division was extremely

1374
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,599
enthusiastic and tried to bring the drug

1375
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:49,799
division along but you know they they

1376
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:53,160
just so it made it twice as hard

1377
00:54:49,799 --> 00:54:55,480
basically uh to to get approval but I

1378
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,960
think there is approval now and there's

1379
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,400
a

1380
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,200
protocol that they've developed to talk

1381
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:03,760
to each other better and hopefully in

1382
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:06,599
the future that will Grease the wheels

1383
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,240
the rular regulatory Wheels yeah it's a

1384
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:11,520
proof of concept that it can be done it

1385
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:14,799
will be a precedent Angie I think that

1386
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:17,440
um that in the case of San Vision um

1387
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:21,079
what um what Jeremy the the co-founder

1388
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:24,640
did was was quite um you quite brilliant

1389
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:27,319
which is uh he developed a technology

1390
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:30,039
that in the end the in test still goes

1391
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:32,799
through regular pathology so the

1392
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:36,039
technology that that he developed was a

1393
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:39,559
way of getting samples more quickly into

1394
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:43,240
the pathologist hands so um uh there

1395
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:45,680
wasn't the same kinds of FDA regulations

1396
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:50,000
so that the next step is um for that

1397
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:53,119
technology is um um working on um

1398
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:55,319
Inhumans and during surgery but I don't

1399
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,720
think things will go as invention wise I

1400
00:55:55,319 --> 00:56:00,240
think they'll go as fast but um but

1401
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:02,280
Regulatory and uh acceptance will not be

1402
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:04,000
as fast as it was in that in that case

1403
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:08,200
and he he thought about this long and

1404
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,400
hard um he he was very smart in in that

1405
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,880
yeah I think you know another

1406
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,680
opportunity in our space and that for

1407
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,640
early innovators is thinking about that

1408
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:18,799
clinical workflow and how to design your

1409
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,200
materials and and really where where in

1410
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,520
that process to be you mentioned you

1411
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,680
know you have to inject in the morning

1412
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,440
of the surgery and and you're talking

1413
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,039
about accelerating decision- making for

1414
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,680
pathologist but not taking the

1415
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:30,720
pathologist out of the lube which is

1416
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,280
super important um so I think that is a

1417
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,559
real important part of the ideation we

1418
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,839
have a couple minutes left so maybe we

1419
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:39,000
could just do rapid fire um I'm going to

1420
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:42,079
ask you all what you're most excited

1421
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,559
about in nanom medicine um and I'm going

1422
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,440
to start with Bob and come this way well

1423
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,559
I I mentioned one of them in the talk

1424
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:51,039
like Target you know can you target

1425
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:53,359
right now you can Target nanop particles

1426
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:55,160
to the liver pretty easily but not to

1427
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:57,119
really other parts other cells or other

1428
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,319
parts of the body including ining cancer

1429
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,880
cells so I mean I'd be excited about

1430
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:03,480
that so we Dan Anderson and I are

1431
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,760
working on those kinds of things great

1432
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,880
Angie U I love working directly with um

1433
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:10,720
the surgeons and I love working with

1434
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,079
patients I see them in clinic I see them

1435
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,520
before and after surgery I love getting

1436
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:19,400
to know them um and it makes me even

1437
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:21,480
more passionate about really trying to

1438
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,640
make an impact on ovarian cancer and

1439
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,799
that is what I'm most excited about is

1440
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:28,480
trying to impact um patients lives in a

1441
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:30,720
a positive way as an engineer I never

1442
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,240
thought that would be possible um you're

1443
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,559
a physician and engineer so you know

1444
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,920
it's it's possible but um so I'm excited

1445
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,079
about that amazing I would say that

1446
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:41,160
working very closely with the clinicians

1447
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:43,280
you actually are both so you can work

1448
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,839
closely with

1449
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,240
yourself you know learning what what the

1450
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:49,319
specifications of what you're trying to

1451
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:51,440
do have those are super important you

1452
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:53,079
can invent the greatest thing but you

1453
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,520
know like this injectable if it takes

1454
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:58,280
three days it's a non-starter right that

1455
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,680
we did and so knowing ahead of time what

1456
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,039
are the constraints so that you can

1457
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,839
design around the constraints I think

1458
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:06,079
and we know how to do that in in the

1459
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:08,200
Nano world we just have to make sure

1460
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,280
that we talk to the clinicians ahead of

1461
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:12,160
time before we start inventing things

1462
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:14,319
yeah well I think all three of you are

1463
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,960
great examples of Team science and um

1464
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,599
and why we're on such an important

1465
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,770
precipice for the field so thank you

1466
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:25,760
very much thank you thank you

1467
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:25,760
[Applause]
