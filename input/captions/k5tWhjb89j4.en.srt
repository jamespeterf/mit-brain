1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
And so now uh for the final part of the

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,560
third lecture uh where we'll talk about

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,880
the uh three crunches that you'll be uh

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,120
doing. So in the first two crunches um

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,000
we'll ask you to predict the effect of

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,000
uh held out genetic perturbations uh on

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,520
the adiposite uh gene expression

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,840
profile. So on the gene expression

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,480
profiles of uh the individual uh cells

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,519
and um the difference between crunch one

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,679
and two uh is that uh in crunch one

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,399
you'll be using this single gene uh

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,360
knockout uh data set that we spoke about

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,760
experiment one uh while in crunch two

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,640
you'll be working with this uh double

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,680
gene knockout experiment um what we

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,600
introduced earlier as experiment two

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,199
and um what we'll be evaluating on um is

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,079
first of all how you perform uh on whole

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,480
transcriptto uh predictions. So

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,840
predicting the expression level and uh

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,720
in parallel we'll also evaluate on um

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,439
the uh ability of your models to predict

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,600
the proportion of uh cells expressing

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,080
each of the programs that we've spoken

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,320
about and are interested in. So the uh

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,119
differentiation programs and uh some

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,520
metabolic programs and so we'll announce

29
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,640
winners uh separately for each of these

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,240
tasks um and uh separately for each of

31
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,880
these two uh crunches.

32
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,200
So for crunch three we'll instead uh be

33
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,159
asking you to propose new double

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,720
pertubations. So two gene knockouts uh

35
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,040
that skew the proportions of uh specific

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,680
adiposite states. So for example uh

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,680
we'll be asking you what the the top 2G

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,759
knockouts are that your model predict

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,479
will most push towards this uh

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,479
differentiated adiposite state and

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,479
initially there won't be uh new data

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,200
that uh will be generated for this

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,680
crunch but uh the winners of crunch one

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,119
and the winners of crunch 2 will have

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,880
their uh top predictions uh their top uh

46
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,119
double perturbation predictions

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,880
experimentally validated and this will

48
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,840
be the set that everyone um is

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,720
evaluating. ated against

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,120
um so everyone should participate. Okay,

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,200
so that's it for the introductory uh

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,760
lecture series. Thank you for following

53
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,920
along and we can't wait to see uh what

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,920
you create.
