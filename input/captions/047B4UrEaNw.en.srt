1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,400
all right welcome back to 61200 we

2
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:18,080
continue probability and not only that

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,640
we continue on expectation today that we

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,320
also get to a second measure of distri

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,080
of random variables which is variance

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,560
but first most of today will be uh

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,520
expectation remember what we did last

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,000
class so uh for random variable X over a

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,360
sample space s this is just a function

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,440
from s to real

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,800
numbers uh we had three different

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,399
formulas at least for expectation in

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,640
different scenarios first one was the

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,879
definition sum overall outcomes Omega

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,239
probability of the outcome times x

16
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,840
evaluated at that outcome sorry this is

17
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,640
a Omega

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,439
uh or we could rewrite that sum

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,400
according to the distinct values of

20
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:12,360
capital x and so sum over the range of X

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,000
and take the probability uh that big x

22
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,680
equals Little X multip by Little X

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,720
that's equivalent um and in the special

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,119
case where X is a function to natural

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,360
numbers then we could write this as an

26
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,600
infinite series sum of I equal 1 to

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,600
Infinity probability of X greater than

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,640
or equal to I and that turned out to be

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,360
equivalent to this thing by expanding it

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,560
out so if the CDF is nice that's a nice

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,960
formula if it's in the special case z

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,799
over natural numbers for independent for

33
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,159
uh indicator random variables where X is

34
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,960
zero or one another special case then

35
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,560
the expectation is just equal to the

36
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,040
probability uh equaling one which is

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,719
like probability of the event that this

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,680
is an indicator for and the big thing

39
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:58,960
was linearity of expectation which told

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,119
us if we summed and also multiplied by a

41
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,119
constant uh inside the expectation we

42
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,399
could push the expectation inside and or

43
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,319
pull the sum and the multiplication out

44
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,560
so this we're going to use all of these

45
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,879
things today uh and see how they

46
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,840
contrast with other other fun properties

47
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,560
um but I'm going to start out with some

48
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,840
motivating examples to give us some

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,400
interesting uh problems to think about

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,920
uh so let's talk

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,920
about a bunch of events

52
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,040
uh

53
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,840
E1 up to e

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,519
n so these are subsets of our sample

55
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,920
space and we can think of those events

56
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,239
being uh a good things or bad things uh

57
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,760
maybe uh these are different ways in

58
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,760
which your computer could fail or your

59
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,640
algorithm could fail or maybe they're

60
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,319
good things maybe these are uh you'd

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,680
like at least one of these to happen or

62
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,840
you'd like at least half of them to

63
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,799
happen happen or whatever uh so we're

64
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,159
going to think about um in

65
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,519
particular the number of events that

66
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:18,519
happen so let's Define a rener variable

67
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:18,519
n to be uh the number of EI

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,239
events that

69
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,439
happen and uh first problem is what is

70
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,000
the expected value of n so what is the

71
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:37,680
expected

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,680
number of events in

73
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,360
general there's a nice formula for this

74
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,840
which is sum I = 1 to n of the

75
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,680
probability of event

76
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,519
I okay this is pretty much a warmup it's

77
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,159
very similar to things that we did last

78
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:00,159
time in fact we did a special case of

79
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,680
this last time uh but let me remind you

80
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,439
those techniques and let's actually do

81
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,640
it for this example so um remember the

82
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,840
technique was if I have some random

83
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,439
variable that is tricky to analyze and I

84
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,200
want to compute this

85
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,479
expectation uh write split it up into a

86
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,519
sum of different random variables so

87
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:21,160
here there's a pretty obvious way to

88
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,320
split it up n is supposed to count the

89
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,080
number of Eis and so each of these uh

90
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,960
suggests we should count them

91
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,600
individually let's define an indicator

92
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,360
random variable I

93
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,360
subi uh for each

94
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,000
event uh and that that is counting among

95
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:45,479
all the events that are known as EI

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,080
there's only one of them how many of

97
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,320
them occurred zero or what did it occur

98
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:58,320
or not so then n is going to be just the

99
00:04:51,320 --> 00:05:00,840
sum uh IAL 1 to n of I I I I captain

100
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,520
then uh we can compute the expectation

101
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,000
using all these fun things so we've got

102
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,639
the expected value of

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
n is uh by linearity the sum of the

104
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:13,000
expected values of the

105
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,759
IIs uh and the if because the IIs are

106
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,560
indicator random variables their

107
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,319
expectation is exactly the probability

108
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:28,160
that they're equal to one so this is sum

109
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:32,120
IAL 1 to n uh probability sorry I keep

110
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,440
forgetting my x's in next to my e uh I I

111
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,400
equals

112
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:42,280
1 uh and that's just by definition of

113
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,280
the IIs that is the probability of

114
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:50,319
EI okay so very easy proof just but

115
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,720
refreshing how we use all these fun

116
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,680
facts we did a special case of this last

117
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,400
time which was if all uh we were

118
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,400
counting if I flip a coin n times and a

119
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,720
prob probability of heads is

120
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,720
p uh so this is biased

121
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,280
coins uh heads probability

122
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:23,520
P then the expected number of

123
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,520
heads uh was equal to P *

124
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,199
n that's something we computed last time

125
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,080
in exactly the same way so this isn't

126
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,919
terribly new but this is more general

127
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,880
form each the events here all the events

128
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,919
were the same probability now they could

129
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:42,039
have different probabilities still you

130
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:45,160
sum them uh cool we'll use this again as

131
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,919
well all right so that's simple warm-up

132
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,560
problem just counting the number of

133
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,840
events now we'd like to understand a

134
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,800
little deeper how many events are going

135
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:59,840
to occur in particular a really

136
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,319
interesting uh question is when does at

137
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,759
least one event occur so if you think of

138
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,560
these for example as being different

139
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,000
failure modes for your system you want

140
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,560
to know what's the chance of anything

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,960
failing out of all the different ways

142
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,400
that things could fail and those events

143
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,360
may not be independent so uh all of this

144
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,280
works even if the Eis are dependent on

145
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,720
each other maybe they're all the same

146
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,319
who knows but uh this summation is

147
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,240
exactly the right answer for expectation

148
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,759
by

149
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,680
linearity uh so let's start with with a

150
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,759
very

151
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,919
simple upper

152
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,800
bound called the union

153
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,720
bound on the chance of something

154
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,720
happening so this is

155
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,520
probability of the

156
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,199
Union hence the name Union bound is at

157
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,159
most the

158
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,120
sum of the

159
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:56,199
probabilities of the

160
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,560
events okay in other words using the

161
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,120
terminology from over here the

162
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,960
probability that at least one event

163
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,479
occurs that's the probability that n is

164
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,520
at least one is at most the expectation

165
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,800
of the number of events because these

166
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,800
two things are equal by this previous

167
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,919
theorem

168
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,199
here so uh these two statements are

169
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,039
equivalent because the number being at

170
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,759
least one that's the same as well that's

171
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,840
at least one event occurring that's the

172
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:29,240
same as the union of these

173
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:31,800
events Okay cool so this is like uh like

174
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,360
the some rule but some rule had an

175
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,560
equality and was only um when the events

176
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,719
were disjoint this works all the time

177
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,000
but it can give a very weak upper bound

178
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,480
depending on your events this sum may be

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,200
larger than one so that doesn't tell you

180
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,360
very very much to say probability is

181
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,040
less than equal to one it's like yeah I

182
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,000
knew that uh you didn't have to do any

183
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:58,880
work let me um in parallel write some

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,880
examples here uh so let's do

185
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,480
our same example of n

186
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,480
independent coin

187
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:18,519
flips uh probability of heads is

188
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:22,000
p

189
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:22,000
then the union

190
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:29,839
bound says that uh the probability of at

191
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:33,160
least one head

192
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,800
is at most P * n right that's this

193
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,440
expectation that I just wrote down over

194
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,680
here P * n was the expected value for

195
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,279
the number of heads so in particular the

196
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,120
probability is at least one head is at

197
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:47,000
most P * n so as soon as p is bigger

198
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,519
than one over n this is not a useful

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,120
upper bound right the the true

200
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:56,440
answer

201
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,720
actual uh

202
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,680
probability there's at least one head

203
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:07,640
this

204
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:09,279
is uh 1 - 1 - P to the N easier to

205
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,160
compute the chance the probability that

206
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,279
there are zero heads that's the same as

207
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,480
saying that there are N Tails so uh this

208
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,760
is the probability of a tals one minus P

209
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,560
raise it to the nth power we get the

210
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,480
probability of Nils we take one minus it

211
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,240
we get the probability that there're not

212
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,800
Nils and other words there at least one

213
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:33,440
head so these are close for very small P

214
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:36,440
but not so great for uh uh even for

215
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,320
small P maybe not so great I don't

216
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,440
know all right um so this is an example

217
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,519
where Union bounds not so

218
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,639
helpful um maybe I'll

219
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,959
do I'll come to other examples in a

220
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,600
moment let me tell you uh a nice

221
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:55,320
property on the other

222
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,880
side uh which I'll call Murphy's Law

223
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,079
it's not the official name

224
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,680
but probably heard of some form of

225
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,000
Murphy's Law in the past uh whatever can

226
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,360
go wrong will go wrong this is a

227
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,639
formalization of that so

228
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,320
if uh the N events we have are mutually

229
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:18,480
independent this is the first time I'm

230
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,480
making this assumption other than that

231
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,040
example uh

232
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,600
then probability of the

233
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,959
Union is at

234
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,519
least uh 1

235
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:46,040
minus 1

236
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:49,399
over e to the sum of the

237
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,399
probabilities of the

238
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:58,360
events okay this

239
00:11:53,959 --> 00:12:01,720
is without any uh n terminology but

240
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,760
maybe a nicer way way is to write it uh

241
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,200
in terms of n probability that at least

242
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:13,240
one event

243
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:16,160
occurs is at least 1 - 1 over e to the

244
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,160
expectation of

245
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,480
n Again

246
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,440
by this theorem relating the expectation

247
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,519
of n to the sum of the it is just a sum

248
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,680
of those

249
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,480
probabilities so um the union bound

250
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,120
gives an upper bound we want to the

251
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,600
chance of some event occurring like some

252
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,839
failure happening uh this tells us it's

253
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,600
at most something and this tells us it's

254
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,040
at least something but this theorem

255
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,279
assumes Mutual Independence so doesn't

256
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:49,560
always apply but in this example it does

257
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,560
apply so we can apply Murphy's Law

258
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:57,480
here and it gives us the probability of

259
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,160
at least one

260
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,480
head is

261
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,480
wrong

262
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:15,480
page at least one minus one/ E to the

263
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:18,320
PN right again the expectation is PN so

264
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,519
1 minus 1 over e to the PN so uh the

265
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,720
bounds tell us it's somewhere between

266
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,399
this uh thing that's kind of close to

267
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,120
one especially if this exponent is large

268
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:33,959
so this is the point is here this

269
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,880
uh denominator increases exponentially

270
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,839
with

271
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:42,639
expectation so

272
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:47,399
uh that means this is going to be very

273
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,079
small if if expectation of n is large um

274
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,680
and so that means this is very close to

275
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:54,639
one right so when the expectation is

276
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,639
large the union bound doesn't tell us

277
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,759
anything useful says it's at most one or

278
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,720
whatever but also Murphy's law says it's

279
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:03,040
actually pretty close to one so maybe

280
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,800
the union bound wasn't so bad after all

281
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,959
that's the idea um I mean in particular

282
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,040
we also know that it's less than equal

283
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:13,279
to one so those two facts combined are

284
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:16,959
maybe okay when the expectation is large

285
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,279
so uh what can go wrong will go wrong

286
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,720
with high probability assuming Mutual

287
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,040
Independence and assuming expectation is

288
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,279
large I guess that's the formal version

289
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:32,519
of Murphy's

290
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:32,519
Law okay uh cool let's do to a

291
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:40,600
particular example of this that I think

292
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:44,600
is instructive which is suppose that

293
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,320
um each event occurs with probability 1

294
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,240
n so this is same thing but I'm just

295
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:55,240
plugging in P 1 n then with the Union

296
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:57,519
bound I get uh the probability of the

297
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:02,360
Union I'll write it one more

298
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:05,560
time is at most one exactly so it's

299
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:09,199
useless um Murphy's

300
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:15,680
Law tells me the probability is at

301
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:19,680
least uh 1 minus 1/ E to the

302
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,720
one which is

303
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,079
about

304
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,680
63 so they're they're pretty close

305
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,279
they're within a factor of two of each

306
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,920
other uh one and 63

307
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,440
and the right

308
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,160
answer

309
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,839
uh well I guess is this thing 1 minus

310
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,839
one/ n to the N I'm not sure it has a

311
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,399
nice nice formula it depends on N which

312
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,399
one is more correct but they're both

313
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,440
they're pretty close so they're both

314
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,360
pretty

315
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:50,480
correct uh here

316
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,800
is maybe another

317
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,920
example so we did two examples at the

318
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,399
end of last class with

319
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,399
randomized uh phone returning

320
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:07,199
at some terrible school where you get

321
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,720
where you get a randomly selected phone

322
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:14,480
when you go home um and then we talked

323
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,519
about a version with a turntable or Lazy

324
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,639
Susan

325
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:21,240
uh where either everyone gets their

326
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,920
phone back or no one does and it was

327
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,399
kind of weird because in expectation

328
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,920
these were the same the expected number

329
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,720
of phones that went back to the correct

330
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,199
person was one independent of how many

331
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,800
people in phones there were as long as

332
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,399
number of phones equals number of people

333
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,600
which is kind of funny expectation was

334
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,079
always

335
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,680
one um

336
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:46,040
so

337
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,399
uh yeah this is an example if you recall

338
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,959
we wrote down uh there was an indicator

339
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,639
random variable I forget what we called

340
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,880
it let's say I sub I uh which was does

341
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,319
the I person get back their phone and we

342
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,800
computed the probability of that

343
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:03,240
equaling one

344
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:06,959
here and here and in both cases it was 1

345
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,120
n so these are actually both examples of

346
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,439
this

347
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:16,919
picture okay I should say uh if mutually

348
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,919
independent I wanted

349
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,839
to in this example I didn't want to

350
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,000
assume Mutual Independence this holds in

351
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,880
all cases this holds if the events are

352
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,039
mutually

353
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,199
independent uh because here the events

354
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:30,679
are not necessarily mutually independent

355
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,720
right in fact they're not in both of

356
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,080
these examples they're different levels

357
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,039
of Independence I would

358
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,360
say but it's they both satis they're

359
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,080
both special cases of this property the

360
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,640
probability of each event is exactly one

361
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,799
over n the probability each person gets

362
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,240
their phone back is one over n both with

363
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:50,679
random permutation of the phones and

364
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,720
with random rotation of the

365
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:55,320
phones um and here I will give you the

366
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,840
actual answers the

367
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,000
probability

368
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,880
uh that any phone is returned

369
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
correctly that's this probability of the

370
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,000
Union of the different uh

371
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,720
events uh in this

372
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,080
case uh well it's easier to compute the

373
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,440
probability that no one gets it

374
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,200
correctly this is like the uh no

375
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,280
repeated serial numbers in the dollar

376
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,320
bill kind of um there so for the first

377
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,080
person they n minus one choices out of n

378
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,679
where they get the wrong phone back and

379
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,200
then the second person there's nus 2

380
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:38,039
choices out of nus1 for them to not get

381
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,039
their correct phone back and so

382
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,080
on and get my cancellation

383
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,919
shock uh n minus one's cancel nus 2's

384
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,720
cancel nus 3's cancel and so on we're

385
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:59,159
left with 1 - 1

386
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,840
n okay which is in between these two

387
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:04,280
values so that's

388
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,080
good uh and it's actually very close to

389
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,400
the union

390
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:13,159
bound uh closer to the union bound than

391
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:15,840
the other one so I would say yeah um I

392
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:20,120
don't know these are uh pretty

393
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,120
independent is my fancy

394
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,159
analysis uh yeah maybe they're

395
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,200
independent if you look at it the right

396
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,559
way it depends how you define the

397
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,840
problem exactly

398
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,840
um over

399
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,880
here what's the probability that any

400
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,720
phone gets returned correctly this is

401
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,960
actually a really easy one I rotate the

402
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,600
phones on a

403
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:50,440
table what's the chance that anyone gets

404
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,440
their phone back

405
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,840
correctly yeah one over n there just n

406
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,600
possible outcomes here and one of them

407
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,120
everyone gets their phone back so

408
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,960
capital N equals little n and in the

409
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,080
other situation zero people get their

410
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,039
fund

411
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,720
back so this seems to

412
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:14,919
violate uh this lower bound right we

413
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,840
said it should be at least 63 so uh in

414
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:18,200
order to do that it means that they're

415
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,600
very

416
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,080
dependent I mean it's it's very hard for

417
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,760
events to be more dependent than them

418
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,480
being equal in fact the first person

419
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,799
gets their fund back if and only if the

420
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,320
second person gets their fund back if

421
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,080
and only if the third person gets their

422
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:36,320
Fone back uh so indeed the events are

423
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:40,960
equal to each other here the same single

424
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:43,159
outcome and so that's why this is

425
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:48,799
breaking

426
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:52,320
okay uh I wanted to prove Murphy's Law

427
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,320
and then we'll come back to one more

428
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,799
example uh where we at over here

429
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,720
like where does this exponential come

430
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,880
from it's an

431
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,600
approximation so uh it comes from one of

432
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,600
these

433
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,799
fun uh facts that we've used before so

434
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,559
just like in this last

435
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,679
example um instead of computing the

436
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,960
probability that at least one things

437
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:22,880
happens let's compute the probability

438
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,880
that zero of the events happen and then

439
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:29,520
do one minus it okay so I'm going to

440
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:31,360
compute uh the probability

441
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,080
complement of this event is that n

442
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,520
equals zero so no events

443
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,400
occur okay in other words the

444
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:45,039
probability uh that E1 does not occur

445
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:47,200
and E2 does not occur and uh e n does

446
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,200
not

447
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,720
occur

448
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,720
okay

449
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,880
uh well um the E are independent are

450
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,679
mutually independent and one of the

451
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,600
things we we mentioned uh and may be

452
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,640
proved in recitation I forget back when

453
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,440
we were doing the independence lecture

454
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,360
is that if uh events are independent

455
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,039
then also their complements are

456
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,279
independent if E1 and E2 are independent

457
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,720
from each other then E1 complement is

458
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:21,000
independent from E2

459
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:24,440
complement uh and so

460
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,279
um we from the product rule this

461
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,360
probability of intersections for inde

462
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,559
and mutually independent events events

463
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,559
is just the product of the

464
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,799
probabilities

465
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:48,039
okay uh what else so this probability is

466
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:50,880
of course one minus the probability of

467
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:55,360
EI and now we're going to use this fun

468
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:59,679
fact uh which is this is at most e to

469
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:03,720
the minus probability of EI

470
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:08,880
by this uh fact that 1 - x is less than

471
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:11,720
or equal to eus x uh for x non-

472
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,400
negative we've used this few lectures

473
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,080
ago I think uh this was the Taylor

474
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,880
series expansion of e to Theus X you

475
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,919
take the first two terms it's a very

476
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,679
good approximation when X is small which

477
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,799
is kind of an interesting case we're

478
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,200
thinking of these probabilities

479
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,159
individually as being small but there

480
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,240
might be lots of events then this will

481
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,159
be a good approximation uh but it's

482
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,279
always true that it's at less than or

483
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:38,440
equal to in all cases so this is fine um

484
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,600
and so now we have a product of

485
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,279
exponentials and by properties of

486
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,240
exponentials we can pull the exponential

487
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:48,200
out and sorry this is less than or equal

488
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:54,320
to e uh to this sum

489
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:56,520
minus uh sum I = 1 to n of probability

490
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,520
of

491
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,880
EI okay which if you stare at it long

492
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,679
enough that's exactly what we got here e

493
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,760
to the minus is the same as one over e

494
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,200
to the thing this sum and because we are

495
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,440
Computing the complement event we have

496
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,279
to do a one minus at front and instead

497
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,679
of an upper bound this was an upper

498
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,279
bound on the failure uh this is a lower

499
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,720
bound on success if success is one of

500
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,720
the events

501
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,399
occurring Okay

502
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,799
cool so that's where the exponentials

503
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:31,120
come from it's a way to product of one

504
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,840
minus something is ugly there's no nice

505
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,559
way to simplify that but if we use this

506
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:39,399
approximation then we get a product of

507
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:41,559
exponentials and life is good so um for

508
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:44,200
fun you know as we're winding down the

509
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:48,039
class uh I think it's time to enjoy

510
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,399
music video so uh the application is

511
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:52,120
we're going to think

512
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:54,640
about uh we have some probabilities of

513
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,080
failures and here this is a really cool

514
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,039
rubbe Goldberg machine made by the rock

515
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:04,000
band okay go

516
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:05,279
uh and there are about over a hundred

517
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,919
different components in this rub

518
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,559
Goldberg machine so the the Challen what

519
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,080
you want to think about is what's the

520
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:14,640
probability of at least one of those

521
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,710
components failing in a single uncut

555
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,519
Go's music videos I highly recommend

556
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,080
instead of studying for the final you

557
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:15,159
should watch them uh amazing stuff I

558
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,320
actually I've watched this video like 10

559
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:18,919
times in the last day and I only just

560
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,919
now realized how many references there

561
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:22,679
are to other okaygo music videos so if

562
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:24,679
you watch them all you'll get extra

563
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:29,000
appreciation then watch this one again

564
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:30,720
and you'll see them all um cool so I I

565
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,080
happen to be friends uh in particular

566
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,399
with Damien who's the the lead singer

567
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,559
and I was chatting with him like

568
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:41,000
how how how did you make this work

569
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,440
because uh he's in many talks that he

570
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,039
gives like he has a TED talk it's linked

571
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,200
in the lecture notes he said okay uh

572
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:49,200
there about 130

573
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:58,240
components in the

574
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,480
setup uh so if you imagine each uh fails

575
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,000
uh

576
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:05,760
with probability say

577
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,440
10% reasonable if you engineer something

578
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,399
well should work like 90% of the time I

579
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,279
don't know if you ever built a rub

580
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,200
Goldberg machine even that's difficult

581
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:17,000
to engineer it's very easy to get more

582
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:20,600
like 50 70% success rate uh but let's

583
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,640
say you can get 90% success rate then uh

584
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:29,440
what's the probability that uh there is

585
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:32,360
a failure number of fails is at least

586
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,039
one well you know it's the same thing we

587
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:38,399
had before uh one

588
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,399
minus 1 - 1 minus P to the N this is the

589
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,240
actual we won't use any approximation

590
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,240
here uh it turns out to

591
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,159
be uh

592
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,840
99.999

593
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,639
89% which is exactly one in a million

594
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,799
chance that this video will come out

595
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:01,679
good

596
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,960
so uh that's

597
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,559
terrible uh and then you know and his

598
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,000
talks he goes on it's like yeah so you

599
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:10,159
know we've really go to um we got to

600
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,200
take chances and you know uh just

601
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,360
explore and not be um not worry about

602
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,919
failing it's the main point of his talk

603
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,240
but then he never explains like well how

604
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:19,799
did you make the video if there's a one

605
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,360
in a million chance that it comes out

606
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:24,480
right did you do a million

607
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,600
takes uh and I don't know how many takes

608
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,559
uh they did he didn't just didn't

609
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,760
remember uh

610
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,440
but he said the the secret for it

611
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,679
working was to do the math after you've

612
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,000
made the video instead of

613
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,480
before uh maybe a little unsatisfying uh

614
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,799
but on reflection um I mean you could

615
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,960
work out some other probabilities right

616
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,600
if you say okay there's only uh 1% of uh

617
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,799
chance of

618
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,159
failure then the probability the whole

619
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:56,120
thing succeeds is uh or the probability

620
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:59,600
of failure overall is

621
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:02,039
73% still not very good but doable like

622
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,159
you could do four takes and then one of

623
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:08,600
them will be good in expectation uh but

624
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:12,440
99% reliability is challenging it's only

625
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:15,320
when you get to like if if you get to

626
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,320
99.9% success rate then this starts to

627
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,480
get impressive you only a 12% chance

628
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,639
that something fails um but apparently

629
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,919
the in hindsight what worked well for

630
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:28,440
this video is because the the effects

631
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,519
the interactions get big and bigger

632
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,760
towards the end of the video because

633
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,639
they just wanted to make them more and

634
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,159
more impressive with bowling balls and

635
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:36,320
giant things and you know huge

636
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,600
interactions huge interactions actually

637
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,919
fail less often because something like a

638
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,880
bowling ball is less affected by air

639
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:44,799
currents in the room and stuff like that

640
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,240
so the bowling balls were super reliable

641
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,960
they were probably down here in the very

642
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,159
very like maybe several nines uh

643
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,159
Effectiveness whereas some of the very

644
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,760
early effects in particular The Dominoes

645
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,840
which open the video I'll just play that

646
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:02,320
again because I love watching this video

647
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:06,600
um they failed almost every single time

648
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:09,120
so um this this very first move

649
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:12,000
apparently dominoes are extremely

650
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,799
unpredictable so doing this in a way

651
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,279
they said they set up the dominoes

652
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,279
roughly six billion times I think that's

653
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:21,480
an exaggeration but uh that's I guess

654
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:23,360
the other answer is to do uh six billion

655
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,440
uh takes and then you'll be set and they

656
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,480
got one take with everything in it which

657
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,960
is pretty pretty amazing despite the

658
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,200
odds

659
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,120
all right so that was just a fun

660
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,120
diversion but I love an opportunity to

661
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,720
talk about rub Goldberg machines and

662
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,919
stare at

663
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,880
them all right uh let's do some more fun

664
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,279
things

665
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,279
about uh

666
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:49,679
expectation

667
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:57,279
products so it turns out there's a

668
00:33:54,639 --> 00:34:00,399
product rule just like for probability

669
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,480
but for expectation it relies on the

670
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,480
random variables being

671
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:15,079
independent and then it's exactly what

672
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:20,079
you expect the expectation of the

673
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:23,440
product is equal to product of the

674
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,599
expectations so similar to probability

675
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,639
in fact this is really just a

676
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,240
generalized version of the product rule

677
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,000
for probability

678
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:36,720
maybe I'll give like a quick sketch of

679
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:41,839
the proof how's my time yeah let's do it

680
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:44,639
uh so this expectation of X product y if

681
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,639
I just write out the

682
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,400
definition uh we just take all the

683
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:01,440
possible outcomes we don't know anything

684
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,320
about them but x * Y is a function we

685
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,400
evaluated it at that outcome this is the

686
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:08,040
same thing as taking X of the outcome

687
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,040
and multiplying by y of the outcome

688
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,359
that's the definition of this product

689
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,960
function uh and then we multiply yeah we

690
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:16,960
multiply by the probability outcome sum

691
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:18,960
them up that's the deal uh just like

692
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,079
with this

693
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:26,160
formula we can rearrange the terms in

694
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:28,440
that sum to where here it was by x value

695
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:33,079
but we could do it by X and y value so

696
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:35,839
we can rewrite this as a sum over uh X

697
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:40,640
and a sum over y other words a sum over

698
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:44,320
pairs X comma y uh of this

699
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,680
thing uh but now so there are a bunch of

700
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,200
probabilities of outcomes that have the

701
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,359
same X and Y so we're just going to

702
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,200
write the probability that x equals

703
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:58,480
Little X and Big Y equals little Y and

704
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,480
multiply that by x * y

705
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,720
okay that's rearranging uh terms with

706
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,720
the same X time X and Y value like we

707
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:11,680
did uh last class and then this

708
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,960
probability is a product right by the

709
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,880
product rule for for probabilities X and

710
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,160
Y are independent means that these two

711
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,760
events are independent for all X and Y

712
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:25,240
and so uh we can rewrite this as

713
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,920
probability of X equaling little x times

714
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:32,960
probability of Y equaling little

715
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:36,240
Y and now we have a s a double sum over

716
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,800
some things involving X and some things

717
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,000
involving y sorry for the pun I didn't

718
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,000
mean to say some all the time there uh

719
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,760
things involving X and things involving

720
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,760
Y and we know from way back in our

721
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,760
summation formulas we can separate out

722
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,280
the summation over X from the summation

723
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,040
over y take their product and if you do

724
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:58,480
that you get exactly uh this formula

725
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,319
with X and with y

726
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,640
and so I didn't write it here but this

727
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:05,440
is x in the range of X this is y in the

728
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,440
range of Y and so that's uh that's why

729
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,240
this works so it's really just using

730
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,240
product rule for

731
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,440
probabilities cool uh let's do an

732
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,440
example with

733
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:27,920
that suppose we've invented a new game

734
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:30,599
which is We Roll two independent

735
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,599
uh six-sided

736
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,280
Dice and then the score is the product

737
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,200
of those two

738
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,520
dice not a typical game usually some but

739
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,680
uh let's say we take the product what is

740
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,400
the expectation of that product well if

741
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,960
they're independent we know it's the

742
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,960
product of the

743
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:58,720
expectations and expectation of a die

744
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:02,760
roll we covered last time it's a

745
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,440
3.5 so this is 3.5

746
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,520
squared which

747
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,520
is

748
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,520
uh

749
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:15,839
12.25 okay weird number there it

750
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,760
is whereas

751
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:39,359
if I take the expectation of D1 * D1

752
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:41,720
also known as D1 squared D1 is not

753
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,640
independent from D1 in fact is the most

754
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,680
dependent it could be they're the same

755
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:50,200
same random variable uh I claim I do not

756
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:52,480
get 12.25 even though each of these

757
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:56,200
individually has an expectation of

758
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,480
3.5 uh let's just compute that or get an

759
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,440
idea how we would compute it think could

760
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,520
just use the the definition we have or

761
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,200
really the summing uh summing over X in

762
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,640
range of X so we have six possible

763
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,560
outcomes for

764
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:17,240
D1 and we want the probability that D1

765
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:20,800
equals Little D times Little

766
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,119
D right that's the the second version of

767
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,119
expect second formula for

768
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,400
expectation uh this is just 1 six for

769
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,280
fair

770
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,200
dice I I didn't mention fair but I

771
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,319
mentioned I meant to say fair dice so

772
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:40,560
this is the Aver uh sorry didn't get

773
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:42,720
this right I'm missing a a product right

774
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,720
this is this thing so sum over the

775
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,839
different die rolls but now we have D

776
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,119
squ

777
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:50,960
here okay and I can never remember the

778
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:54,520
formula for sum of d uh sum of squares

779
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:58,040
but we get 1 16 times that sum of

780
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:00,599
squares you know 1 2 + 2 S Plus

781
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,240
3^2 up to 6^

782
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:06,680
S

783
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,680
which uh turns out to

784
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,680
be 15.1

785
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,880
1666 so

786
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:18,800
bigger kind of weird but there you

787
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:21,480
go all right so this was product rule

788
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,200
for for two random variables of course

789
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,520
if you take the product of n random

790
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,599
variables you can do the same thing uh

791
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,480
if there's product of nxis here you just

792
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:33,839
get a product of n expectations of

793
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:37,240
XIs so when things are independent life

794
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,520
is good what about division we spend all

795
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,520
this time adding and multiplying

796
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:44,200
probabilities and

797
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:48,359
expectations can we divide

798
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:51,359
them uh the short answer is no never

799
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:52,440
divide random variables ever I'll show

800
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:55,200
you

801
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:58,800
why uh

802
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:03,160
don't divide

803
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,640
okay one reason is um expectation of 1

804
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,480
/x this is sort of if if we could do

805
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:10,000
this we could multi we could multiply it

806
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:13,760
with something and end up dividing uh

807
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,359
does not equal one over expectation of x

808
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,359
uh in general or probably

809
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,680
usually and here's one example uh where

810
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,760
this

811
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,119
is uh

812
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:30,040
particularly striking they're very

813
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:32,640
different um uh suppose you have X this

814
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,800
is almost a uh an indicator random

815
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,000
variable but it's going to be instead of

816
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,079
one or zero it's going to be one or

817
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,960
minus one so let's say it's one with

818
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,440
probability a

819
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,599
half and it's minus one with probability

820
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,599
a

821
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,400
half okay what's the

822
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,680
expectation

823
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,680
zero it's just the average because

824
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:03,079
they're equally

825
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,720
likely uh so one over the

826
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:08,440
expectation is not a very good number

827
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:13,040
it's like infinity or something this is

828
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,480
bad one over zero uh whereas if I take

829
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,839
uh

830
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,839
expectation of 1

831
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:24,880
/x well one over one over one is just

832
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,520
one one over minus one is also minus one

833
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,960
like one over doesn't do anything to X

834
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,960
this expectation of 1/x is expectation

835
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,559
of

836
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,680
X which is zero so this thing is like

837
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,280
infinity or just undefined and this

838
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,200
thing is zero so they're very different

839
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,079
from each

840
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,240
other and in some sense uh you should

841
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:47,160
just never do this this is a reasonable

842
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,520
quantity to think about don't don't

843
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,160
think about this one although that seems

844
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,400
backwards given here given what we

845
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:56,760
showed here um here's here's a more

846
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,079
here's a real world example this is

847
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,800
based on a a paper in computer

848
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,800
architecture where they're trying to

849
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,760
argue that one

850
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,200
architecture I don't know if it was P1

851
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,599
or P2 I think this a little divorced

852
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,960
from the original

853
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:17,119
example um so there were two different

854
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,960
processor architectures for solving

855
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,200
three different possible workloads these

856
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,319
were like benchmarks that they could

857
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:27,119
evaluate them on and uh processor one on

858
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:30,599
workload one took 10 seconds to complete

859
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,760
processor 2 took 16 seconds uh and so on

860
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:36,200
there's a table here you run each of

861
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,520
these processors for each of these

862
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:42,800
workloads and you see what you get let's

863
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:44,559
say these are each uh equally likely 13

864
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,960
probability of

865
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,640
occurring and you want to know which one

866
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,599
is

867
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,960
better and this is one of those things

868
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,240
where you think well either I should

869
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,520
take the expectation of the ratios or I

870
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:59,160
should take the ratio of the

871
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:02,000
expectations um if you let's compute the

872
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:05,800
the expectations individually first so

873
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:11,680
if I add these up I get 30 there's three

874
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:14,839
of them so the uh expectation is 10 and

875
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:18,240
here it's also

876
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:19,720
10 okay so in fact the the ratio of the

877
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,720
expectations which I think is a

878
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:25,040
reasonable thing to do so let's just

879
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,160
call this P1 performance over

880
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,559
expectation of P2 performance

881
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,200
uh is one so in fact these are equally

882
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:35,240
good in

883
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,079
expectation okay this is because if

884
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:40,119
they're equally like the intuition why

885
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:43,000
you should do this is in each if you

886
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:45,599
assume that these workloads are equally

887
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,200
likely then

888
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,720
uh yeah you you should be Computing how

889
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,280
long will your process take given a

890
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,280
randomly chosen workload according to

891
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,160
that distribution okay so you should be

892
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,800
summing all these up before you do any

893
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,800
kind of ratio

894
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:04,160
but what the paper

895
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:06,800
did was take the expectation of the

896
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,760
ratio and with these particular

897
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,359
carefully chosen numbers but they

898
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,839
roughly match those at the paper uh you

899
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,839
get a funny

900
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:23,040
fact which is uh if you take the

901
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:26,160
expectation of P1 over P2 this is a ton

902
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:29,280
of arithmetic so I will not do it uh we

903
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:33,520
get 10

904
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:35,720
over9 so it looks like um these are

905
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,599
running times so smaller is better that

906
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:41,559
looks like P2 is better than

907
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:43,359
P1 but if you take the ra the expected

908
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:46,079
ratio of P2 over

909
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:49,760
P1 it's also 10 over

910
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:53,440
9 so clearly P1 is better than

911
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,079
P2 uh why is this happening because

912
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,119
expectation of ratios is just something

913
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:59,720
you should never do and is meaningless

914
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,079
okay or takeen a different way if you

915
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,079
want to lie with Statistics here is a

916
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:06,440
great way to do it take expectation of

917
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,760
ratios you can make you could support

918
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,240
any story you like uh at least with

919
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,559
these if you're lucky the numbers are

920
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,040
close then uh you get this funny funny

921
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:17,200
Behavior this is what you should do if

922
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,119
you don't want to lie and you want to

923
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,960
compare

924
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:22,359
performance okay don't divide random

925
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,240
variables I think this is all you'll

926
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:28,119
have to do with dividing random

927
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:32,400
variables uh cool but multiplying is

928
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:32,400
good as long as they're mutually

929
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:37,760
independent any

930
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:41,160
questions

931
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:44,559
cool so the last topic for

932
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,559
today is

933
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:51,280
variance so expectation was a way to

934
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:53,760
take a whole function a random variable

935
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,000
and reduce it down to one number now

936
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,520
we're going to talk about how to take a

937
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,760
whole function and reduce it down to two

938
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,599
num

939
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,599
expectation and variance and I'll say a

940
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,079
little bit why these are maybe the first

941
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,720
two numbers you might care about there

942
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:07,040
are more of course you might care about

943
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,400
the whole distribution and in some sense

944
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,960
what we've been doing what we did with

945
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,640
the these guys the union bound of the

946
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,599
Murphy's Law was trying to capture a

947
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,440
little more than just the expectation

948
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:18,400
but just trying to understand how much

949
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,359
is at the zero spot versus everything

950
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,920
else and next class on Tuesday we'll

951
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,680
we'll talk about a generalized form of

952
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,359
that where there's some cut off and we

953
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,920
want to know how much how much

954
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,720
probability is out beyond the cut off

955
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,680
those are called Tales of a distribution

956
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,680
but today we're going to just in the

957
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,800
rest of today we're just going to look

958
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:40,960
at one more number that measures some

959
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:44,880
kind of like well

960
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,680
variance uh it it tries to measure how

961
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,839
good of an approximation is the

962
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,079
expectation that's I think a good way to

963
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:52,440
think about

964
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:56,480
it and I'm sure you've seen variance in

965
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:58,839
some form before but uh maybe motivating

966
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,839
example

967
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,800
is

968
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,599
investment AKA

969
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:17,400
gambling sorry for the Dig uh but uh

970
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:21,359
let's consider an investment process XI

971
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:23,240
which is um plus I with probability a

972
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:27,280
half going to be a generalized version

973
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:31,440
of the one I just did uh and minus I

974
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:34,640
with probability sorry not

975
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:37,240
I2 probability

976
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:41,720
one2 okay

977
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:44,319
uh so like X1 is like I invest $1 and

978
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:47,800
50% chance I double my money 50% chance

979
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:50,520
I lose my money uh x 100 is I put in

980
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,240
$100 and 50% chance I double my money

981
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:55,440
50% chance I lose all my money or I

982
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,559
could put in you know a billion dollars

983
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,760
do are these exactly the same investment

984
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:01,880
strategies I mean you would probably say

985
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,119
with when I is larger this is a higher

986
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,880
risk investment if I put in a billion

987
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:07,240
dollars that's very scary I could

988
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,520
potentially lose a billion dollars of

989
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,960
course I could also win a billion

990
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,400
dollars so that's like high risk High

991
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,680
reward if I invest $1 like yeah I'd play

992
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:20,319
that game why not it's for just for

993
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:23,000
fun okay uh so if we look at the

994
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:25,400
expectation we learn nothing expectation

995
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,359
of all of these is zero just like it was

996
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,599
in the eal one case

997
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:32,480
uh variance is going to try to capture

998
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:36,520
uh something involving

999
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,520
I okay let me Define

1000
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:51,760
variance it's kind of a big formula but

1001
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:54,880
not too big once you stare at it long

1002
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,680
enough so many brackets though

1003
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:01,480
alternating a square and round all right

1004
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:05,839
so uh what we're going to do is

1005
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:09,559
take the deviation from the mean x minus

1006
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:13,000
the expectation of X so this is a random

1007
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:15,319
variable it's it's just like X but we

1008
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,640
subtract the expectation of x and by

1009
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:19,240
linearity of expectation that means this

1010
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:22,520
may be worth writing down the

1011
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:25,480
expectation of x minus the expectation

1012
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:28,000
of this braced quantity

1013
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:31,079
here is is

1014
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,960
zero because uh linearity says well this

1015
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:37,319
is expectation of

1016
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:39,400
x uh minus the expectation of the

1017
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:42,280
expectation of

1018
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,200
X but uh the expectation of the

1019
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:46,040
expectation of X is just the expectation

1020
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,839
of X

1021
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:52,680
because um while X is a random variable

1022
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:55,160
I mean expectation of X is also a random

1023
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:58,000
variable but it's doesn't change right

1024
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:00,440
expectation of X is a single number

1025
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,280
uh you reroll your dice the expectation

1026
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,680
doesn't change only X the the X the

1027
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,760
value of x can change because it's a

1028
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:08,599
function but expectation of X is a

1029
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:12,200
constant thing so its expectation is

1030
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:12,200
itself okay so these

1031
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,240
cancel okay so in other words I'm taking

1032
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,680
X which has some expectation but then

1033
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:21,200
I'm shifting it over so it's uh now its

1034
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:24,680
expectation is zero I'd like to Center

1035
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:26,680
things on zero additively then I'm going

1036
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:29,960
to square it which is maybe a little

1037
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:32,440
weird we'll talk about why in a second

1038
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,720
uh and then I take the expectation of

1039
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,960
that because while this thing is

1040
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,359
constant this thing is not so if your

1041
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,079
expectation happens to be zero this is

1042
00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:42,480
just the expectation of X squ whereas

1043
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:44,920
before we're taking the expectation of X

1044
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:47,000
now we're taking expectation of x s and

1045
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,599
for X squ to be nice we're going to

1046
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,599
first shift it so that its mean is zero

1047
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,359
okay those a lot of words uh in this

1048
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:57,640
example the expectation was already zero

1049
00:51:54,359 --> 00:52:00,319
and so the variance of XI is just the

1050
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:03,559
expectation of x i

1051
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:03,559
s which

1052
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:10,680
is uh get this

1053
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,799
right oh yeah fun thing about square is

1054
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,559
it makes positive and negative numbers

1055
00:52:17,799 --> 00:52:23,640
treats positive and negative numbers the

1056
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:27,960
same so the what is x i

1057
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:30,119
squ it's always i^ squ

1058
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,200
no matter how the coin flip occurred if

1059
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:33,920
it was plus I the square of that is I

1060
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:37,359
squ if it was minus I the square of that

1061
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:40,240
is I squ okay so U this is part of the

1062
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:43,760
magic of variance that we treat negative

1063
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,960
and positive numbers the same and so uh

1064
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,040
the expectation of I squ I I squ doesn't

1065
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,960
depend on anything so it's just I

1066
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:54,359
squ and for this reason we also often

1067
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:58,440
Define uh the square root of variance to

1068
00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:58,440
be the standard deviation

1069
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,920
uh which we usually write Sigma subx

1070
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:09,200
here is going to be square root of the

1071
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,559
variance of X so you can use whichever

1072
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,400
of these you want I mean they're the

1073
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:16,960
same up to a square root or a square uh

1074
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:19,799
but it's a second number Sigma subx I

1075
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:22,520
here is equal to

1076
00:53:19,799 --> 00:53:24,880
I so while expectation told us nothing

1077
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:26,520
about the risk of our investment Sigma

1078
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,960
told us exactly what the risk is and

1079
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:30,720
this very set simple

1080
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,640
setup

1081
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:36,040
okay

1082
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:40,799
let's go on to the next topic which is y

1083
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,799
squared try to give you some intuition

1084
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:09,880
okay uh y^

1085
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:20,599
2 there are many possible answers to

1086
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:23,280
this

1087
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:25,480
uh but probably the simplest thing is to

1088
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,040
try what if I didn't put this Square

1089
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,240
here and I left the formula otherwise

1090
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:33,799
the same what if I did

1091
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:36,240
expectation of xus expectation of X what

1092
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:36,240
would happen

1093
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:51,200
then yeah zero I wrote it right here

1094
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:53,280
expectation I I saying oh this shifted

1095
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,079
things over so the expectation was zero

1096
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,400
so if you remove the square you just are

1097
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:59,480
going to get zero this would be a

1098
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,400
useless number right so we want to put

1099
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,599
something

1100
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:06,559
here one one possible answer now uh

1101
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:10,799
there different things you might try to

1102
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:15,599
do um one would be uh

1103
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:19,319
expectation of x minus expectation of

1104
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:23,400
x to the P for

1105
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:24,079
some uh number P what we did just did

1106
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,319
was

1107
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:29,760
two another thing you might try to do to

1108
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,760
to fix it is absolute

1109
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,760
value and just for fun we could also

1110
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:40,039
raise that to the PE

1111
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:42,400
power and uh so these are natural things

1112
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:44,680
to try I would argue especially if you

1113
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,440
know anything about Norms or you know

1114
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:51,559
geometry and stuff um and it turns out

1115
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,559
all of these are interesting

1116
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:58,440
question yeah

1117
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:01,599
i s or are you setting the expectation

1118
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:04,640
of ah I uh I wasn't setting anything I

1119
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:07,240
was claiming that x i squ as a random

1120
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:10,559
variable is always I

1121
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:12,280
squ because x i is either plus I or

1122
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:15,200
minus I and in both cases the square of

1123
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:17,640
that is i s so this is inside the

1124
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:20,000
expectation yeah and therefore the

1125
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:23,359
expectation doesn't have anything to

1126
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,480
do it's a constant not a not much of a

1127
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:26,960
random

1128
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,799
variable okay back to these guys uh

1129
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:34,960
these have names this is uh for p

1130
00:56:29,799 --> 00:56:37,960
greater than one this is uh the PE uh

1131
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,960
Central

1132
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:44,039
moment uh and this one for p greater

1133
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:47,359
than equal to one is the

1134
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:50,119
pee uh probably Central this one's not

1135
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:54,359
talked about nearly as much uh but I

1136
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:54,359
would call it the absolute moment

1137
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:06,599
and they're all interesting uh for this

1138
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,720
one p equals 2 is called variance that's

1139
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:11,200
the one we're talking about uh P equals

1140
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:14,119
3 with some normalization which I'm not

1141
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:17,119
going to do here it's called the skew of

1142
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:18,720
the distribution P equal 4 is something

1143
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:22,760
it's got a really fancy name just

1144
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:25,440
showing off my my English knowledge is

1145
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,880
called curtosis uh I assume people

1146
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,359
looked at other

1147
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,760
uh moments too although usually they

1148
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:31,960
just called you know first moment second

1149
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,720
moment third moment whatever these are

1150
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,960
all very interesting quantities they

1151
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,720
capture different things about the

1152
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,280
distribution variance is how far from

1153
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:41,240
the mean are you on average in some

1154
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,480
sense skew is sort of how to the left or

1155
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:46,280
to the right is your distribution

1156
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,599
cryosis I have no idea I'm not a uh St

1157
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,359
statistician but they all have some

1158
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,520
meaning and you can do the same thing

1159
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:53,720
with absolute moment you can also do it

1160
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,400
without this uh normalization term then

1161
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:58,920
you remove the word central uh these are

1162
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,599
interesting cool quantities so there's

1163
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:03,119
no particular reason two is special and

1164
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,559
in fact if you do absolute values you

1165
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:07,000
can even go down to one and you get a

1166
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:10,240
reasonably interesting thing um but

1167
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,720
often we really like uh the version

1168
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,319
without absolute value because it's

1169
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,559
smooth because it's infinitely

1170
00:58:13,319 --> 00:58:17,359
differentiable whereas absolute value is

1171
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:19,760
not differentiable so it's just uglier

1172
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:21,640
to work with analytically so

1173
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,760
historically this is why we go here I

1174
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,000
think this is also a very interesting

1175
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:28,119
measure and you could use it just we're

1176
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,119
not going to use it in this class

1177
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:32,440
okay they give you

1178
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:35,000
different they give you different things

1179
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,680
because this square is exaggerating

1180
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,160
larger differences right if you square

1181
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,480
something that's big it has a bigger

1182
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,400
impact than if you square something

1183
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:45,359
that's

1184
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:47,520
small so if you care about deviation

1185
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:49,319
from the mean and you really you care a

1186
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,039
little more about big deviations than

1187
00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:53,280
small deviations then raising this to

1188
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:56,359
some power is a meaningful thing and

1189
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,680
that's that's why we do it

1190
00:58:56,359 --> 00:59:01,720
uh there are some other reasons um if in

1191
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,359
in the stat statistics world if you know

1192
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,319
that X is normally distributed which

1193
00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:09,440
actually is kind of common Even in our

1194
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:11,960
world if you take a sum of a bunch of uh

1195
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:15,799
bruli trials this is

1196
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:17,559
um uh has some name right not the bruli

1197
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:19,839
distribution so like brui trials are

1198
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:23,720
coin flips you take a sum of them you

1199
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:26,880
get uh a binomial distribution I should

1200
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:28,319
know that uh then uh there's something

1201
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,480
called a central limit theorem that says

1202
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,000
that's very close to a normal

1203
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:34,240
distribution normal distribution is you

1204
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,839
know gaussian bell curve uh and it turns

1205
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,880
out if you know the expectation and the

1206
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:39,319
variance of your distribution and it's

1207
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,839
normal then you know everything about

1208
00:59:39,319 --> 00:59:42,880
that distribution so because Normal

1209
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:46,160
distributions are frequently occurring

1210
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,760
in nature both in real life and in

1211
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,400
mathematical life uh like when we sum a

1212
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:53,400
bunch of uh coin

1213
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,720
flips uh these this expectation variant

1214
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,280
are often the first two things you

1215
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,720
should care about maybe they're the only

1216
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,160
things you need to know if you want to

1217
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,160
understand your

1218
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:04,200
distribution and then because I'm a

1219
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:07,480
geometer I have to say because we live

1220
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:12,839
in a because we're living in a ukian

1221
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:14,079
world you know in ukian world uh you you

1222
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:16,079
square things and then you take the

1223
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,559
square root at the end right this is

1224
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:22,000
this is the norm this is actually the

1225
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:23,720
distance between two points in uh size

1226
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,720
of s

1227
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:28,799
Dimensions okay I'm a I'm I'm usually a

1228
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,920
two-dimensional geometer maybe three

1229
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,920
dimensions but if you're crazy you can

1230
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,119
live all the way up in size of s

1231
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,680
Dimensions where you can represent you

1232
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:40,480
can represent a function as just like a

1233
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:42,760
big Vector very popular these days um uh

1234
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:46,160
just you write down all the possible for

1235
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:49,880
every outcome you write what x is that's

1236
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:52,160
a vector in s dimensions and if you also

1237
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,839
write down for every possible outcome

1238
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,640
what expected value of x is uh it's the

1239
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:58,839
same every time it's mean mean mean mean

1240
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:01,319
mean mean mean very

1241
01:00:58,839 --> 01:01:03,240
mean then and you take the distance

1242
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:05,839
between those two vectors that's exactly

1243
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:09,000
variance or sorry standard

1244
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:10,480
deviation so if you live in ukian world

1245
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,280
that's why two is natural of course you

1246
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,480
can live in any P norm and then you get

1247
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,559
all these other

1248
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:17,400
things all right let me tell you some

1249
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:22,000
cool properties of

1250
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:22,000
invariance uh here

1251
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,520
some of these I'll prove some of these

1252
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:34,200
I'll just State and you'll prove them in

1253
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:38,200
recitation tomorrow but we'll see some

1254
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:38,200
we'll use them to analyze some

1255
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:51,599
examples okay so our first one is

1256
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:51,599
translation and variance

1257
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:04,000
so what I'd like to do is

1258
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:07,240
um take some random variable X and add a

1259
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,480
constant to it now when I add a constant

1260
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:12,520
to X I change the

1261
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:14,920
expectation right it also shifts over by

1262
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:17,880
linearity with variance it actually

1263
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:20,920
doesn't change the variance of X plus C

1264
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:24,119
equals the variance of X that's a nice

1265
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:26,079
property probably true of all of all of

1266
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:27,839
these definitions

1267
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:28,880
all of the moments but we'll just do it

1268
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,240
for

1269
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:35,359
variance

1270
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:37,319
uh so let's prove it so as I said the

1271
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:39,839
expectation we need that in order to

1272
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:41,799
compute variance expectation is always

1273
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:45,359
what you should do first by linearity

1274
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:47,680
this is expectation of X Plus

1275
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:48,720
expectation of C but expectation of C is

1276
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:52,279
just

1277
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:54,160
C because it doesn't change depending on

1278
01:02:52,279 --> 01:02:57,839
the random

1279
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,839
event so

1280
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:04,240
variance of X plus

1281
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:08,640
C we just plug in the definition

1282
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:11,319
here uh so we want expectation of x

1283
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:14,279
minus the expectation of X but now X is

1284
01:03:11,319 --> 01:03:17,960
X plus C so we want

1285
01:03:14,279 --> 01:03:20,039
expectation of first term X is so I

1286
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:24,520
guess this is going to be for the square

1287
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:26,359
then uh the first X is actually X+ C and

1288
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:29,920
then we have minus

1289
01:03:26,359 --> 01:03:29,920
the expectation of X plus

1290
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:35,799
C uh and then that's squared and then we

1291
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:39,279
close the expectation and this thing is

1292
01:03:35,799 --> 01:03:44,799
what we just computed here so we have in

1293
01:03:39,279 --> 01:03:49,119
inside the Parn here we have x + C

1294
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:52,680
minus uh expectation of

1295
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:57,640
X plus C in

1296
01:03:52,680 --> 01:04:00,160
parenthesis and get my red chalk

1297
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,160
the C's

1298
01:04:06,279 --> 01:04:12,440
cancel right so we end up with x minus

1299
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,640
expectation of x squared and expect

1300
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:19,200
expected um and that's exactly the

1301
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:19,200
definition of variation of X variance of

1302
01:04:20,839 --> 01:04:25,880
X okay so that's kind of nice

1303
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:35,440
okay couple

1304
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:41,839
more one is here

1305
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,839
is another way to compute variance

1306
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,400
uh I can't say I have a lot of intuition

1307
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,920
for this one but it works out nicely

1308
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:15,039
mathematically variance of X is the

1309
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:19,240
difference between the expect the

1310
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:21,559
squared value expected and the expected

1311
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:23,640
squared the square of the expectation

1312
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:27,880
versus the expectation of the

1313
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:31,279
square with this sign turns out to be

1314
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,440
right uh I guess this is sort of related

1315
01:05:31,279 --> 01:05:33,720
to whether you do things inside or

1316
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:37,279
outside the expectation this is going to

1317
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:41,400
exaggerate larger values of X more and

1318
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:43,960
this uh adds them all up first and then

1319
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,400
squares so it's less dramatic and the

1320
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,720
difference in those dramas are exactly

1321
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,119
the variance turns out so we're not

1322
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:52,000
going to prove that you'll prove that in

1323
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:57,640
in recitation tomorrow but let's do a

1324
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:57,640
simple example of it so suppose we have

1325
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:02,400
a bias coin

1326
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:04,640
flip uh where the probability of heads

1327
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,640
is

1328
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:12,440
p and uh take an indicator random

1329
01:06:09,079 --> 01:06:14,559
variable H or equivalently this holds

1330
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:17,760
for every indicator random

1331
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:17,760
variable uh

1332
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:25,839
H we know the

1333
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,559
expectation of H is just probability of

1334
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:30,599
one which is

1335
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:32,920
p the

1336
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:36,160
variance is quite nice to compute with

1337
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:37,440
this formula because again with with um

1338
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,480
indicator random variables they're

1339
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:42,440
always zero or one and so when you

1340
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:46,240
square them nothing

1341
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:49,240
happens right so this is

1342
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,079
uh if according to this formula it's

1343
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:54,000
expectation of

1344
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:59,640
x^2 of

1345
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:04,319
h^2 minus uh expectation of H outside

1346
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:05,720
squared and H squ is equal to H because

1347
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,039
if you take zero you square it you get

1348
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:10,119
zero if you take one you square it you

1349
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:14,480
get one so this thing is just uh

1350
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:14,480
expectation of H which is

1351
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:20,319
p and then we have minus expectation of

1352
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:22,480
H squ well expectation of H again this

1353
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:27,480
is p so this is

1354
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:30,359
p^2 so P minus p^ 2 also known as P * 1

1355
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:32,760
minus P looks a little bit more

1356
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:34,599
natural um it's probability of heads

1357
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:38,400
times the probability of Tails turns out

1358
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:39,839
to be the variance in this case if you

1359
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,039
look at standard deviation it's the

1360
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:46,359
geometric mean between p and one minus P

1361
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,359
which is kind of a nice

1362
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:53,559
number

1363
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:57,440
okay next one uh do I want this

1364
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:57,440
example I might

1365
01:08:00,359 --> 01:08:03,400
let's go over

1366
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:11,359
here so expectation had this nice

1367
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:15,600
linearity property how about variance

1368
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:17,440
well it has this nice nonlinearity

1369
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:19,920
property it's not usually called

1370
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:24,279
nonlinearity of variance but it's kind

1371
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:27,159
of linear is uh

1372
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:28,960
so the the nice

1373
01:08:27,159 --> 01:08:31,279
part

1374
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:35,799
um yeah all right let's start with this

1375
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:35,799
part the less Nice Part the less linear

1376
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:43,560
part so while variance was scale inar it

1377
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:45,480
was um translation invariant is that

1378
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:47,600
what I called it yeah if I add something

1379
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,880
to X it doesn't change the variance If I

1380
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:51,440
multiply by something it it better

1381
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:54,319
change the variance right I mean that's

1382
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:57,239
the whole point of the investment say If

1383
01:08:54,319 --> 01:09:00,000
I multiply XI by a million that has

1384
01:08:57,239 --> 01:09:02,960
higher risk so variance should go

1385
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,080
up uh and it's a little funny because

1386
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:07,400
everything's squared so it doesn't go up

1387
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:09,040
linearly it goes up by c^ squ instead of

1388
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:11,920
C of course if you take standard

1389
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:15,120
deviation it is linear in this special

1390
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:19,199
case like if you take standard deviation

1391
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:22,359
of C * X it's going to be C * standard

1392
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:24,359
deviation of

1393
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:27,319
X okay

1394
01:09:24,359 --> 01:09:30,319
cool but what if we add

1395
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:32,880
to to random variables um here

1396
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:37,279
unfortunately we need Independence so if

1397
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,279
X and Y are independent random

1398
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
variables

1399
01:09:43,239 --> 01:09:51,560
then uh the variation the variance of

1400
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,560
the sum is equal to the sum of the

1401
01:09:54,159 --> 01:09:58,800
variations okay so it's not as nice as

1402
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:02,719
we had with expectation where it just

1403
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:05,600
always holds but still pretty

1404
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:07,000
good so if you sum things and multiply

1405
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,040
them by things it gets a little weird

1406
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,360
you've got to square all of these

1407
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:13,840
coefficients but these are sort of the

1408
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,400
analoges of the things we have in

1409
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:19,080
expectation this is again something we

1410
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:23,159
will uh you will do in

1411
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:26,159
lecture uh so I'm going to just do an

1412
01:10:23,159 --> 01:10:26,159
example

1413
01:10:30,199 --> 01:10:34,560
two

1414
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,560
examples related

1415
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:43,280
examples okay so uh let's say we have n

1416
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:48,360
mutually independent coin

1417
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:50,560
flips and I want H to be the number of

1418
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:53,440
heads this is what we were calling n

1419
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:54,920
before and maybe on this board H we've

1420
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,600
often called this H we've counted this

1421
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:59,679
before we've done the expectation uh

1422
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,600
twice now we did it last lecture and we

1423
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:05,880
did it at the beginning of this lecture

1424
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:08,199
the expectation of H is p * n if the

1425
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:11,480
probability of

1426
01:11:08,199 --> 01:11:11,480
heads is

1427
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:16,760
p okay what about the

1428
01:11:19,199 --> 01:11:23,199
variance uh

1429
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:31,719
and the idea just like when we computed

1430
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:36,000
expectation we split up H as a sum of

1431
01:11:31,719 --> 01:11:38,239
nhh where hi was uh an indicator ROM

1432
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,840
variable for whether the I flip was a

1433
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:46,360
heads

1434
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:49,840
hi is indicator ROM variable for I

1435
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:49,840
flip being

1436
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:56,400
heads uh and so then we just took the

1437
01:11:54,639 --> 01:11:58,320
sum here and so each of them had a

1438
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,760
probability P of occurring we so we got

1439
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:02,760
n of them got P * n let's do the same

1440
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:03,719
thing with variance because we're

1441
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,040
assuming these coin Clips are

1442
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:07,159
independent with the expectation we

1443
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:10,719
didn't have to but with variance we have

1444
01:12:07,159 --> 01:12:13,800
to so we can use this property this is

1445
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:18,760
going to be equal to by this kind of

1446
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:23,199
linearity of variance uh sum of variance

1447
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:23,199
of hi for IAL 1 to

1448
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:29,040
n cool so then we just need the variance

1449
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:31,719
of each individual coin flip which we

1450
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:35,120
just did right bias coin

1451
01:12:31,719 --> 01:12:38,360
flip uh probability P of heads variance

1452
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,360
was P * 1 minus

1453
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:49,520
P so we get n * P * 1 -

1454
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:52,280
P

1455
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:55,320
okay uh I find it a little hard to have

1456
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:57,360
intuition for this but uh it's a number

1457
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,840
here's here's another example last

1458
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:02,320
example will give you some intuition for

1459
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,320
why this is

1460
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:09,480
interesting back to gambling I mean

1461
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,480
investment uh let's

1462
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:17,159
say you have n doll you want to invest

1463
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:20,679
back to my great investment strategy

1464
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:23,440
here you can you can let's this xn now I

1465
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:27,920
could either invest I I could invest n

1466
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:30,080
in this thing and I get a Varan of n s i

1467
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:33,880
could win n lose

1468
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:36,239
n okay but now suppose there's not just

1469
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:40,880
one investment like this Suppose there a

1470
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:44,480
whole bunch of Investments like XI let's

1471
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:46,840
call them stocks right you have uh K

1472
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:48,360
different stocks and I can choose I'll

1473
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,440
invest so many dollars in this stock so

1474
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,600
many dollars in this stock so many

1475
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:53,800
dollars in this stock and let's just

1476
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:55,719
assume like this in great investment uh

1477
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:58,760
setup that each of them will either

1478
01:13:55,719 --> 01:14:01,480
double your money or you lose all your

1479
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:03,199
money does this make a difference is it

1480
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:06,239
any different to invest in K different

1481
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:08,000
stocks equally versus investing in one

1482
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:12,320
stock

1483
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,320
everything okay I claim they're

1484
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,600
different so let's do it in general and

1485
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,440
then we can plug in different values of

1486
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:21,719
K so let's say we have K different

1487
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:23,159
stocks and we're going to equally uh

1488
01:14:21,719 --> 01:14:26,239
split our investment

1489
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:28,239
of$ across those stocks

1490
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:30,360
and let's say that each

1491
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:34,120
stock

1492
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:38,639
SI is plus let's just do plus one and

1493
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:38,639
minus one simple of course you could

1494
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:43,560
generalize each of these occurs with

1495
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:46,120
probability a

1496
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:49,840
half just like our previous Investments

1497
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:51,440
but now each stock is uh let's say

1498
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,400
they're

1499
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:55,560
independent

1500
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:58,000
mutually independent

1501
01:14:55,560 --> 01:15:00,159
this is probably not a reasonable

1502
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:04,000
assumption do not invest in the stock

1503
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:05,600
market with this advice but if we assume

1504
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,080
that they're mutually

1505
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:11,920
independent

1506
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:15,560
then uh what we get if we want the

1507
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:25,120
variance of our overall outcome which is

1508
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:28,159
uh sum IAL 1 to n of n / K time SI

1509
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:29,800
right this is how many dollars I assume

1510
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:31,440
you know the basics of investment if you

1511
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:33,600
invest more dollars then you're G to

1512
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:37,239
either get more back or lose more just

1513
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:39,840
like this uh XI but I pulled the pulled

1514
01:15:37,239 --> 01:15:41,880
it outside so if we invest n overk

1515
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:43,679
dollars in this stock then we get we end

1516
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:46,120
up with this many dollars in the end we

1517
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:47,320
add it up over all stocks okay now we

1518
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,600
want to know the variance of this

1519
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:51,199
investment strategy which I'm going to

1520
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:53,800
call risk

1521
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:56,960
so probably risk is standard deviation

1522
01:15:53,800 --> 01:16:00,360
but if variance is lower so we standard

1523
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,560
deviation uh so the variation of sum if

1524
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:04,840
they're mutually

1525
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:10,520
independent uh is exactly the

1526
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:12,920
sum of the variations of the uh insides

1527
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:14,800
which is n over K *

1528
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:19,000
SI that

1529
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:20,280
was uh First Property um and then the

1530
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,360
second one if we want to pull this

1531
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:33,760
outside it gets squared so we get sum I

1532
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:34,880
= 1 to n of n / k s time variance of Si

1533
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:38,600
variance of

1534
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:40,920
Si is one I think this was the early

1535
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:44,239
example we did in general the the

1536
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:45,800
variance of this x i we're we're

1537
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:49,000
interested in the case I equals 1 over

1538
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:51,159
here uh the variance was i^ s so that's

1539
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,159
just

1540
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:57,080
one okay so we get the sum of something

1541
01:16:54,080 --> 01:17:00,679
that doesn't depend on on I so we just

1542
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:01,960
get n of these things we get n cubed

1543
01:17:00,679 --> 01:17:04,080
over

1544
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:05,880
k^2 this is our variance and if you take

1545
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:09,719
the square root you get the standard

1546
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:11,000
deviation okay and if you hold n fixed

1547
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:13,360
of course the more dollars you put in

1548
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,920
here the more risk you expect uh so it

1549
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:19,960
turns out to grow uh if you're doing

1550
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:22,880
standard deviation um you get n to the

1551
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:27,239
1.5 risk so don't invest a lot of money

1552
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:30,960
maybe um we get divided by K the cool

1553
01:17:27,239 --> 01:17:34,760
thing is the bigger K is the smaller you

1554
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:38,040
risk so this is why I conjecture this is

1555
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:40,040
why Financial people say diversify your

1556
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:41,880
portfolio because the more things you

1557
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:44,800
invest in if they're mutually

1558
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:49,000
independent it reduces your

1559
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:51,239
risk uh it's kind of a fun conclusion to

1560
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,320
variance of course if they're mutually

1561
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:55,639
dependent which stock market tends to be

1562
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:57,239
somewhat then you don't get this as much

1563
01:17:55,639 --> 01:17:58,920
of a benefit but you probably get some

1564
01:17:57,239 --> 01:18:01,320
benefit by diversifying so it's a good

1565
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:03,199
thing to do when you grow up and uh

1566
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:05,239
invest your money all right that's it

1567
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:09,080
for today one more lecture on

1568
01:18:05,239 --> 01:18:09,080
probability Tuesday
