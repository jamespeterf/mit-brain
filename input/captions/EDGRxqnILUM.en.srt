1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,640
um today we're g to continue our sort of

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,560
application we learned so far and today

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,400
we are going to really dive in and sort

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,960
of in some sense what we could sort of

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,439
consider consider the mother of all

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,800
market failures which is externalities

7
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,720
the classic the single most classic

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:35,200
example that economists use when they

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,200
talk about market failure is

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,280
externalities and today we're going to

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,920
talk about

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,239
externalities uh what they are why they

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,680
represent market failures and what

14
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,640
governments can do about

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,760
them so an externality

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:56,039
exists whenever the actions of one party

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,960
make another party better or worse

18
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,359
off but the first party doesn't get the

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,439
benefits or consequence of doing so

20
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,799
soever my actions make you better or

21
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,799
worse but none of the benefits of making

22
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,799
you better or the cost of making you

23
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,600
worse accre to me

24
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:19,320
individually in that context that's an

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,520
externality okay and we will talk about

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,159
why this C is a fundamental source of

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,280
market failure and we're going to talk

28
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,960
about four different types of

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,960
externalities so we're going to start

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,439
with the most classic case which is a

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,000
negative

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,200
production

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,640
externality this is the most classic

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,439
example of

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,040
externalities okay so suppose that

36
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,079
there's a a steel plant located on a

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,520
river how many guys read The

38
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,399
Lorax guys go excellent good job Dr

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,759
Seuss greatest second greatest author of

40
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,360
history behind Shakespeare is Dr Seuss

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,840
okay so the lorax tells the story of

42
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,640
this plant sort of dumping crap into the

43
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,079
river well think about The Lorax think

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,320
about a plant on a river a steel plant

45
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,280
in a river dumping sludge into the river

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,719
it's a natural byproduct of the steel

47
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,080
they's not making sedes he's making

48
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:12,800
steel natural bipart byproduct of the

49
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:15,280
steel plant is uh this sludge and every

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,840
unit of Steel that's made produces one

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,239
unit of sludge that gets dumped by a

52
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,160
pipe out the back into the river just

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,040
like in The

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,640
Lorax okay however the steel plant is

55
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,360
not the only user of this River farther

56
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,200
Downstream from the steel plant is a set

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,000
of fishermen and they fish in this River

58
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,640
and they make their living uh fishing in

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,280
this River and it turns out that the

60
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,480
sludge that the steel plant's dumping in

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,360
is killing the fish and hurting the

62
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,879
livelihood of the fisherman down the

63
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,519
river now this is a classic negative

64
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,879
production externality it's negative

65
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:52,879
because my action as a steel plant

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,000
affects another party which is the

67
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,760
fisherman it's production because it's a

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,959
byproduct of the production process

69
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,120
we'll talk later about consumption

70
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:03,680
externals you'll see the difference

71
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,720
um and so this is a classic negative

72
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,319
production externality and the way we

73
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,400
Analyze That is shown in figure

74
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,720
241 once again from my textbook okay we

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,799
think about the market for steel the

76
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,000
market Standard Market diagram you got

77
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:24,360
the quantity of Steel on the xaxis

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,920
you've got the price of steel on the Y

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:31,319
AIS you've got um uh a demand for steel

80
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
which is the blue downward sloping line

81
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,400
and supply of

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,040
Steel now the key distinction we're

83
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,000
going to make here that we haven't drawn

84
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,680
before is when we've talked about what

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,080
demand and Supply represent we've talked

86
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,640
about them as private Concepts the

87
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,400
domain curve is individual's willingness

88
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,159
to

89
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,280
pay the supply curve is an individual's

90
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,239
firm's willingness to

91
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,560
supply but implicit in that and implicit

92
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,680
in the welfare analysis would be way

93
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:06,200
back in lecture 12 is the notion they

94
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,120
also represent social curves implicit in

95
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,680
all the analysis we've done is the

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,879
assumption that the aggregation of

97
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,439
individuals represents society and

98
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,919
therefore what's best for individuals is

99
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,560
best for society so implicit what we've

100
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,320
done is that private benefits equal

101
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,639
social benefits so the domain curve for

102
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,759
example the slope of the domain curve is

103
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:32,080
the private marginal benefit of another

104
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,560
unit of Steel it's also the social

105
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,639
marginal benefit now we haven't raised

106
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,199
this before because it didn't matter

107
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,320
before but today it will likewise the

108
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,759
supply curve is the private marginal

109
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,039
cost a producing number unit of Steel we

110
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,440
just called it marginal cost we didn't

111
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:48,199
call it private but that's what it is

112
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,639
and we also represent that as a social

113
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:51,240
marginal cost of producing steel it's

114
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,759
what it cost Society to produce steel is

115
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,000
what it cost the

116
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:58,240
producer the difference with an

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,960
externality is social costs now deviate

118
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,919
from private costs so if you think about

119
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,199
what is the cost of producing unit of

120
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,680
Steel well there's the marginal cost of

121
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,160
that steel all the stuff that goes into

122
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,400
it plus there's the fact that every unit

123
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,479
of Steel creates unit of sludge and that

124
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,440
kills

125
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:19,000
fish now that is not a private cost the

126
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,440
steel planter couldn't give a it's

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,840
a social cost because but Society is

128
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,639
worse off because the fish are dying

129
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,240
societ is comprised of everyone in

130
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,280
society so the cost of producing steel

131
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,000
the social cost is now the

132
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,240
manufacturer's private marginal cost

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,960
plus the marginal damage so the social

134
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,680
marginal cost is the manufacturer

135
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,520
private marginal cost plus the marginal

136
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,039
damage that that production does to

137
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,400
society in this case society's

138
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,319
represented just by the

139
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,800
fisherman the other rest of society we

140
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,759
are going to assume to make life easy

141
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,160
that marginal damage is constant you

142
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,400
could imagine upward or downward sloping

143
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,319
marginal demand curves let's leave that

144
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,600
alone that which makes it harder all the

145
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,360
math and all the intuition goes through

146
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,759
assume a constant assume that every

147
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,919
single unit of sludge dump causes a

148
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,360
constant marginal demand marginal damage

149
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:15,520
MD in terms of killing

150
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:18,960
fish okay what does that

151
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,280
imply for both private and social

152
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,800
welfare so for private welfare for what

153
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,759
the market delivers what the this is

154
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,520
otherwise a perfectly competitive market

155
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,880
it delivers the outcome at Point a the

156
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,919
perfectly competitive market delivers

157
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,520
outcome at Point a with no externalities

158
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:36,000
that is also the socially optimal

159
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,120
outcome we covered that that's the first

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,319
fundamental

161
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,120
theorem but now we say no the social

162
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,720
cost is not the blue line it's the red

163
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,440
line it's the private marginal cost plus

164
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,160
the marginal damage which is a shift

165
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,199
upwards it's a constant shift upwards

166
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,560
because we're assuming marginal damage

167
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,280
is constant so the social Optimum is not

168
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,960
at a it's at

169
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,520
C in other words from society's

170
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,160
perspective the steel company

171
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,319
overproduces

172
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,599
steel why does it overproduce steel

173
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,000
because a steel compan is saying I'm

174
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:13,879
going to produce steel until the cost to

175
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,400
me equals the benefits to

176
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:18,520
Consumers but from society's perspective

177
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,000
you should produce D the cost to society

178
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,560
equals the benefits to society the

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,440
benefit to society is the demand

180
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,680
curve but the cost Society supply curve

181
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,560
plus the marginal damage as a result the

182
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,360
steel plant is overproducing steel

183
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,479
because it's not accounting for the

184
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,680
externality it's not accounting for the

185
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,759
Damage Done to the other party and as a

186
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,840
result we get overproduction of Steel

187
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,000
and a dead weight

188
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,440
loss the dead weight loss is a New

189
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Concept because we haven't had private

190
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,360
and social cost deviating before we've

191
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,879
seen deadweight losses before but this

192
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,039
is a new kind of dead weight loss that

193
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,199
arises because the fact that the steel

194
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,840
kills

195
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,520
fish creates an externality

196
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,360
which causes the steel producer to

197
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,520
overproduce steel and as a result of

198
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,440
that excess production of Steel we get a

199
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,919
dead weight loss dead weight losses

200
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,919
here's the trick are done relevant to

201
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,560
social marginal costs the ultimate goals

202
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:18,120
to have is to have social welfare

203
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,879
maximization that's at C not at a so

204
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,879
you've created a dead weight

205
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,360
loss okay questions a little

206
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,120
mind-blowing different concept question

207
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,120
about how this works yeah

208
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,200
no so see the thing is societ well it

209
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,959
depends defined Society the market can

210
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,919
only operate as the market the Market's

211
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:40,399
the market for steel that's what I've

212
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,839
drawn here Society being the government

213
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,519
could decide to address this and we'll

214
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,240
talk about later but the market itself

215
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,240
leads to point a so the Market's leading

216
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,120
us to overproduced

217
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,720
Steel okay so this is not a this is not

218
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,880
a positive analysis the positive

219
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,160
analysis we already know how to do posi

220
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,959
you get to point a this a normative

221
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,760
analysis which is point a is over

222
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,000
production producing too much course are

223
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,360
not accounting for the Damage Done to

224
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,920
the

225
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,600
fisherman okay let's drill this

226
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,880
intuition home by talking about another

227
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,680
case let's talk about a negative

228
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,720
consumption

229
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,040
externality let's talk about a negative

230
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,959
consumption externality the classic

231
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,480
example of which is

232
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:25,079
smoking when I

233
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:28,120
smoke I exert a negative effect on

234
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:29,480
society partly because um I raised the

235
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,040
cost of medical care for dealing with

236
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,880
with me when I'm old partly because I

237
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,920
create secondhand smoke but for lots of

238
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,920
reasons my smoking creates extra cost

239
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,920
for society so my smoking decision is

240
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,399
represented in figure

241
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,120
242 the cost of producing cigarettes

242
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,640
we're assuming no production externality

243
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,040
here so the supply curve is both the

244
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,040
private marginal cost and the social

245
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,399
marginal cost there's no production

246
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,440
externality but I choose to smoke it

247
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,680
point a or the market chooses smoking at

248
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,279
Point a which is where the so the

249
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,680
private marginal cost equals the private

250
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:10,480
marginal

251
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,000
benefit however the social marginal

252
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,279
benefit is lower than the private

253
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,880
marginal benefit the social marginal

254
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,560
benefit is equal to the private marginal

255
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,079
benefit minus the marginal damage which

256
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,760
once again I assume is

257
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,000
constant done by my

258
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,839
smoking in other words I over

259
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,320
smoke because when I decide to smoke I

260
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,560
just compare my benefits to the cost of

261
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,000
cigarettes I don't consider the fact

262
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,839
that I'm making you sick and making your

263
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,560
tax dollars go up by my

264
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:46,279
smoking as a result I smoke too much

265
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,720
from society's perspective think of

266
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,519
society as the bubble that includes

267
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,040
everyone whereas my decision is a bubble

268
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,959
that just includes me so I'm only

269
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,800
deciding based on me I'm ignoring the

270
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:57,519
rest of that bubble if my smoking

271
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,160
decisions affect the rest of that

272
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,000
bubble then I'm over

273
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,120
consuming okay and therefore we get too

274
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,600
many cigarettes consumed and a parallel

275
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,560
dead weight

276
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,680
loss okay this time it comes from a

277
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:15,880
shift in the demand

278
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:17,680
curve okay so that is another example uh

279
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,639
you note here we used a number we Ed 40

280
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,200
cents that's the best estimate 40 40 or

281
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,560
50 cents is the best estimate of what

282
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,360
the negative externality is from smoking

283
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,399
about 40 to 50 cents a pack if you add

284
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,920
up all the costs smokers impose on

285
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,200
society it's 40 to 50 cents a pack and

286
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,279
that's why we use that as a constant

287
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,639
marginal damage here so given this

288
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,200
there's over

289
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:43,600
consumption um of uh of

290
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,160
cigarettes externals can also be

291
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,639
positive we could have a

292
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,639
positive production

293
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,160
externality the classic example of that

294
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,600
so let's think about what we what we're

295
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,560
now you sort of are in the concept think

296
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,880
about what I'm going to talk about here

297
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,360
I'm going talk about something something

298
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,920
that firms

299
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,560
do that has benefits on others that the

300
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,839
firms don't

301
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,639
realize what's the classical example of

302
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,279
that research and

303
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:18,399
development when a firm does

304
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:21,000
R&D it creates new science which

305
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,399
benefits consumers but consumers pay for

306
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,079
that but other firms learn and go

307
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,440
further up the development curve based

308
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,279
on what the first firm did so if you

309
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,440
think about if you go go to figure

310
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:36,560
234 think about the market for R&D when

311
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,120
a firm's deciding how much R&D to do it

312
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,360
considers what's the cost of R&D R&D is

313
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,160
a cost you got to hire scientists and

314
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,800
build labs and so that's the uh

315
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,279
private marginal cost and there's a

316
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,839
benefit for R&D which is how many

317
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:53,320
patents does it deliver for the firm

318
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,800
that's going to drive the demand okay

319
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,600
what the firm is ignoring is that by

320
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,720
doing

321
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:03,079
R&D they are actually producing knowled

322
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,399
that cannot be held totally privately

323
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,440
eventually when the patent runs out it's

324
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,440
public even before that firms May learn

325
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,920
and that's going to benefit other firms

326
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,040
that's going to lower the cost of

327
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,120
development for other firms so there's a

328
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,959
social marginal

329
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,880
benefit which effectively lowers the

330
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:25,199
marginal cost of

331
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,760
R&D from society's

332
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:30,120
perspective when firms do R&D it's more

333
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,120
valuable than the firm at self

334
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,160
sees indeed the best estimates are that

335
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,360
the private rate of return to

336
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,440
firms is on the order of about 15 to 20%

337
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,160
pretty high rate of return because a

338
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,399
risky investment the social rate of

339
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,800
return which is accounting for the

340
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,240
benefits other firms get from that R&D

341
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,360
are something like two to three times as

342
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,639
large because of all the benefits of

343
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,720
society and one firm does it spills over

344
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:59,199
and other firms benefit as

345
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,360
well okay so that is a positive

346
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,759
production externality as a result firms

347
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,839
do too little

348
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,199
R&D just like a negative production

349
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,440
externality causes the steel plants to

350
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,519
produce too much steel a positive

351
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,839
production externality causes firms to

352
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,360
do too little

353
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,160
R&D okay that's one reason why in the US

354
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,800
we have a tax credit to promote

355
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:26,759
R&D finally we have the last example

356
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,240
which is a positive consumption

357
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,120
externality and here let me move away

358
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:35,040
from the graphs and talk about an

359
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,759
example okay um I have a neighbor who

360
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,480
I'm not fond of I may have mentioned

361
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:42,040
this before uh I do not like my neighbor

362
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,079
uh part of the reason I do not like my

363
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,680
neighbor is my neighbor has a tendency

364
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:48,959
to do big projects about halfway and

365
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,279
then stop because he gets bored one such

366
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,040
project he started about 20 years ago he

367
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:52,920
decided do a massive landscaping job on

368
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,440
his

369
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,160
yard and as part of that I produced a

370
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,079
giant mound of dirt that was directly

371
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,279
out the window of our kitchen and then

372
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,839
he stopped and that Dirt has sat there

373
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,560
for 20 years at one point my wife snuck

374
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,880
out and planted wild flowers on it so it

375
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,160
wouldn't look so bad but the bottom line

376
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:14,399
is we got this pile of dirt this guy

377
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,199
created so let's think about his

378
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,079
decision about whether to get rid of

379
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:20,199
that pile of dirt imagine that it would

380
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,279
cost him

381
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:24,759
$1,000 to get rid of that pile of dirt

382
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,800
and imagine because he doesn't mind

383
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,959
looking at dirt it's only worth 800

384
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,040
bucks to him so the marginal cost is a

385
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:34,639
th000 the marginal benefit privately is

386
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,440
800 you won't get rid of it but what if

387
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,680
it's also worth another 500 bucks to

388
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,600
me well in that case the social marginal

389
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,800
benefit is

390
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,279
$1,300 which is above the cost so he

391
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,880
should remove the dirt but he won't

392
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:53,360
because he's a jerk Okay and like he

393
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,279
doesn't care what I think he's just his

394
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,920
own and he's look he's not it he won't

395
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,600
not do it not just because he's jerk but

396
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,079
because he's considering his own private

397
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,240
marginal cost of medits it's not worth

398
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,600
it because it's an ex because removing

399
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,079
it would have a positive effect on me

400
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,639
and he's not accounting for that so he's

401
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,519
under he is underusing

402
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,360
Landscaping

403
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,360
okay questions about any of

404
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,360
this

405
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,079
yeah uh they're just twoo totally

406
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,319
different market

407
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,480
failures uh I think you know we could

408
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,680
discuss that more another time but

409
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,639
they're just they're really not related

410
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,279
in in fundamental ways I mean in

411
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,920
subsense you could think of information

412
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,480
Imes creating things that look like

413
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,519
externalities but they're just two

414
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,720
different ways the market can

415
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:45,399
fail um okay so now but my neighbor

416
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,279
example raises a really interesting

417
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,920
question okay I now hopefully have

418
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,240
convinced you extra NS exist they're

419
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,440
real they cause inefficiencies but do we

420
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,959
need the government to fix them I mean

421
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,360
after all I could go to my neighbor and

422
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:59,560
offer him 500 bucks to the Landscaping

423
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,839
right we don't need

424
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,000
government indeed there's a very famous

425
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,280
economist lawyer and Economist named

426
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,919
Ronald

427
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,480
Co who POS what we call the Coan

428
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:15,559
solution externalities which is just

429
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,679
negotiate okay

430
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:19,760
basically this

431
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,839
fisherman could say hey you're doing

432
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,559
this damage to our fishing let's

433
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,520
negotiate and have you produce less

434
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,400
steel okay so

435
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,039
basically theide idea is we don't really

436
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,679
necessarily need a government was K's

437
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:37,640
argument because we could solve some

438
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:40,280
negotiation in practice he's wrong and

439
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,600
he's wrong for a number of reasons the

440
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,000
first reason he's wrong is that the most

441
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,160
important externalities are not things

442
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,080
like me and my neighbor things like

443
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,280
global

444
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:51,440
warming global war is the ultimate

445
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,400
externality okay when you drove your car

446
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,320
last you were ever so incrementally

447
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,120
putting Bangladesh

448
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,400
underwater even if it's an EV Le as an

449
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,480
EV but even still okay did you think

450
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,200
about that did you think well I'm going

451
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,480
to drive you thought about my drive is

452
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,760
it worth it did you think oh but also

453
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,919
I'm putting Bangladesh underwater no you

454
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,440
didn't okay because that's an

455
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,559
externality you're not accounting for

456
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,440
that the problem is externality that's

457
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,960
created every day by billions of people

458
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,400
and affects billions of people how would

459
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,360
they negotiate how would the billions of

460
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,559
people who create carbon get to the

461
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,799
billions of people who are affected by

462
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:28,200
carbon negotiate they can't it's

463
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,280
implausible so one problem with Coast is

464
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,679
it's simply plausible for the most

465
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,480
important externalities which involve

466
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,360
many parties on both

467
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,640
sides that's the first problem with

468
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,760
saying we can have a private solution to

469
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:44,480
this okay the second problem is that

470
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,120
it's kind of socially awkward I mean you

471
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,720
notice I haven't in 20 years gone to my

472
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,360
neighbor and offered him $500 to get rid

473
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,320
of the Dirt Pile it's kind of socially

474
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,880
awkward it'd be kind of a super bizarre

475
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,400
thing to do right uh there's a famous

476
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,480
story of an economist who was on a plane

477
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,880
back before he had phones we used to

478
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,240
talk people on planes and is on a plane

479
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,640
trying to get some reading done and the

480
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,240
guy next to him wouldn't stop talking so

481
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,919
we offered him 10 bucks to shut up now

482
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,200
we laugh CU like in reality like that

483
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,320
can't be right no one would do that it's

484
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,000
just because it's not how we really

485
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:19,320
interact in society so there's both sort

486
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,400
of negotiating barriers and Norms that

487
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,320
get in the way think about a classic

488
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,919
classic negative production external

489
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,480
negative consumption

490
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:29,200
externality is when your neighbor in the

491
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,159
door room next to you plays their music

492
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,880
too

493
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:35,520
loud okay that they consumtion they are

494
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,799
choosing the the volume which optimizes

495
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,280
the Music Experience for them the

496
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,760
benefits and costs they're weighing off

497
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,520
they're not accounting for the fact it's

498
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,600
making it harder for you to study now do

499
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,240
you ever go to your neighbor and say

500
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,480
look I've calculated that this ladder

501
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,760
music will cause me to do five points

502
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,080
worse on my tests which will affect my

503
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,840
lifetime earnings by this amount pay me

504
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,679
this or turn down the music no you

505
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,000
either ignore it or tell them to stop it

506
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,320
you don't tell them to shut it off okay

507
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,280
we don't do coing negotiations in

508
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:10,120
reality okay and as a result this is why

509
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,120
we need to bring in Government

510
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,360
Solutions the government needs to step

511
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,640
in and solve the problem of

512
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,720
externalities now how can the government

513
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,679
solve this problem well one easy example

514
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,200
is they can just

515
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,880
regulate they can just regulate they

516
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,520
could say if the government knows what

517
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,280
the social opal production is it can

518
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,880
just impose it so for example let's go

519
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,400
back to our steel plants example okay

520
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,440
let's go back to figure

521
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,039
241 what if the government just came in

522
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,559
and said you know what steel plants

523
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:50,039
you're producing Q2 that's a socially

524
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,440
optimal amount then boom problem solved

525
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:53,400
we've produced a socially optimal amount

526
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,080
the government through regulation has

527
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,600
enforced the social

528
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,520
Optimum so that would be the the

529
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:04,039
theoretically sort of easiest

530
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:07,480
case the problem in practice is to

531
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:09,640
determine what Q2 is you need to know a

532
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,799
lot you need to know what the demand

533
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,200
curve looks like you need to know what

534
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:15,559
the supply curve looks like and you need

535
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,840
to know the size of the marginal

536
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:20,120
damage those are three hard things to

537
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,960
learn and in particular we've talked

538
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,320
before in the concept of Regulation

539
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,520
about why it's very hard to measure

540
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,919
these Curves in practice the firms will

541
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,720
lie to you about what the marginal cost

542
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,960
is it's hard to measure it it's hard to

543
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,840
consumers to actually reveal what

544
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,480
stuff's Worth to them for all the

545
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,559
reasons we talked about it's very hard

546
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,760
to actually in practice measure these

547
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:39,279
curves so there's a lot of information

548
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,159
need to gather to get that

549
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:44,240
right but what if there was a simpler

550
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,039
solution what if the government said

551
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,440
look I do know the marginal damage but I

552
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,799
don't know what demand and Supply curves

553
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,559
look like in fact you don't need to know

554
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:56,480
that because what the government can do

555
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,600
like I said it can

556
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,360
regulate which is sort of easy in theory

557
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,240
hard in practice the other thing it can

558
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,240
do corrective

559
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,279
taxation which is imagine if the

560
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:12,559
government went to the steel plant and

561
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:15,799
said I am going to Levy a tax of the

562
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:17,840
amount MD on every unit you produce all

563
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:20,240
I know is MD I don't know anything

564
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,559
else and it's only works MD is constant

565
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,679
but let's assume I know MD it's constant

566
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,559
then I can go to the steel plant and say

567
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,960
I'm going to Levy a taxing of MD what

568
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:30,039
would that do to the steel producer

569
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,320
decision well let's go to figure 24

570
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:34,279
44 the steel producer the former e was

571
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,799
at

572
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:39,159
a now the government is coming along and

573
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:44,120
saying I'm going to Levy a tax on every

574
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:46,960
unit you produce a marginal tax of MD

575
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,919
will that raises their marginal cost by

576
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,760
the amount MD therefore shifting their

577
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,559
private marginal cost curve up to the

578
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,799
point where it equals the social

579
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,840
marginal cost curve what the government

580
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:03,480
does through corrective taxation is

581
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:06,760
caused the firm to internalize the

582
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,919
externality by basically pricing the

583
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,840
externality it causes the firm to

584
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:14,320
incorporate that into their

585
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,240
decisions

586
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,080
thereby thereby doing so getting to the

587
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:24,039
socially optimal

588
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,039
outcome so the government can

589
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,760
essentially solve this problem with

590
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,919
fairly limited information knows what MD

591
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,039
is it can solve this so for example one

592
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:36,159
of my former colleagues Michael

593
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:38,919
greenstone served in the Obama

594
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,520
Administration and his main goal there

595
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:44,120
was to measure what he called the social

596
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,880
cost of carbon which was what is the

597
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,440
marginal cost of what each unit of

598
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,240
carbon does in terms of damage through

599
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,640
global warming obviously incredibly hard

600
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,840
calculation but we have lots of

601
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,760
engineering models about how carbon

602
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,440
affects the environment he computed the

603
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,240
social cost of carbon this is incredibly

604
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,400
important because this became a basis

605
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,279
for thinking about how we can tax the

606
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,240
use of carbon if greenstone's

607
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:08,880
calculations were right he came up at

608
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,279
the point time was about $50 per ton of

609
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,440
carbon $50 per ton of carbon is

610
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,679
something like I forget it's something

611
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,320
like 25 cents a gallon of gas maybe it's

612
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:21,240
closer to 50 cents I don't remember

613
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,000
exactly we could just say look that's

614
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,799
the tax every time you use carbon you're

615
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,559
going to pay this tax at a social cost

616
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:31,039
and we would cause people to internalize

617
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,080
the externality we could address global

618
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,080
warming with one

619
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,279
calculation that one calculation is

620
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,919
simply what is the damage the margin of

621
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:42,080
carbon doses does to the world to the US

622
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,399
or the world we have to decide what

623
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,159
we're optimizing and then we're done

624
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:49,240
incredibly powerful if you think about

625
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,840
it okay and this is the beauty of

626
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:56,120
corrective

627
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:59,440
taxation okay note that um what you have

628
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,120
here is a

629
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,240
let's go back to last

630
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,960
lecture last lecture we talked about the

631
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,080
dead weight loss of

632
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:12,120
Taxation we talked about how taxes

633
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,039
create dead weight loss because they

634
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,919
reduce the quantity produced trades that

635
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,520
are productive are not

636
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,720
made here we're saying a tax gets rid of

637
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:24,559
a dead weight loss it's exactly the

638
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:29,360
opposite why because the trades it's

639
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,880
getting rid of are not socially valuable

640
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,520
when you have a negative externality

641
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,520
there are socially invaluable trades

642
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,840
being made all the units consumed

643
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,159
between q1 and

644
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:43,360
Q2 are losers for society so if you go

645
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,360
back to figure 241 everything to the

646
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,399
right of

647
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,799
Q2 has a social marginal cost above its

648
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:50,960
private marginal benefit its social

649
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:54,200
marginal

650
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,840
benefit those units which are hurting

651
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,440
Society so by taxing the firm we are

652
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,880
bringing them to the social margin to

653
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,399
the socially optimal outcome so taxes

654
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,960
can create dead weight loss taxes can

655
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:07,360
also get rid of dead weight loss it

656
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,840
depends on your starting point if your

657
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,760
starting point is already the socially

658
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,240
optimal outcome then taxes create dead

659
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,159
weight loss but if you're starting from

660
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,960
a point of maybe too much production

661
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:22,520
taxes can reduce dead weight

662
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:25,679
loss okay and that's kind of how we uh

663
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:28,960
how we think about it okay questions

664
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,960
about that

665
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:34,679
okay now let's talk about government

666
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,520
policy in practice let's talk about what

667
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,520
the government does in

668
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,559
practice because this is one of the most

669
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,600
important things the government does is

670
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:47,360
regulate and address

671
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,760
externalities and let's talk about the

672
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,919
two biggest sources of negative

673
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,760
externalities that we have the first is

674
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,760
environmental

675
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,880
externalities and of course as I said

676
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,240
the mother of all externalities which is

677
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,760
global warming this is it this is the

678
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,760
most important external that exists it's

679
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:10,919
it's an existential threat to life on

680
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:13,840
Earth okay and it is a classic

681
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:16,520
externality because our use of carbon

682
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,640
our little use of carbon is creating

683
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,640
damage to the entire future of the world

684
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,720
okay so it's a classicality when I drive

685
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,960
my car I don't acknowledge the damage

686
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,799
that's being

687
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,159
done okay so basically uh and we all

688
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,399
know how terrible global warming is I

689
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,039
don't have to give you the scary facts

690
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,360
uh carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is

691
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:39,799
now its highest level in 400,000 years

692
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,799
um temperatures have risen by more than

693
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:43,720
one degree Fahrenheit in the last 70

694
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:46,760
years which is the most rapid increase

695
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,679
in the last 10,000 years um what you

696
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,880
might not know is how bad it's going to

697
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:54,080
be uh basically scientists predict that

698
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,039
by the end of the century uh 20 to 40%

699
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,880
of Bangladesh will be underwater Cape

700
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:59,039
cot will be gone much of Florida will be

701
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,679
gone

702
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,559
um and the economic D the economic

703
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,960
damage to Society on the order of10

704
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,080
trillion uh uh in terms of uh in terms

705
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:14,679
of economic damage indeed the the world

706
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:17,519
as a whole will be about 10% poor by

707
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:22,360
2100 uh if uh through the physical

708
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:23,799
damage done by global warming okay so

709
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,679
what could the government do well I just

710
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:29,000
described an easy answer corrective

711
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:31,640
taxation we use engineering models to

712
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,120
compute the social cost of carbon like

713
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,760
greenstone had us do and

714
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,960
we say okay we're going to put that into

715
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,760
a tax we'll basically compute for every

716
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,720
carbon producing activity how much

717
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,679
carbon it produces and we'll tax it

718
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,519
accordingly

719
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,399
indeed Europe does this a lot if you've

720
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:52,120
ever driven in Europe gas even at

721
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,480
today's high prices is about twice as

722
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,080
expensive in Europe about twice as much

723
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,320
per gallon of gas in Europe it's hard to

724
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,760
mislead if you see the signs because

725
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,559
it's done by leader it's all you got to

726
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,720
convert but it's basically about twice

727
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,519
as expensive why because of

728
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,440
taxes because European nations

729
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:10,480
significantly tax gasoline we tax

730
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,720
gasoline but at a much much lower

731
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:17,519
level okay they have much higher taxes

732
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,720
now so the easy answer is let's just tax

733
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:24,240
gas here the problem is

734
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,679
political Bill Clinton who was president

735
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,480
had a lot of controversies during his

736
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,039
presidency one that them talked about a

737
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,039
lot is he osed a 3 Cent per gallon tax

738
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,679
on gasoline and that was one of the most

739
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,919
consequentially negative things he ever

740
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,559
did for his electoral prospects a lot of

741
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,760
the reason that Republicans took

742
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:44,399
Congress in 1994 was because Bill

743
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,640
Clinton's 3 Cent a gallon tax proposal

744
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,960
gas tax

745
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,960
proposal so basically we know the right

746
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,399
answer the answer economists have pushed

747
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,799
for for 50 plus years which is a carbon

748
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,159
tax but politically it's been

749
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,360
challenging there therefore the

750
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:05,399
framework that's been adopted since

751
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:08,360
1992 is instead Quan

752
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:10,679
regulation and in particular a cap and

753
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,600
trade

754
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:16,399
system for regulating carbon what that

755
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,840
means is we're going to we're going to

756
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,799
limit each company is going to limit how

757
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,480
much carbon it

758
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,200
produces okay that's the cap part it's a

759
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,240
regulatory

760
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:32,799
Target okay but we're going to allow

761
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,559
countries to trade to take advantage of

762
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:40,080
efficient opportunities let me explain

763
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:44,480
what this means so basically um in the

764
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:47,640
US we do not it is very expensive to

765
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,360
convert to clean energy and the reason

766
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,000
is because we built an entire economy

767
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,440
around dirty energy think of a simple

768
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,919
example if I want a natural gas plant I

769
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,399
got to First tear down the coal plant or

770
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,279
retrofit the coal plant to get the

771
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:02,360
natural gas plant if you take

772
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,799
China they're building new plants

773
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,440
rapidly well it's not that much more

774
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,760
expensive to build a natural gas plant

775
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,440
than a coal plant so for them it's cheap

776
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,760
to convert from gold to natural gas

777
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,279
because they're going to build a plant

778
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,039
anyway they don't have to tear something

779
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:18,039
down it's a very crude description of

780
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:20,519
why it's cheaper but roughly speaking

781
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:24,039
it's cheaper for developing

782
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:25,399
countries to grow to grow in a more

783
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:28,240
environmentally sensitive way than us

784
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:30,720
for us for us to retrofit our economy

785
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,919
now that's great but if you go to these

786
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,320
countries say that they're like you you

787
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:37,120
guys got to party you put all this

788
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,639
carbon in the air now you want us to fix

789
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,320
it no way we get to have air

790
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:41,559
conditioning we get to have

791
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,320
refrigerators all the stuff you guys

792
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:46,080
benefited from for all these years now

793
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:49,720
we're going to get it so the challenge

794
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,720
is the quantity idea makes

795
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,919
sense but the problem is how do you get

796
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,399
the world to buy in and the way you get

797
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,559
the world to buy in is but through

798
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:02,279
trading the idea here is let's have

799
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:05,039
permits of how much carbon can be

800
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:08,919
polluted and let's make those permits

801
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:10,320
tradable so the US can say to China look

802
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,159
it's very expensive for us to reduce

803
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,559
carbon it's less expensive for you so

804
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:15,559
what I'm going to do is I'm going to buy

805
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,200
from

806
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:20,960
you your clean production I'm going to

807
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,559
essentially pay you off to the reduction

808
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,760
that I would otherwise have to do so in

809
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:29,679
other words instead of inefficiently the

810
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:33,440
US reducing pollution a lot and China

811
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:35,279
not much we're going to more efficiently

812
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,360
have the US send China a bunch of money

813
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,480
and have China do the pollution

814
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,880
reduction and you know it's the same

815
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,240
outcome because it's global warming a

816
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,000
unit of carbon in the air doesn't matter

817
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,880
where it came from we are totally IND

818
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,960
different worldwide where carbon comes

819
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,919
from so if we have someone who can

820
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,080
produce it more efficiently and some

821
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,279
produce it less efficiently it makes

822
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,320
sense for the less efficient guy to

823
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:56,639
bribe the more efficient guy and that's

824
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,720
how we get this system to

825
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:01,639
work okay okay now this is a brilliant

826
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,919
Insight that economists once again dude

827
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:06,279
Economist pioneered for many years

828
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,919
environmentalists were were against this

829
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:10,960
they've adopted it um and this is how we

830
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:13,320
try to regulate carbon now the problem

831
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,399
is it's still politically enormously

832
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,200
challenging because ultimately the costs

833
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,399
of using carbon have to one way or

834
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,679
another go up we will never really solve

835
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:25,840
the problem of global warming until we

836
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,440
make the cost of

837
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:33,519
carbon feature the damage they're doing

838
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,919
okay now the Biden Administration took a

839
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,559
somewhat different T to this they said

840
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,159
look economists for years have been

841
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,880
saying tax carbon regulate carbon

842
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:44,080
politically we're getting nowhere here's

843
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,720
a different idea let's subsidize green

844
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,799
energy remember the opposite of a tax is

845
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,600
a subsidy so instead of trying to tax

846
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:55,080
the bad stuff let's subsidize the good

847
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,279
stuff and the inflation reduction act

848
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,360
which was passed last year has hundreds

849
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:02,360
of billions of dollars for subsidies

850
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,960
things like a $7,500 tax credit if you

851
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:09,200
buy a us-made electric vehicle subsidies

852
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,839
for discovering new uh new sources of

853
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,440
green energy for carbon capture for

854
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:15,000
hydrogen development Etc basically

855
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,079
saying look politically it's a lot

856
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,720
easier to spend money than tax money so

857
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:22,359
let's spend money to try to jump start a

858
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,639
green economy that can move forward

859
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:25,919
politically it was

860
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,399
brilliant okay practically it's still

861
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,440
not enough ultim Ely if we're going to

862
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,720
truly as a world address global war

863
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,240
we're going to have to make people face

864
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,679
the true price for what they're doing

865
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,720
which is to make carbon more expensive

866
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:42,800
okay questions about

867
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:45,200
that all right let's talk about the

868
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,440
other big topic the other big source of

869
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,200
negative externalities which is Health

870
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,839
ex negative Health

871
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,119
externalities negative Health

872
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:57,400
externalities so much of there's a

873
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:00,480
there's a class of goods that are

874
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,839
sometimes called sin Goods smoking

875
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,079
drinking driving because it causes uh

876
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,359
because it causes global warming other

877
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:12,079
drugs and much of the consumption that

878
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,240
we do of these sin Goods imposes

879
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,320
negative externalities on others so for

880
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,000
smoking I already mentioned there's

881
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,520
higher medical costs we spend about 80

882
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,440
billion dollar a year in medical costs

883
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,760
due to smoking related

884
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,200
illness um there's secondhand smoke

885
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,800
there's fires thousands of people die

886
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,400
every year in fire started by smoke ERS

887
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,280
etc for drinking this drunk driving we

888
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:37,280
have 13,000 deaths a year and 400,000

889
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,480
injuries a year due to drunk driving

890
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,440
classic externality if I drive when I

891
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,760
decide to get behind the wheel okay I'm

892
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,599
weighing the benefits and cost of

893
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,040
driving drunk I'm not accounting for the

894
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,160
fact that I might ruin your life or ruin

895
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,319
your family's

896
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,359
life okay we have gasoline we talked

897
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:54,720
about that and Other Drugs indeed drug

898
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,640
overdose deaths are now the largest

899
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,520
cause of accidental death in the US

900
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,160
about 100,000 people

901
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,839
year here's the tricky

902
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,480
thing when are things externalities is

903
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:09,520
not obvious because

904
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,599
remember the definition it's when my

905
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,160
actions affect you but I don't bear the

906
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,000
consequence think about drunk driving I

907
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,079
do bear the consequences of getting

908
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,640
caught so is that really an externality

909
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:25,440
because I bear the consequences or let's

910
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:29,359
take the case the interesting case of

911
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,079
smoking imagine that someone Sat by

912
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,440
themselves on a rock in a nonflammable

913
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,880
part of the world and smoked themselves

914
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,680
to

915
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,200
death would there be externalities from

916
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:46,880
that

917
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:48,680
no okay or imagine that I um smoke and

918
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,280
uh and it does ultimately raise my

919
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:54,319
medical costs but my insurers charge me

920
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,040
more indeed for the first time in

921
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:57,800
history the Affordable Care Act which I

922
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,240
talked about in the last lecture allow

923
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,119
insurers to charge smokers more for

924
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,720
their health

925
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,359
insurance well if the amount I pay in

926
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,079
extra premiums is equal to the damage

927
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:09,560
I'm doing by smoking then there's no

928
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:11,119
more externality I've internalized it so

929
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,920
externalities only arise when they're

930
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,920
not

931
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,839
internalized that's a very important

932
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:21,280
thing feature to think about okay so the

933
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:24,560
key is that people don't bear the

934
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,960
cost okay let's talk about secondhand

935
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,680
smoke let's imagine the way secondhand

936
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,480
smoke works smoke you all cough let's

937
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,119
imagine way secondhand smoke worked was

938
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,599
I took my cigarette and stabbed you in

939
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,599
the arm with

940
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,839
it let's imagine second smoke work by

941
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,359
taking my cigarettes that that's the

942
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,560
only way second Head smoke could affect

943
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,240
you would that be an

944
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:49,599
externality maybe not because you could

945
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,720
punch me you could sue me you could make

946
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,160
me bear the cost of that secondhand

947
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,079
smoke why is secondhand smoke an next

948
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,240
because no one owns the air so you can't

949
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,280
sue me for smoking in the in in the air

950
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,079
unless there's a law that says I can't

951
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,440
so external

952
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,040
arise when there's not an individual

953
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,160
remediation that can make the person

954
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:14,599
bear the cost okay an important

955
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,680
distinction now when we think about Sin

956
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:19,040
consumption of sin Goods the government

957
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,000
has a wide variety of tools it can try

958
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,720
to use to address the

959
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,440
externalities okay the first is so what

960
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,040
are the government tools one tool is

961
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,160
information

962
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:35,720
the government can tell people

963
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:41,520
hey what you're doing uh is um is really

964
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:43,040
bad okay uh indeed um for smoking

965
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,680
information's played a huge role in the

966
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,599
US in the 1950s half of all Americans

967
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,760
smoked half of all Americans smoked and

968
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,040
of all education groups smoking rate was

969
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,200
pretty equal across the entire

970
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,440
distribution of

971
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,160
income then we started realizing smoking

972
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,400
was bad for you and about 1980 smoking

973
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,200
started to fall but here's what's

974
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,960
fascinating it fell differently by

975
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,599
education group smoking when the Highly

976
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,079
Educated has virtually

977
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,760
disappeared smoking on the less educated

978
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:13,359
continues to be lower but still

979
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,440
consequential still about 18% of

980
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:17,240
American

981
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,680
smoke the limitation information is only

982
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,079
works if people process it and use it

983
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,680
and account for it in their

984
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,760
decisions okay so the limit information

985
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,680
it's really created the in the

986
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,680
information solution has created just

987
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,760
sort of more inqu quity in who smokes in

988
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:35,240
America so that's one

989
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:38,960
solution the other solution is taxes we

990
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:40,440
can basically try to get smokers to

991
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,880
internalize the

992
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,480
externality by taxing

993
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,520
them okay and now that only works of

994
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,960
course if people respond to taxes by

995
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,119
smoking less and it turns out they do it

996
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,599
turns out people are somewhat price

997
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,359
sensitive just think price estimated

998
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:59,800
elasticity aboutus point4 that for every

999
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:03,560
10% you raise cigarette prices people

1000
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:05,760
smoke about 4% less so one way to

1001
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,000
address those your tax indeed smoking's

1002
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,880
declined enormously it declined slowly

1003
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,160
starting 19 due information it picked up

1004
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,280
rapidly after 2000 due to massive

1005
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,640
increase in taxes on cigarettes is a lot

1006
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,760
of what drove the decline in smoking in

1007
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,720
the US from 50% to

1008
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:24,440
18% okay and that's great but while

1009
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,079
that's an easy answer for cigarettes

1010
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,960
it's much harder for other externalities

1011
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,760
take drinking

1012
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,160
the first couple drinks might actually

1013
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,680
be good for you we don't know but

1014
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,160
certainly you know many many people

1015
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,480
thing is every cigarette you smoke is

1016
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,480
bad for you there's no such thing a

1017
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,160
cigarette's good for a harmless

1018
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,400
cigarette every cigarette's bad whereas

1019
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,240
drinks much of drinking is not harmful

1020
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,440
to you indeed if you look at the big

1021
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,839
source of externalities of drinking the

1022
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:53,119
biggest source of externality is drunk

1023
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:54,200
driving well most of us will drink

1024
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,800
successfully in our lives without

1025
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,560
driving drunk so if I deal with alcohol

1026
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,760
by tax it it's a little bit harder

1027
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,160
because what I'm doing is I'm collecting

1028
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,359
a lot of the revenues people who won't

1029
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,560
cause the

1030
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,880
damage so that's a harder issue to deal

1031
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:11,040
with politically that's a little more

1032
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,920
challenging think about the number one

1033
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,400
Health externality facing our society in

1034
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:19,599
The Next Century

1035
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,359
obesity okay one in every three babies

1036
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,319
born in America today will love diabetes

1037
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,680
before they die one and three because of

1038
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,800
the Obesity crisis more than 30 35 % of

1039
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,079
Americans are

1040
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,319
obese once again huge inequality I don't

1041
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,839
think I've taught an obese student at

1042
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:38,520
MIT in 10

1043
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:41,119
years okay but 35% of people your age or

1044
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,160
30% of people your age are obese so

1045
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,560
there's a huge amount of

1046
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:48,119
inequality okay in that the trick is

1047
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,359
address not through taxation is hard

1048
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:52,240
because we all know eating is actually

1049
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:53,960
pretty good for you you got to eat so

1050
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,960
addressing obesity through taxation is

1051
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,720
really

1052
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,800
hard okay we can't just tax food that's

1053
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,200
going to really hurt poor people so that

1054
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,040
becomes a place where it's even harder

1055
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,520
to addess through

1056
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:10,520
taxation okay a third solution we can do

1057
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,520
is

1058
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,079
penalties for example losing your

1059
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,200
license if you drive drunk that's great

1060
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,200
because that targets people who are

1061
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,720
causing the

1062
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,599
externality if you guys drink a little

1063
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,119
and you're fine you're not causing

1064
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:27,880
externality so this T targets the person

1065
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:31,160
causing the externality

1066
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:34,079
the problem is it doesn't really help

1067
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:36,440
penalties change in Behavior remind

1068
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,359
relies on me making a rational decision

1069
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,839
to say wow I better not drunk drive

1070
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:42,359
because I'll get caught when you're

1071
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,440
drunk you're not exactly making rational

1072
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:47,480
decisions problem with penalties is they

1073
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,119
sort of don't work if the sin good

1074
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,200
itself is causing

1075
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,960
irrationality ATT Tax Works because you

1076
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,880
just don't buy it in the first place say

1077
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,599
wow I can't afford that a penalty

1078
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,040
doesn't work because it involves Forward

1079
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:00,400
Thinking of the Tye that might not be

1080
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:07,640
done why consuming these

1081
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:07,640
Goods okay well then finally we have

1082
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,559
illegality illegality we could just say

1083
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,400
look it's illegal and that's in fact

1084
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,839
what we do with hard drugs in this

1085
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,520
country and in Most states still with

1086
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:24,280
marijuana we make it illegal we say look

1087
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,280
there's these externalities so not

1088
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,559
people consume it the problem with that

1089
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:32,280
is that is is almost certainly not

1090
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:35,280
optimal because

1091
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:37,720
remember even if there's externalities

1092
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,720
unless those externalities are enormous

1093
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,920
or

1094
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,079
infinite some people still derive

1095
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,920
benefits above the social

1096
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:48,119
cost okay some people still right now

1097
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,480
say cigarette taxs are close to Optimal

1098
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:51,480
but people still choose to smoke does

1099
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,359
that mean we should ban smoking not

1100
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,720
necessarily it might mean that they just

1101
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:58,680
enjoy smoking so much they're willing to

1102
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,880
pay eight bucks a pack for cigarettes

1103
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:04,599
so basically the question is whether you

1104
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,640
should ban an activity is depend very

1105
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:10,040
much on whether you think the

1106
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,319
externality is so large that overcomes

1107
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:14,640
any possible benefit of consuming the

1108
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,119
good that's exactly the way we're having

1109
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,000
now oh and there's one other thing

1110
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:20,839
there's another wrinkle which is if you

1111
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,280
think about it what is the largest

1112
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:25,400
source of externalities for illegal

1113
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,400
drugs the crime associated with

1114
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,319
obtaining and distributing those drugs

1115
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:32,800
which would not happen if they were

1116
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:32,800
legal so not

1117
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,480
only might the extern not be infinite

1118
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,720
actually making the goods illegal

1119
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,040
creates externalities in a way that

1120
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,319
taxing them would

1121
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,319
not and this is the argument for why

1122
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:48,520
many people supported legalization of

1123
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,880
marijuana because basically argument was

1124
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,640
look there's externalities of marijuana

1125
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,720
people driving High still kill people

1126
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,680
it's less bad than drunk driving there's

1127
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,359
still some

1128
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,200
externalities but they are not large

1129
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:01,720
enough to rule out the benefits some

1130
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,079
people get from consuming

1131
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,000
marijuana and we're creating new extra

1132
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,559
Nows by making it illegal all the money

1133
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,079
we're spending on police all the money

1134
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:11,839
we spent on jails all the damage that's

1135
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:14,559
done by enforcing those laws and that

1136
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:16,240
was the argument for making marijuana

1137
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,480
legal and that's an argument that's one

1138
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:20,000
in some states and not one in others you

1139
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,599
have to ask yourself why does AR going

1140
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,319
to apply to marijuana and not cocaine or

1141
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:29,559
heroin okay well if you really want to

1142
00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:32,079
have a co coherent argument you've got

1143
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:35,240
to argue that the

1144
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,960
externalities from cocaine or heroin are

1145
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,920
so much larger than

1146
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,559
marijuana that we should allow marijuana

1147
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,040
to be legal and cocaine and heroin to

1148
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:48,119
not be legal and in fact you'd be wrong

1149
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,839
in fact the externalities from these

1150
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:51,240
Goods largely arrive from the illegality

1151
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,359
and that is why most economists think

1152
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,440
all drugs should be legal not most

1153
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,480
economists many economists think all

1154
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,680
drugs should be legal

1155
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,599
taxed that we should follow the model

1156
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,079
that we showed in figure

1157
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:06,119
244 we should have corrective taxation

1158
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,280
account for the externality not B the

1159
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:10,559
good now I hope that discussion made you

1160
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,520
a little

1161
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,800
uncomfortable as it does me and the

1162
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,640
reason it made you

1163
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:22,000
uncomfortable is because the framework

1164
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,480
we're using Embraces key assumptions

1165
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,240
that have been unstayed this whole

1166
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:29,559
semester assumptions like rationality

1167
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,079
okay what we're going to do next time is

1168
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:32,280
ask how everything changes when we

1169
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,880
question those assumptions and we're

1170
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,000
talking about behavioral

1171
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:37,960
economics but I wanted you to leave you

1172
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,400
with this to remember absent behavioral

1173
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,720
economics which talk about next time

1174
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,040
it's really hard to justify making

1175
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,359
something illegal okay on something like

1176
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,760
externality grounds alone all right

1177
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:51,640
let's stop there we'll come back next

1178
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,640
time talk about behavioral economics
