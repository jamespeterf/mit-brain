1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,279
So I'm going to uh just show you about

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,880
what's going on at the Plasma Science

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,120
and Fusion Center, what's going on on

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,200
the ground uh and sort of where future

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,880
directions are for fusion, right? So we

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,039
start always with the description of

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,359
this because

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,199
why why do you do fusion energy? Well,

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,359
it's actually the universe already

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,359
voted. It is literally the reason life

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,279
exists in the in the universe. In fact,

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,160
the interesting atoms in your body were

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,440
made by fusion in stars and and life is

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,800
possible in the universe because of

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,320
fusion because that's what happens at

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,040
the center of stars and powers the

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,520
universe. So fusion basically takes

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,680
isotopes of hydrogen which are highly

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,079
available fuses them together to make

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,160
helium which is a very stable nucleus

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,239
and this releases massive amounts of

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,360
energy and in fact transforms it. In

23
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,440
fact that's what the sun is. It's

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,160
basically an enormous conversion engine

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,440
between hydrogen and helium. uh this has

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,920
to happen at extremely high

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,480
temperatures. So therefore all fusion

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,799
happens in the plasma state of matter

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,760
which is the fourth state of matter and

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,280
it only occurs in one place naturally in

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,439
the universe which is at the center of

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,760
stars because it's the only place where

33
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,159
the temperature requisite temperatures

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,920
to achieve the fusion reactivity exist

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,920
and the center of ownar is about 20

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,159
million degrees and it has enormous

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,920
pressure and it's basically the the way

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,479
it works is that it has that temperature

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,880
and isolation thermal isolation to stay

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,960
hot. uh because of the enormous forces

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,439
of gravity. That's why star but gravity

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,439
is extremely weak force. So basically in

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,119
the end if you want to translate this to

44
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,360
earth you need to figure out a way to

45
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,280
make star-like conditions but actually

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,880
happen in a container on earth which

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,840
means you have to replace gravity with

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,880
another fundamental force. Right? So why

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,280
do we pursue it as uh as as an energy

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,119
source on earth? So you get no polluting

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,159
emissions because the thing that it

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,719
makes is helium. Right? The fuel supply

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,840
is inexhaustible because it comes from

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,280
water and and and and the the light the

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,799
light abundant elements is basically

56
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,880
dutarium and lithium which come from

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,640
water and you get so much energy per

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,640
unit mass you basically cannot run out

59
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,599
of it. It's a it's it's also free

60
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,680
basically too. Um you also get 10

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,599
million times more energy than you can

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,840
get in a chemical reaction. So that's a

63
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,000
pretty big factor that's that has a that

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,360
that coincides with fision energy which

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
basically you get the same factor as

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,800
that. Unlike fision though because it

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,440
doesn't run on a uh it doesn't run on a

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,120
a chain reaction you actually is it it's

69
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,560
physically impossible to have a runaway

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,879
chain reaction. So you cannot directly

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,239
weaponize fusion. Meltdowns are

72
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,920
physically impossible because there's

73
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,840
not enough thermal energy in the system

74
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,599
to actually make that happen. So you

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,239
don't actually physics gives you safety

76
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,720
in fusion not engineering design. And

77
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,400
basically we've known this as as uh as

78
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,239
Klaus pointed out since we understood

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,239
how stars worked which wasn't that long

80
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,640
ago by the way give us a bit of a break

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,319
you know as a species right uh we're

82
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,760
actually coming up it's going to be in

83
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,080
about three or four years will be the

84
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,239
100th anniversary of when we understood

85
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,920
how stars work and what the fusion

86
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,519
process was. So, it's hasn't been that

87
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,920
long, right? I like to point out to my

88
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,519
students when my mother was born,

89
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,120
humanity didn't know how the universe

90
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,640
worked, right? Because we didn't know

91
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,959
about fusion. Okay? Um, and the key

92
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,280
other part of this is because of those

93
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,879
features, um, it's a it's a unique

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,120
energy source in the sense it's not

95
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,200
limited by the traditional kinds of

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,440
things that limit other kinds of energy

97
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,680
sources, which is access to some kind of

98
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,680
raw resource. So, in the cases of

99
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,200
petroleum, that's an obvious one. But

100
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,599
even in other things like in solar and

101
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,920
wind, it's access to places that have

102
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,680
wind and solar or hydroelectric things.

103
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,799
It's like that's not what fusion is.

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,440
Fusion is a purely technologydriven

105
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,159
uh energy source, not not not a resource

106
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,760
uh limited one, right? So it's it's like

107
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,599
the it's like the digitalization of

108
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,840
energy. That's what I like to say. And

109
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,400
if you in fact look at these this is

110
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,040
about why why you pursue this is that in

111
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,200
the end like these limitations around

112
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,439
like why is it hard, right? because well

113
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,599
chemical and fision reactions happen at

114
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,280
near room temperature. Fusion has to

115
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,239
happen on earth at about 100 million

116
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,760
degrees. Um but you cannot and because

117
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,760
this comes from the physics like the

118
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,000
things that come out of fision and

119
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,479
chemical reactions have significant

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,479
consequences. In the case of of

121
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,840
petroleum it has to do with CO2. In the

122
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,680
case of fusion it has to do with the

123
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,680
byproducts that come out of it and you

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,360
can't avoid those. In the in the case of

125
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,440
fusion in the end it is it is just

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,120
literally helium and another subatomic

127
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,280
particle that you actually recycle in

128
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,360
it. So those fundamentals are always

129
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,880
there. Just the question is like can you

130
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,360
actually achieve these conditions to

131
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,320
actually make this work right? So how do

132
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,120
you do this? So the way that you do this

133
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,759
is you as I as I stated you have to

134
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,960
replace uh the mechanism how it works in

135
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,440
the sun or in any star. And what this

136
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,520
requires is a containment force. But it

137
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,400
cannot be a physical containment force

138
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,360
because anything terrestrial that is in

139
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,120
contact with the fusion plasma fuel will

140
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,880
make it go cold and therefore the fusion

141
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,960
will stop. These are other reasons why

142
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,919
it's inherently safe because any the

143
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,160
moment it gets cold it instantly stops.

144
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,840
So in fact it's the the analogy I like

145
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,520
to do. So, a power plant that would be

146
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,160
running Cambridge um uh Massachusetts,

147
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,600
if I went like that on on the fusion

148
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,600
fuel, it would stop all fusion instantly

149
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,440
because it can't be at room temperature.

150
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,440
So, what does that actually mean? It

151
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,720
means the difficulty is that you have to

152
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,800
provide an a force which basically

153
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,400
exerts a pressure on this fuel to

154
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,800
isolate it away from anything

155
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,199
terrestrial. It can't even contact air,

156
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,880
right? So, how do you do this? Well, you

157
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,400
have to use the fundamental forces of

158
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,840
nature. And one of those is the

159
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,680
electromagnetic force, which is much

160
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,680
stronger than gravitational. And it

161
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,440
turns out one of the features of plasmas

162
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,280
is because it's very hot, all the

163
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,639
particles in it have a charge. And when

164
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,960
you immerse charged particles in a

165
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,120
magnetic field that it exerts a force.

166
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,560
So the the size of that force goes like

167
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,000
the strength of the magnetic field. And

168
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,759
in the end, what you do is you have a

169
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,759
there's a variety of these of these

170
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,120
configurations. The most common one is

171
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,639
this thing called a tokamac which is

172
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,240
basically just a configuration of

173
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,520
electromagnets which are those things

174
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,680
going around which make a magnetic field

175
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,600
which is immersed in the that is

176
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,880
immersed in the plasma. So the

177
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,479
interesting the plasma know there's a

178
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,479
magnetic field there because it exerts a

179
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,240
force on it but the magnets don't know

180
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,240
that there's a thermonuclear plasma

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,520
inside of it and neither does the plasma

182
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,199
know that there's magnets on the

183
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,440
outside. They just it's it's essentially

184
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,440
like a force at a distance. So that's

185
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,240
the nature of the isolation about how we

186
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,919
basically then hold the star in place.

187
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,240
Uh and because the the force is orders

188
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,240
of magnitude larger than gravity, this

189
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,000
allows you to now reduce it to a size

190
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,840
that you can actually place it in this

191
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,560
room rather than have to be the size of

192
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,560
a sun. Right? There's another way that

193
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,280
you can do this is that you can actually

194
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,960
use grav it's it's a different it's not

195
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,960
actually gravitational force. It's a

196
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,840
pressure force. And what you do is you

197
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,280
take lasers and you and you and you you

198
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,840
basically have a spherical target of

199
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,000
fuel. You ablate the uh outside of this

200
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,400
and by and by basically like an inverse

201
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,199
like an inside out rocket. What you do

202
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,680
is you so rapidly compress the fuel that

203
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,919
it gets hot in the center and basically

204
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,919
it ignites fusion. So you can actually

205
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,000
do this and actually MIT works on on

206
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,199
both of these uh both of these. I'll get

207
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,520
back to some right. So, you know, it's

208
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,319
important to remember is that while I'll

209
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,440
get to economics is like like this is

210
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,680
hard. This is this is really hard

211
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,800
science, right? And and it's this thing

212
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,759
that sits at uh the intersection always

213
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,960
of difficult science and and and and at

214
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,960
the edge of of technology, right? So,

215
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,960
this is just so for example, this is a

216
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,000
picture over here what's showing down on

217
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,479
the bottom right. Um so you this is this

218
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,120
is showing a simulation which is based

219
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,199
on decades of research around being able

220
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,680
to understand microurbulence that is

221
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,240
happening in in this plasma this fuel

222
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,240
that's uh immersed in this magnetic

223
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,160
field and it turns out because when you

224
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,000
heat it what happens is it drives

225
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,479
gradients. So these are the equivalents

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,639
of like solar flares that you see in the

227
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,360
sun this is happening in the inside of

228
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,199
the fusion device. So it turned out just

229
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,120
even measuring these things took a

230
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,639
decade of development because it was so

231
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,720
hard. These these are perturbations

232
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,280
which are at the order of only of a few

233
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,960
percent and things like the temperature

234
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,719
uh and and the and the and of the

235
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,399
background plasma. But it turned out

236
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,880
this was in fact what was limiting the

237
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,560
performance of of of it. Uh here's a

238
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,080
picture over here is my colleague Zach

239
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,440
Zack Hartwig over here one of the other

240
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,760
co-founders of Commonwealth Fusion

241
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,760
Systems. So we you'll I'll show you a

242
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,600
picture that this was a development of a

243
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,120
new magnet technology which has opened

244
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,480
up the possibility for commercial

245
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,880
fusion. But because the magnet itself

246
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,200
was in completely new territory, there

247
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,880
was literally nothing to test it with.

248
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,720
So we actually had to develop a

249
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,640
completely new technology just to

250
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,640
complete the test, let alone the actual

251
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,640
new technology. And there and and this

252
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,720
is not small science, right? This is one

253
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,200
of the largest experimental halls on the

254
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,519
MIT campus. You can see the size of

255
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,360
these kinds of things and and Zach uh I

256
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,279
hope he's being safe there uh standing

257
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,519
on top of it with cryogenic uh things

258
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,680
coming out of it. Yeah. So in the end

259
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,600
this is what fusion is it's it's it's

260
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,680
actually why you have fusion at a place

261
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,519
like MIT. It is the ultimate

262
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,680
multidisciplinary

263
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,440
uh endeavor. This is not just physics

264
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,040
but you have to know physics. It's

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,279
integrating pretty much every

266
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,200
engineering discipline and uh and many

267
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,560
and most of the scientific disciplines

268
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,800
as well too. That's why we have the

269
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,600
PSFC.

270
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,600
Um, so just to get back to some like why

271
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,519
are we excited about fusion and have we

272
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,839
made break and like I get interviewed a

273
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,680
lot like why are we excited about fusion

274
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,920
and there's basically three reasons and

275
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,920
I'll go through them. One of them is we

276
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,440
have made breakthroughs in the science

277
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,200
of this after decades of very difficult

278
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,120
research. we have we've gotten the place

279
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,279
in it and then probably the most

280
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,600
exciting scientific result is the is

281
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,000
this one is that in California a few

282
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,600
years ago as I said what they did was

283
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,959
they use these lasers by the way these

284
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,640
are these laser beams which are coming

285
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,880
in this is an extraordinary

286
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,560
accomplishment of technology each of

287
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,240
those each of the it has 192 lasers uh

288
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,680
each of those lasers was the biggest

289
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,600
laser built by humanity uh and then they

290
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,760
then they aim it at a thing which is the

291
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,000
size of about the the tip of my little

292
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,720
finger, right? And instantaneously the

293
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,120
power in those layers uh those lasers is

294
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,120
about triple the entire electric output

295
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,800
of the United States. Like wow, right? H

296
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,399
the reason you can do that is because it

297
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,720
happens for a billionth of a second,

298
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,519
right? It illuminates the inside of this

299
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,040
one of gold and other exotic materials,

300
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,640
creates an X-ray bath, and then that

301
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,800
X-ray bath illuminates this uh fusion

302
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,200
fuel target which is in the center. and

303
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,839
on fraction of a of a mil billionth of a

304
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
second so rapidly compresses it that you

305
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,040
get adiabatic heating in the center of

306
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,120
this and you reach the requisite

307
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,000
temperatures which are required to do

308
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,480
this so it took a decade of dedicated

309
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,640
research with MIT at the lead of a lot

310
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,160
of the this is very very difficult to

311
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,079
measure this because it's happening in a

312
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,519
billionth of a second so we actually had

313
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,000
a division um uh we have a division at

314
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,760
the fusion center training and in fact a

315
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,440
lot of the breakthroughs were done by

316
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,040
previous MIT students who were at the

317
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,560
Livermore National Laboratory where this

318
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,920
happened as well too. So we had a major

319
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,160
part in this. Um and after a decade of

320
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,320
of of under better understanding of

321
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,720
this, we finally got it to the point

322
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,880
where this actually exceeded the point

323
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,720
where the the total amount of energy

324
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,880
that was being released from the fusion

325
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,519
exceeded the amount of energy that was

326
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,880
being delivered by the lasers. So this

327
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,560
is still a far away from

328
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,800
commercialization, trust me. But this is

329
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,320
an enormous scientific accomplishment

330
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,480
because it showed us something really

331
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,560
important which is that namely it got

332
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,560
the fuel to the condition that it looked

333
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,160
like the sun. Right? You know this is

334
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,639
nothing plugged into the sun. It runs

335
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,120
itself. The how that works is because

336
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,279
fusion works by heating the fuel. So

337
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,680
when fusion reactions occur that

338
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,000
releases heat into the fuel and it's

339
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,800
that that heat that temperature that

340
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,200
then allows future fu fusion reactions

341
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,720
to occur. So instantaneously what

342
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,320
happened in a billionth of a second is

343
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,399
that this created so many fusion

344
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,639
reactions that the temperature of the

345
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,560
fuel spontaneously increased by a factor

346
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,920
of four

347
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,480
and that condition uh that self-heating

348
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,480
is a necessary and fundamental part of

349
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,040
every fusion concept that you will ever

350
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,000
have. So the fact that we know that this

351
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,399
works was an enormous check off of the

352
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,639
scientific risk list even even though

353
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,680
the technology itself has a this one has

354
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,519
a ways to go right to that one. But the

355
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,959
one that's the furthest along in terms

356
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,360
of commercialization is magnetic

357
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,680
confinement fusion. So as I said before

358
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,000
I described this before you create these

359
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,519
extremely large you have these strong

360
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,600
magnetic fields which are immersed in

361
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,000
it. So how do we know that this is close

362
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,320
to the commercialization? Because on the

363
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,959
MIT campus, we actually operated this

364
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,360
device called Alcatore Sea. It it ceased

365
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,959
operations about 8 years ago. But in

366
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,519
this thing which is about the size of a

367
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,360
coat closet and there it goes. So this

368
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,279
is immersed in magnetic fields which are

369
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,279
about a million times stronger than the

370
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,360
earth's magnetic field and in something

371
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,560
that I can actually wrap my my hands

372
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,079
around that had temperatures which ex

373
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,720
which are five times hotter than the

374
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,480
center of the sun. So was a about 100

375
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,519
million degrees and that was done about

376
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,320
30 times a day, right? And in fact in

377
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,160
that device we in fact exceeded another

378
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,000
key parameter which is that it exceeded

379
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,000
two atmospheres of pressure from the

380
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,920
plasma. So it turns out a power plant

381
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,399
has to operate at about four uh

382
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,560
atmospheres of pressure. Wow. Like this

383
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,639
is not mythology. This is real science

384
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,160
that was actually done. The pro the

385
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,480
challenge with this one though was that

386
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,560
while this science was was very

387
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,000
illuminating and in particular this this

388
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,639
what this came from was the deep

389
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,959
expertise at MIT about producing very

390
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,440
strong magnetic fields is that to

391
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:18,160
produce that magnetic field we had to

392
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:21,600
use about 250 megawatts of electricity.

393
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,680
Oops, that was bad. Right? So it was a

394
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,920
science demonstration. So what we had to

395
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,320
do was translate that into how would you

396
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,279
then commercialize that? Right. Oh,

397
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,160
sorry. Right. So, how you commercialize

398
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,160
that is sorry that's in the few slides.

399
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,000
So, this is in fact why we have the

400
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,240
PSFC. So, you're starting to get some

401
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,839
sense of the scale around this. Right.

402
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,240
So, I was as I said I was the director

403
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,279
Dun Lorero is now the director. This is

404
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,560
not your typical this is not a Bunson

405
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,959
burner and a postocck right to do fusion

406
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,680
you need scale right uh and I think this

407
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,600
is one of the other uh attributes of MIT

408
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,920
which I very much in fact I'm coming up

409
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,440
to my 20th anniversary of being lured to

410
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,920
MIT um it was this like the ability to

411
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,320
do research and integrated research at

412
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,639
scale and immerse it in the educational

413
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,480
experience is really quite unique to MIT

414
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,519
I'm not just and this happens not just

415
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,920
at the PSFC to places like Rlecale. So

416
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,839
what do we have? This is a 20 200 It's

417
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,519
like I it's almost like a small national

418
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,920
lab immersed at a university like

419
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,519
250,000 ft of lab space. Not just lab

420
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,920
space but things that can handle

421
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,600
ionizing radiation, large power. There's

422
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,360
if you take everybody in including

423
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,760
visiting scientists, it's almost 300

424
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,320
people there. 90 graduate students,

425
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,079
right? Obvious, right? And we take up a

426
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,360
city block which is over here. And very

427
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,360
important, you see over here that we

428
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,800
actually also encompass the magnet lab

429
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,399
as well too which is over here. And by

430
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,320
the way, there's the nuclear reactor

431
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,920
right beside us. So we have a lot of

432
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,440
more interactions actually going on

433
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,120
right now because of course we share

434
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,839
nuclear engineering as a discipline with

435
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,800
our colleagues over in fision, right? So

436
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,199
why are we all excited about this? Well,

437
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,720
it's mostly because remember I told you

438
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,240
there's basically three things that have

439
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,160
changed fusion in the last few years.

440
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,800
One of them was a major scientific

441
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,560
breakthrough which is that we see now it

442
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,959
will work if we get this if we get the

443
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,519
plasma to the right state. We we didn't

444
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,360
that wasn't confirmed before. And this

445
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,600
is the second one which is an

446
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,680
interesting one because it's both a

447
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,720
technological but it's also an

448
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,360
organizational innovation is that you'll

449
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,120
never get there if this always stays in

450
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,360
government labs because it will always

451
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,800
just be a science project which is

452
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,279
totally fine if you want to do science

453
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,199
projects. But if you want to save the

454
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,440
world, you got to build companies and

455
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,360
you have to make products as Sergey will

456
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,279
keep telling you uh and you have to

457
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,440
build economically efficient products

458
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,600
that actually that allow this to come to

459
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,079
market and you have to do that with

460
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,920
companies. So you know so what we did

461
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,079
was that we realized that there was a

462
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,639
technology innovation which I'll get to

463
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,240
actually run around on this um that what

464
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,800
it allowed was for a a great a vast

465
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,880
change not just infusion performance but

466
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,679
infusion economics

467
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,760
um and because of that realization we we

468
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,919
understood that in order to to deliver

469
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,120
on this we needed to be able to launch a

470
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,439
a private company and that was

471
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,360
Commonwealth Fusion Systems and what we

472
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,520
have built is basically a seven-year

473
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,000
partnership that has co-developed the

474
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,799
magnets and MIT has obviously the the

475
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,400
science uh and educational lead on this

476
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,360
and and Commonwealth Fusion Systems

477
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,520
which has now raised about $3 billion of

478
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,600
private money and its purpose is

479
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,240
commercialization because MIT can't hold

480
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,480
that purpose uh directly and in fact it

481
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,640
was not just a technical innovation I'm

482
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,240
vastly proud of the organizational

483
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,200
innovation that we did in this is that

484
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,280
we came up with a extremely transparent

485
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,480
licensing and working relationship that

486
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,440
particular particularly in the early

487
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,440
vulnerable stages of the technology. MIT

488
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,520
and and the company worked hand in hand

489
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,360
to actually develop this technology and

490
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,280
that and that collaboration continues to

491
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,720
go forward. So what is it doing? Well,

492
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,799
it's basically building this guy here.

493
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,600
It's called Spark. It's about 40 uh

494
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,919
minutes away in the western suburbs of

495
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Boston. And then this little object you

496
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,360
can produce, and this is why you would

497
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,520
now get excited. Okay, so this will

498
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,280
produce around uh 200 million watts of

499
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,120
fusion power.

500
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,960
And unlike the example that I showed you

501
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,200
before, it's actually only a factor of

502
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,760
about two away from that device that I

503
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,760
showed you with a picture an but these

504
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,679
new but it has a new kind of magnet

505
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,919
around it that can produce a stronger

506
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,280
magnetic field and consumes zero

507
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,760
electricity because it's a

508
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,760
superconducting magnet.

509
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,520
So if you count up all of the power

510
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,679
going into it to get it hot compared to

511
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,840
the fusion power, it makes 10 times more

512
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,240
fusion power than the power it takes to

513
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,400
get the fuel hot.

514
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,480
And this fits in the corner of this

515
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,679
room.

516
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,679
So now the idea is and and by the way

517
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,120
compared to the previous technology it's

518
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,400
40 times smaller than this. And you

519
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,160
might have heard of this project called

520
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,600
it's called Ear which is in the south of

521
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,520
France. It's the world's largest

522
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,960
scientific project and that was one of

523
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,120
its problems. It was the world's largest

524
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,520
scientific project. Yeah you can see the

525
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:14,480
people standing beside it.

526
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:17,520
So what we developed uh with much toil

527
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,840
uh in fact this uh so what we developed

528
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,799
uh at the PSFC and then launched through

529
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,480
uh CFS was not just a technology but it

530
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,640
was a commercialization plan and it was

531
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,960
actually it was driven by if you're

532
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,960
going to make fusion uh attractive and

533
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,200
viable as an energy source you have to

534
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,120
get its cost to performance much much

535
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,880
better and you have to shorten the

536
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,039
development time. So that's what we did.

537
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,960
It was this really well-laidout plan and

538
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,679
in particular what this rested on were

539
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,760
were three uh things which were we had

540
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,960
the science of high field fusion and

541
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,240
then it was we had to build a

542
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,640
demonstration of this new kind of

543
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,559
superconducting magnet and this then

544
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,480
particularly this part we did in close

545
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,960
collaboration with commonalth fusion

546
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,039
systems. Oops. Um and then

547
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,880
Commonwealth's job was to start

548
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,480
commercializing around on those things.

549
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,039
Get out there raise money. In fact that

550
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,280
number is now 2.8 billion uh dollars as

551
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,440
well too. And then we collaborate on

552
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,400
this demonstration project called spark

553
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,840
which itself is protocommercial.

554
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,600
And then the idea is that that all

555
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,440
drives itself towards because this works

556
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,520
at the same specifications as this which

557
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,919
is arc which is the first commercial

558
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,600
fusion power plant. And I have to take

559
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,480
some pride in this is that this was in

560
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,280
fact uh this was invented in my fusion

561
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,280
design class. So the are this is another

562
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,039
hallmark of MIT is that and then the

563
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,960
students I had basically 12 MIT graduate

564
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,280
students saved fusion and maybe the

565
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,760
world actually around on this and those

566
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:46,880
students now run the company like that's

567
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,880
MIT. Yep. Um so uh and and no it doesn't

568
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,039
stand for Iron Man's uh fusion power

569
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,679
reactor in his chest because that would

570
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,159
be a trademark infringement. Um in fact

571
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,200
a very so we're basically we are seeing

572
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,360
this all the way through and of course

573
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,600
it's CFS's job to build this because it

574
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,039
is a commercial endeavor but of course

575
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,080
there's a lot of research to do around

576
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,720
on this and now recently uh in fact uh

577
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,559
just under a year ago the site and

578
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,080
commercial partners for building ARC are

579
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,760
set it's just outside of Richmond

580
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,679
Virginia uh at an ex uh at at a an

581
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,159
existing power station it's just south

582
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,919
of uh Virginia an interesting story of

583
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,640
that the reason that that site became

584
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:28,080
available able is because the local town

585
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,400
voted down um they they they basically

586
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,720
voted down uh the installation of a new

587
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,440
gas fired power plant there but they

588
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,039
open they they welcomed with open arms

589
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,640
the installation of a fusion power

590
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,440
plant.

591
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,679
Wow. Yeah. I've been on the site. It's

592
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,679
quite inspiring. Yeah. So what what

593
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,200
happened it was basically this. It was

594
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,679
this new I won't go through the details

595
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,600
of this but it was this new like almost

596
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,039
honestly like a miracle technology came

597
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,559
along. It was a new kind of

598
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,039
superconducting material called rare

599
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,039
earth barium copper oxide which what it

600
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,440
allowed was it had much higher tolerance

601
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,240
to very strong magnetic fields. So this

602
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,880
is what we built um in the span of about

603
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:10,320
3 years. Uh in fact another interesting

604
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,480
aspect of like this is an ILP conference

605
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,600
about an academic place working

606
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,000
alongside of a a commercial company

607
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,280
because that had took private investment

608
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,039
to do this. We said they said okay we'll

609
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,760
take this risk with you but you have to

610
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,520
deliver this in three years and we had a

611
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,760
nationalmy's report that said it would

612
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,280
take 15 years.

613
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,039
How are you going to do it? Well, that

614
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,280
was very interesting because what you

615
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,000
had to do is basically take a startup

616
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,880
attitude, right, of quickly build,

617
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,200
learn, fail this go at this really break

618
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,280
neck pace but still have incredible

619
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,799
science and technology innovations. So

620
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,799
there's something like 30 patents

621
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,880
involved in this as well too. And it

622
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,679
basically just was basically broke all

623
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,000
kinds of grounds and not just the

624
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,000
performance of the magnet but also the

625
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,159
scalability of the magnet. And the thing

626
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,480
that I'm the most proud of this in this

627
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,159
one and I got to write the physics paper

628
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,559
the physics validation which was an

629
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,799
incredible paper to read because it

630
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,120
broke new ground and and the physics of

631
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,640
superconducting magnets all amazing. The

632
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,280
thing I'm the most proud of is the fact

633
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,280
that there was CFS had a factory

634
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,799
building these magnets in less than a

635
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,440
year after the demonstration of this

636
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,440
magnet. And that was the other power

637
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,200
actually of coupling a place like the

638
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,559
PSFC and and and and um and a company

639
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,039
right along it. So what did it do? It

640
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,880
produces 20 Tesla magnificion times the

641
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,480
earth's magnetic field. And it was that

642
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,799
doubling of the magnetic field that

643
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,520
overnight basically changed the cost per

644
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,039
watt by about a factor of 40. And that

645
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,720
goes back to Sergey's comments. This is

646
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,799
why it was fusion was too expensive

647
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,320
before and now we've got a shot at it in

648
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:51,520
fact. Right. Right. Oh, it's also this

649
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,760
it's also uh uh the other amazing thing

650
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,760
about MIT is it alumni. This was this

651
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,320
was also started by a million-doll

652
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,799
donation by somebody who was an MIT a

653
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,840
fan of conservation and wanted to see

654
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:07,120
this actually have a chance. So this is

655
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,280
amazing. Now, um I would say that we had

656
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,440
no while while there were a few fusion

657
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,320
companies that existed before us, the

658
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,559
mere existence of MIT launching a fusion

659
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,360
company and raising $3 billion and

660
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:22,400
bringing like the who's who of investors

661
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,880
to the space uh really changed this. So,

662
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,480
not only uh did it did it launch

663
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,720
Commonwealth Fusion Systems, this

664
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,360
basically launched an international race

665
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,120
for commercializing fusion. uh and here

666
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,919
and you can see it's it's pretty heavy

667
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,799
USA based uh on this there's over $10

668
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,480
billion raised uh in this there's over

669
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,120
40 fusion companies I have an industry

670
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,000
association I love competition actually

671
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,480
in this space I'll also take with some

672
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,240
in fact I I I I took a as I said I took

673
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,480
a year sobbatical after stepping down as

674
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,039
the director uh and when I came back to

675
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,039
teach my design class I seen all those

676
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,559
fresh students out in the in the and I

677
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,960
realized I looked at this thing and it's

678
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:03,679
like oh my gosh five of those companies

679
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,400
were basically directly inspired that

680
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,240
the the CEOs or the ideas came out of

681
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,480
that design class. So it's not just

682
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,919
Commonwealth fusion systems were in fact

683
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,320
we're making these because so many of

684
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,520
them also use the new Rebco magnets as

685
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,880
well too. So very very exciting times uh

686
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,919
in that one.

687
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,240
So what's this is also spurred now is

688
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,480
basically this is because of the promise

689
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,520
of commercialization it has spurred a

690
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,600
geopolitical race in this space. So

691
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,000
here's the third thing that changed

692
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,760
right around on this which was in fact

693
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,400
it was two things at the same time which

694
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,840
was basically almost nobody talks about

695
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,120
fusion for uh decarbonization anymore.

696
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,039
That's actually not what it's about.

697
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,240
It's about energy security and it's

698
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:53,200
about supplying a delta in energy for

699
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,679
data centers which is a beautiful irony

700
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:59,600
because we're going to use AI like crazy

701
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:02,080
to actually make fusion work. Yes. Um,

702
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,440
and because of the geopolitical

703
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,440
importance of energy security and AI,

704
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,360
now national governments are stepping in

705
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,400
in a major way and understanding that if

706
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,400
you because if you can unlock this at

707
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,400
the right price point, it's the largest

708
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,720
geopolitical disruption of the century.

709
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:23,360
It's bigger than AI

710
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,440
because you can't do AI without energy.

711
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,480
again the biggest polit geopolitical

712
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,200
disruption of the century probably of

713
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,880
humanity actually because you will never

714
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,520
actually have to worry about energy

715
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,000
access ever again

716
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,080
just think about that right we are not

717
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,919
there but that's the prize that is out

718
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,760
there okay so what has this meant this

719
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,279
meant the UK has stepped in in a major

720
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,120
way in fact that slide is out of date

721
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,200
they've committed billions of pounds

722
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,960
actually to this already and they've

723
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,600
established a national program that puts

724
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,640
the US to shame actually on on this one

725
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,559
about commercializing fusion and China

726
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,919
has literally copied everything that

727
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,760
we've done. They actually admit they've

728
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,919
copied everything we've done. We we

729
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,799
published that paper, that magnet. They

730
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,360
actually in 14 months they replicated

731
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,120
that magnet. The entire supply chain

732
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,400
construction of that magnet and its

733
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,320
testing in 14 months.

734
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,480
So they're spending about about four or

735
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,080
five billion dollars actually into this.

736
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,440
And they're also putting us to shame

737
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,159
actually in this. In fact, it's a

738
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,240
national disgrace that the US government

739
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,080
in fact is sitting on his hands while

740
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,039
the major innovations actually in the

741
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,679
space have been spurred on by US indust

742
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,799
uh US industry and universities. It's

743
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,720
kind of amazing. Call your

744
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,400
congressperson please about this. If

745
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,480
you're an American company, if you live

746
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,600
if you're from from some other country,

747
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,760
good because you're you're you're

748
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,760
kicking you're kicking us on. Japan has

749
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,640
emerged actually already on this as well

750
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,760
too. And this is very interesting

751
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,080
because it's going to become

752
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,679
geopolitical because of the consequences

753
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,320
actually of this as well too. So like

754
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,000
the G7 now has a working uh group on

755
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,399
fusion energy. Wow.

756
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,320
So where's the where's the PSFC now?

757
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,320
Well, it's one of those fulcrum points

758
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,880
because we're not an industry. We're

759
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,120
still a research lab. But I would say we

760
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,760
turned around the purpose of the PSFC.

761
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,480
The PS the purpose of the PSC before was

762
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:19,039
multiddisciplinary research around this

763
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,640
this this science topic of fusion and

764
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:25,679
now our purpose is to support and uh

765
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,440
incubate basically a new energy industry

766
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,039
right and so what does that mean this

767
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,480
means you have to have extremely broad

768
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,919
sponsorship not just from this

769
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,320
traditional sponsors like the department

770
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,159
of energy and NSF and particularly

771
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,880
they're proving to be fickle sponsors

772
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,840
around this and need to get the RP is a

773
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,799
great one by the way because it

774
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,960
commercial focuses and

775
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,720
commercialization. Over here you can see

776
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,520
we have some of the companies that we

777
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,360
helped launch like CFS. We have deep

778
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,799
runs with type and these are a variety

779
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,640
of different kinds of configurations.

780
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,799
NTO which is another one that we came

781
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,039
out of the class and and I see Roberto

782
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,960
here in uh Ian and I was has been an

783
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,360
incredible sponsor of this both as a

784
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,039
member of mighty uh and all this and in

785
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,120
fact was one of the real thought leaders

786
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,960
in the energy space about supporting

787
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,279
this at a very early stage and in fact

788
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,679
is is is distributed widely around in

789
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,120
the fusion world. So this is amazing

790
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,880
actually for a place. But all I would

791
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,279
say is that you recognize to this

792
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,520
audience is that our purpose now has

793
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,000
changed and our and our ability to

794
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,760
couple into industries and think about

795
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,360
like emerging industries and think about

796
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,960
what that means is that that's really a

797
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,720
hallmark in fact of what of what the

798
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,039
PSFC is. Um so what do we need actually?

799
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,960
Well, as I said we're still quite a ways

800
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,240
like we have major technical challenges

801
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,240
because we actually go to this thing

802
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,320
which is again the design that came out.

803
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,080
How do we how do we in fact make all of

804
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,200
this work? Well, you have to have these

805
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,360
really strong and efficient

806
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,799
superconducting magnets that basically

807
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,360
check on that. And now we actually have

808
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,279
this at industrial capacity. Oh, and and

809
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,600
by the way, we see this now is that I it

810
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,159
took us uh in in the end the

811
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,640
construction of that of that test magnet

812
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,640
took about a year and now they're making

813
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,279
one of those every week in the factory

814
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,679
out in by Comusion Systems. A voila

815
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,840
industrialization and commercialization.

816
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,640
So that's kind of a check mark on that.

817
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:13,679
Uh we we are we are using machine

818
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,000
learning, quantum computing, AI out the

819
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,320
like like crazy because these are

820
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,039
complicated design and operational

821
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,120
objects, right? Uh you also have to make

822
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,200
sure that you convert the this fusion

823
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,039
energy into power and other things. So

824
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,720
we actually have this in the terms of a

825
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,640
this is this so-called blanket that

826
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,640
basically surrounds the fusion plasma.

827
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,320
And in the end, you also want to have

828
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,240
highly durable materials that can

829
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,159
actually withstand this kind of insane

830
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,760
environment. And that's actually our new

831
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,240
capability with uh at the with that. So

832
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,559
what are we accelerating progress on?

833
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,960
They said superconducting magnets. And

834
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,279
in fact, now we're working with a a a

835
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,120
company is in some sense a not not

836
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,799
necessarily competitor, but is it is a

837
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,039
different kind of topology for the

838
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,880
magnetic field. And so they have to

839
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,640
produce three-dimensional rather than

840
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,159
planer coils in this. And so we're

841
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,559
actually testing that with them right

842
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,559
now for the fusion company. Uh we're

843
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,799
designing new advanced concepts right

844
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,880
now in my class. We have a completely in

845
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,880
fact this was a uh this this this

846
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,200
actually came out of my uh design class

847
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,799
as well too uh for a different slightly

848
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,720
different mission actually of this and

849
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,360
can we continue to do that. We actually

850
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,960
have real u small versions of these

851
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,200
blankets which basically capture the

852
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,960
fusion energy. And we're also working on

853
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,120
things like uh for example additive

854
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,279
manufacturing which can really change

855
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,200
how you design uh and build some of

856
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,000
these complex objects that go inside of

857
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,760
the fusion power plant.

858
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But we also have to remember is that

859
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,880
this is like like we have still a long

860
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,279
ways to go in this right. So while we've

861
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,960
invested like order of $10 billion, it's

862
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,519
also distributed around basically

863
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,320
something like 25 different concepts. So

864
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:55,279
getting each one concept to like a power

865
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,159
plant demonstration design is minimum

866
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:00,480
probably order of $5 billion. So guess

867
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,519
what financing

868
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,240
uh is a major uh and industrial capacity

869
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,600
are two major risks actually of fusion

870
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,000
right now. Again, it's one of the

871
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,640
reasons we act Andrew Low and I started

872
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,039
uh uh Ratherford Energy Ventures was to

873
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,279
actually open up new pathways for

874
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,760
different kinds of commercial uh um

875
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,760
commercialization uh and sorry um

876
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,200
financing mechanisms around on these

877
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,440
things. Um uh we we are still at a point

878
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,519
in we're still at an infant stage about

879
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,000
how we actually while we have a really

880
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,399
good bead about how to get the cost per

881
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,799
watt down. the levelized costs are

882
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,720
highly uncertain in fusion because the

883
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,159
integrated operational environment is

884
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,559
uncertain because we just haven't done

885
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,640
it before. So if I go to in fact if I

886
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,080
look I see Charles here if we go to our

887
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,679
fision colleagues when they when they

888
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,080
introduced the first commercial fision

889
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,039
reactors they only worked at about 40 or

890
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,080
50% capacity factor because the fuel

891
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,159
rods kept failing in them and they had

892
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,679
to stop and replace them and now they

893
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,240
work at like 90%. But that took like a

894
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,000
decade or more of experience. So how are

895
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,080
we going to improve that? We're actually

896
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,240
working on that at PSFC as well too.

897
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,919
Yeah.

898
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,440
So how are we doing this? So one of them

899
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,880
is this really exciting experiment

900
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,360
called Libra which I will not go through

901
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,120
the example of this. This basically is a

902
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,880
this this thing that surrounds the

903
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,519
fusion plasma which captures the fusion

904
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,240
energy and actually converts and yes

905
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,480
fusion is an alchemy tool. It actually

906
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,360
changes the elements of the things which

907
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,720
are around it. In fact, that's one of

908
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,039
the cool things in my class that I'm

909
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,600
working on right now. Not only do we we

910
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,440
use this to actually uh recircle the cat

911
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,679
the catalytic extra neutron that comes

912
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,519
into it. We can also use these to

913
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,240
produce things really interesting

914
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,399
isotopes like gold. So it turns out you

915
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,159
can you can actually produce gold at a

916
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,600
pretty significant scale actually in a

917
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,840
fusion device. So that's one of the

918
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,279
things my students are this week. In

919
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,360
fact, tomorrow morning I'm going to get

920
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,519
an update on that result as well too. So

921
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,080
this is a real experimental capability

922
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,679
and basically is a is on the frontier of

923
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,120
science. And by the way, this is an

924
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,559
interesting one because this is like a

925
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,080
totally set of different disciplines

926
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,760
than plasmas. There's no plasmas

927
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,520
involved in this. This is integrated

928
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,760
nuclear engineering, right? So it's like

929
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,000
well yeah that's why we have we do this

930
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,679
actually at the PSFC and in fact in

931
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,599
collaboration with our u with our

932
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,200
colleagues at the nuclear reactor lab.

933
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,879
But now it is getting to the real thing

934
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,520
that is that we're actually using real

935
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,440
fusion energy products and making real

936
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,480
fusion fuel actually out of this and

937
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,040
it's critical to fusion's ability to ex

938
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,520
uh to actually to expand um once we

939
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,480
start building the first ones. Another

940
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:41,040
key one is the fact that we have very

941
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,960
little um um information about how solid

942
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,520
materials will react to these very

943
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,200
energetic particles. um and they will

944
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,679
they have to react by the laws of

945
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,280
physics. So what we've done is in fact

946
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,760
this is another interesting another one

947
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,720
that came out of a student design effort

948
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,480
about 15 years ago uh and we designed

949
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,920
this and I think Charles actually you

950
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,920
might remember this right and we looked

951
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,240
at we said yeah but this cyclron

952
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,440
technology is not available and then in

953
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:10,160
the span of 10 years the cyclron which

954
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,000
is basically compact kind of accelerator

955
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,720
became available. So what this does is

956
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
it it it basically it tricks the

957
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,359
materials into thinking it's being

958
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,400
damaged by neutrons when it's actually

959
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:22,800
being damaged by protons. Um and this is

960
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,359
uh this is funded by a very generation

961
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,079
donation from Eric Schmidt uh and his

962
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:29,520
family. Uh and we're we're reutilizing

963
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,119
the space where we had the fusion

964
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,800
experiment and now we're going to be on

965
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,400
the frontier of in fact testing

966
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,560
materials for the first time in a

967
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,920
prototypic environment for for fusion.

968
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,359
And it is in fact a private public

969
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,520
partnership because it turns out we can

970
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,760
also use this for example to assay

971
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,200
fision materials as well too and this is

972
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,960
coming online uh in about 6 months.

973
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,320
Uh a final area which is a very

974
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,440
interesting one it's it's also the

975
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,960
reason that you do fusion like can I

976
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,119
guarantee that fusion will get there?

977
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,079
I'm always ask this when Dennis when is

978
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,160
it going to come because we've heard

979
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,079
about fusion for so long right? Well,

980
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,599
the fact is we already have the SC. You

981
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,119
have to be careful about what is like a

982
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,280
good professor. You have to ask the

983
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,000
right question. What do you mean? Is it

984
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,320
here? The science of fusion is here.

985
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
We've already done it. Like we create we

986
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,359
recreate the conditions of stars on

987
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,720
Earth. We already accomplished that.

988
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,839
We've already made net energy from

989
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,079
fusion. We just on the cusp of actually

990
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,359
scient protocommercial demonstration.

991
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,119
That's what spark will do which will

992
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,880
turn on in about a year and a half. If

993
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,520
you see something making 200 million

994
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,359
watts of power and have large net energy

995
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,200
gain, yeah, of course, it's ready to

996
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,560
take that step into commercialization.

997
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,119
But those are the wrong that's actually

998
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,359
not the question. The question is, can

999
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,920
you make affordable

1000
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,400
fusion energy? So, I totally agree with

1001
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,119
Sergey on that right on that one. And it

1002
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,440
is hard. And it's hard because it's this

1003
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,040
thing that sits at the intersection of

1004
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,359
pretty much everything that you're doing

1005
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,680
is right at the edge of what you're

1006
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,200
allowed to do technologically, right? So

1007
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,119
one of the good examples of that is like

1008
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,200
how you heat the plasma and how you

1009
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,520
construct objects which are close by to

1010
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,599
the plasma. So in this case it turns out

1011
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,440
another kind of like amazing thing which

1012
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,440
also had its roots at MIT is additive

1013
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,119
manufacturing. So we have these very

1014
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,720
special microwaves that we basically

1015
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,960
launch into the plasma and they need

1016
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,960
these hollowed out kind of structures

1017
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,880
with with traditional manufacturing.

1018
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,119
They're a nightmare to make. We are now

1019
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,880
making these at spec with additive

1020
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,560
manufacturing. And in fact there's the

1021
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,920
picture of it right here being installed

1022
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,160
by my colleague Andrew. Fantastic. And

1023
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,040
guess what? There's a synergy with this

1024
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,599
because also an idea launched from the

1025
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,320
PSFC was that one of my clever

1026
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:41,839
colleagues Paul Wascov uh about 15 years

1027
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,680
ago realized that this very specialized

1028
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,320
radio frequency technology that was

1029
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,320
being used for heating the thermonuclear

1030
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,839
plasma that if you actually turned it

1031
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,520
around instead of aiming it at the

1032
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:54,240
plasma and aimed it at the earth you

1033
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,160
could start drilling holes.

1034
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,079
And what this meant was because it's a

1035
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,720
totally different physical mechanism

1036
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,720
than the mechanical drilling, this has

1037
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,119
the theoretical possibility of being

1038
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,800
able to drill holes kilometers into the

1039
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,800
earth.

1040
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,359
And what would for the reason of what

1041
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:18,839
unlocking deep hard rock so so-called

1042
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:18,839
hot hot hard hard rock geothermal

1043
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,760
and this is not just theory. That's

1044
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,960
actually holes that have been drilled in

1045
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,440
rocks at the PSFC on this. So now

1046
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,680
there's also an ongoing effort. I I

1047
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,040
can't tell the details there. There's an

1048
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,400
emerging effort about this. This is why

1049
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,720
you do things like fusion. It's just

1050
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,320
like that technology to develop that is

1051
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,920
at the right at the cusp of everything

1052
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,920
we know about superconducting magnets,

1053
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,240
RF technology. Guess what? It might have

1054
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,839
this other incredible use which is that

1055
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,839
and there's ongoing efforts and that's

1056
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,760
going to get a lot more serious. All I

1057
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,280
can say is in the next few years and if

1058
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,760
you're interested in that particular

1059
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,359
space space, you know, please contact me

1060
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,480
because there's a lot of very exciting

1061
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,079
emerging efforts in that one, right?

1062
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,440
Oh, and actually I guess they did have

1063
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,560
the slide. Oh, yeah. This is the slide I

1064
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,880
made. Yeah, there we go. um is that so

1065
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,720
what this looks like is the idea of at

1066
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,040
the PSFC have something which is

1067
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,960
basically an engineering integrated tool

1068
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,119
that starts answering these really this

1069
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,640
questions about geothermal which is we

1070
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,079
it's it's another one of these by the

1071
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,800
way which we know it's physically

1072
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,800
possible but is it economically possible

1073
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,960
and we actually have to really uh do

1074
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,880
some more work about uh properly

1075
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,880
capturing what are the requirements of

1076
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,560
this like what is the drilling rate what

1077
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,800
is the depth that you can go to what

1078
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,640
would be the durability of the holes and

1079
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,400
basically put it to the economic litmus

1080
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:42,160
test, not just the physics limus test.

1081
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,000
Um so fusion is also interesting as I as

1082
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,480
I said it's it's launched a geopolitical

1083
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,079
race. um you know there are efforts

1084
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,680
right now in the US government uh

1085
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,560
attempting to stand up private public

1086
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,920
partnerships um and a few of these but

1087
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,359
this is also um

1088
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,960
the biggest surprise in this if you

1089
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,320
would have asked me 10 years ago that I

1090
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,079
would be giving a talk that we've made

1091
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,160
the superconducting magnet that we've

1092
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,440
launched a multi-billion dollar company

1093
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,280
that we've got tens of different

1094
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,320
competitive ones and we have a bead on

1095
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,000
commercial fusion energy and a with all

1096
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,359
of that and the US government is doing

1097
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,359
nothing different than it did 10 years

1098
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,119
ago in supporting fusion is kind of

1099
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,000
amazing, right? So, please call your

1100
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,680
Congress people. This is ridiculous. Um,

1101
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,320
we're being outspent by a factor of a

1102
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,800
hundred by ch by by China in this area

1103
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,720
about commercializing fusion around in

1104
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,720
this. Yeah.

1105
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,880
And I really do want to end with and of

1106
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,880
course a hallmark of MIT is that the the

1107
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,480
way that we make this work is through

1108
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,280
our students, right? Is that um the

1109
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,200
ideas like those companies are littered

1110
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,960
with our with our graduates, right? And

1111
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,720
now we have a whole new generation of

1112
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,400
students not just working on plasma

1113
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,320
physics but on this integrated

1114
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,320
technology and they are inspiring

1115
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,680
because they they they want this to get

1116
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,880
all the way there which is all the way

1117
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,880
to commercially viable fusion right and

1118
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,920
u just say that our private research

1119
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,359
partners are significant including ENI

1120
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,720
commonwealth fusion systems one of our

1121
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,240
own spinouts type one which actually

1122
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,400
came out of University of Wisconsin but

1123
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,160
is of our colleagues bridge 12

1124
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,240
technologies which does these gyrons and

1125
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,000
many many others as well too so it's a

1126
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,839
very exciting time at the PSFC as you

1127
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,319
say we've opened our doors to pretty

1128
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,640
integrated research with industry with

1129
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,400
the energy industry and with associated

1130
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,240
technologies which are around it as well

1131
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,880
too. So what's next? So please keep your

1132
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,640
eye out for this. As I said I I I was I

1133
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,359
was not I was hoping that it would be

1134
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,200
been accept accepted yet but we've so I

1135
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:37,200
took the last year and I sat down and I

1136
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,760
took Sergey's advice and I realized I

1137
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,359
didn't know anything about economics. So

1138
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,880
I had one of the world's best e

1139
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,960
economists teach me about e e e e e e e

1140
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,520
e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e

1141
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,839
e e e e e e e e e e e e e economics,

1142
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,839
Andrew Low uh and but I know a lot about

1143
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:50,079
fusion and I sat down and I wrote a

1144
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,960
completely new framework for evaluating

1145
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:56,319
fusion economics uh in this. So this is

1146
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,839
going to be published fairly soon and u

1147
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,599
maybe in a couple years I can give the

1148
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,880
talk about that which which reveals some

1149
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,000
very interesting things and by the way

1150
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,400
Sergey you can get there.

1151
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
You can get there.

1152
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,680
I don't know if we can get there but you

1153
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,640
can get there. Yeah, actually actually

1154
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,079
right. Yep. Um, as I said, we're doing

1155
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,720
the psychotron for these materials

1156
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,280
testing. We have Libra for doing this uh

1157
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,359
for doing the fusion fuel. Um, and I'll

1158
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,200
end that with uh with machine learning

1159
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,720
because as I said, I said three things

1160
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,920
have changed, right? It was around to

1161
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,760
that. It was scientific breakthroughs.

1162
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,280
We've had true technology breakthroughs

1163
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,440
and then this is the other one that's

1164
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,280
changed it because the reasoning around

1165
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,200
fusion and the sponsorship of something

1166
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,359
like Fusion has completely changed under

1167
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,599
our feet. Nobody. And in fact, I have

1168
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:44,240
over the last two months I've been at

1169
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,839
this is probably like my sixth kind of

1170
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,520
talk or conference that is like this

1171
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,200
that is out in the real world, not not

1172
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,200
in the fusion world. And nobody's

1173
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,440
talking about climate change. It's all

1174
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,240
about the AI drive for energy that's

1175
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,079
needed. And Fusion looks like it is

1176
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,240
perfectly fit if you can meet the

1177
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,720
economic requirements around it. It is a

1178
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,800
perfect fit actually for this. And it's

1179
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,480
also a perfect fit for that kind of

1180
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,480
sponsor because I always thought

1181
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,240
eventually at some point, you know, me

1182
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,319
or one of my students would be in front

1183
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,160
of a utility executive trying to

1184
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,680
convince them to install a Fusion power

1185
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,520
plant.

1186
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,119
That's not going to be what it's like.

1187
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,760
You're going to be in front of the CEO

1188
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,800
of Google or Microsoft to convince them

1189
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,640
that what they're going to do is run

1190
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,000
their data center on a fusion one. The

1191
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,599
reason I know that because it's already

1192
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,760
happened.

1193
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,240
Yes. And those companies have made

1194
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,839
strategic decisions to that they

1195
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,160
understand that this has to be one of

1196
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:39,520
the arrows in their quivers. So instead

1197
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,520
of a very cap so this is one of the

1198
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,280
reasons I'm I'm optimistic surgey

1199
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,160
because our sponsorship has totally

1200
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,160
changed. This is not a small cap table

1201
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,640
utility considering this very risky

1202
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,880
technology. It's a technology company

1203
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,319
that literally exists because and is one

1204
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,240
of the biggest and they're all the

1205
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,560
biggest companies in the world because

1206
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:00,560
they live at the boundary of technology

1207
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,240
and economic risks. They totally get

1208
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,319
something like fusion and they have a

1209
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,800
cap table which is 100 times bigger than

1210
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,480
the utilities and that's going to be the

1211
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,800
thing and that's the third thing because

1212
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,800
it's interesting. It's the drive for

1213
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,880
fusion and its timeline and its

1214
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,720
performance and the kinds of resources

1215
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,480
that we can put towards it are going to

1216
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,640
totally change and are changing

1217
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,280
underneath our feet. We just have to

1218
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,599
keep delivering on the hard science and

1219
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,680
technology which is focused on this end

1220
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:31,800
goal of commercialization. So thank you

1221
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,800
for your attention. So

1222
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:39,440
well first of all thank you for for we

1223
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,040
ran 50 minutes over but I think it was

1224
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,720
absolutely needed because I think this

1225
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,079
is such a disrupting technology that

1226
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,640
will actually have impact in other

1227
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,160
industries we don't even know yet. So I

1228
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,000
mean there are any questions maybe take

1229
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,440
one of quick questions before we go with

1230
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,040
the network break and we can also still

1231
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,079
ask the questions we around here doing

1232
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,079
the network break if you're interested.

1233
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,119
Oh, come on. There's got to be some

1234
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:06,319
question. Sergey, you got a question.

1235
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:08,800
>> What do you think the main the first

1236
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:12,280
technical let's say difficulties you

1237
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,280
will find

1238
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,000
>> the first technical difficulty? Oh, it's

1239
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,599
it's the magnet. The mag the magnet is

1240
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,359
the the magnet is the hardest part of

1241
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,480
it. Yeah. Yeah. So that's actually why

1242
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:24,800
the focus of the company and so its

1243
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,720
ability to not only produce the magnets

1244
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,280
but also it it takes too long to explain

1245
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,319
it but the ability to test the magnets

1246
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,119
that's actually one of the things that

1247
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,720
we innovated in significantly was which

1248
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,040
you don't usually think of a university

1249
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,720
innovating in the space of manufacturing

1250
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,040
but we we understood that we actually

1251
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,599
made technology choices that allowed for

1252
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,280
extremely efficient quality control and

1253
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,520
quality assurance all the way through

1254
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,599
the manufacturing and assembly pro

1255
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,800
process. test and that is proven to be

1256
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,599
correct and that's actually why so uh so

1257
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,520
now I so we still have we like MIT has

1258
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,839
very little to do now with that because

1259
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,440
it's at the commercial scale but seeing

1260
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:03,359
that at commercial scale that you're

1261
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,720
testing that like every week basically

1262
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,720
approximately you're testing one of

1263
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,400
those and knowing that that they meet

1264
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,480
spec and that you're doing it in a

1265
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,640
scalable way that's the one and and then

1266
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,240
as usual in fusion uh you have

1267
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,400
integrated assembly and it's mostly

1268
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,599
about the magnets assembly so those are

1269
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,599
the things which are in place But it's

1270
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,520
it's it's it's progressing at at pace.

1271
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,200
If you ever get a chance, it's it's hard

1272
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,359
to get tours out there because they have

1273
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,520
so many requests for tours. It is kind

1274
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:30,160
of like breathtaking actually around

1275
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,960
that about seeing it. Yeah. About

1276
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,599
particular about how small it is, right?

1277
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,680
Okay. Super. I mean, if I can leave you

1278
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,359
with one last final note is on it. I

1279
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,040
think uh you need to get involved in

1280
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,880
fusion in fusion research on because it

1281
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,119
will affect any industry going forward

1282
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,800
on thinking really how we also going to

1283
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,160
need the education, we need the talent,

1284
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,880
we need the world actually to help us

1285
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,680
move this forward.

1286
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,920
>> So la last year we had the largest

1287
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,000
application pool, applicant pool for

1288
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,240
fusion in the history of the of the

1289
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,880
40-year history of the PSFC and we had

1290
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,560
the lowest number of admitted students

1291
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,480
because we don't have the resources to

1292
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:08,160
actually support them and we're underst

1293
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,839
staffed actually. This is I I I that's

1294
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,359
like I wake up every day and I think

1295
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:15,119
about there there was 160 qualified uh

1296
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,680
graduate students who are not working on

1297
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,240
fusion right now.

1298
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,000
Just think about that right as this is

1299
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,680
not about MIT or anything. It's like as

1300
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,319
a society like what the hell are we

1301
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,319
doing? Like that's our most important

1302
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,760
resource to unlock. We need to figure

1303
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,240
out ways to have them working

1304
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,480
meaningfully at at a pace which is 10

1305
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,960
times what we're doing. So like this

1306
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,400
institution MIT could do more around on

1307
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,839
this. By the way, I I I' I'd encourage

1308
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,440
everybody to go look at Fusion's

1309
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,839
prominent place in the climate action

1310
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:50,720
plan, by the way. Super. Thank you,

1311
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,720
Dennis. I'll be happy for you.
