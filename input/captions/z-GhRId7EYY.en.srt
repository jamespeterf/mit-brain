00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,400
Good morning everybody. Welcome to the

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,359
MPG primer. Today we're really excited

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,679
today to have Haong Tian. He's a

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,360
posttock researcher at MGH and the Broad

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,679
Institute in the lab of Perip Natarajin.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,359
He's previously completed his PhD in

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,960
bioatistics at the University of

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,600
Cambridge under the supervision of

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,680
Steven Burgess. His research focuses on

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,680
developing innovation I'm sorry

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,720
innovative causal inference methods

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,800
particularly for mandelian randomization

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,880
and applying them to address real world

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,320
biomedical questions. He has broad

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,120
interest broad interest in the interface

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,640
of statistics epidemiology and genetics.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,840
Um and we're happy to have him here

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,840
today and again ask questions

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,120
throughout. Thank you. Take it away.

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,800
>> Thank you. Okay. Thank you everyone. Um

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,039
so today let's talk about mundane

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,280
randomization. So our story starts with

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,600
the a very important question that is

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,840
the causal inference question. So we are

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,160
not familiar with the general inference

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,480
that is about the association between X

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,640
and uh sorry the exposure X and the

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,840
outcome Y. So in other words, this is

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,560
the probability of the Y given the

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,560
observed exposure X value. But the cause

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,960
of influence is kind of different or

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,640
essentially we can say totally different

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,560
that is about the probability of Y after

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,159
we change the exposure. So that is about

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,240
uh the change of exposure not the

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,280
observed exposure. In other words, when

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,920
we say there exist the cause effect of

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,400
exposure on the outcome, it means that

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,680
if we change the exposure, we outcome

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,000
will be changed accordingly.

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,720
So causal influence is very important

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,280
and very natural questions in many

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,119
scenarios. So the the essential idea is

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,240
that the cause of influence will give

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,560
you the motivation to give interventions

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,240
on the exposure in order to improve your

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,759
outcome. So that's the essential ideas

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,920
but this is difficult. I remember when I

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,079
first took the course of simple linear

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,320
regression at that time I really wish

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,280
that the fitted parameter of the

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,360
regression have the cause of

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,400
interpretation but obviously I was

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,160
wrong. The reason is that the regression

55
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,239
or the simple linear regression

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,959
essentially is about the association but

57
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,680
association between the X and Y doesn't

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,319
mean that there exist cause effect of X

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,959
on Y in the sense that you change X your

60
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,800
outcome will not changed. So in other

61
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,599
words if you use the graphical language

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,120
it means that there's no arrows from X

63
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,239
to Y. So there are many examples that

64
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,000
can illustrate that XY are associated

65
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,599
but doesn't mean that it's causal

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,239
relationship. So the most famous example

67
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,040
is the confounding structure. So the

68
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,440
confounders here refers to the variable

69
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,560
that can affect your exposure and

70
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,120
outcome jointly. So that you can observe

71
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,319
that X and Y associated but it doesn't

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,800
mean that is causal effect.

73
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,720
So that's why we need the causal

74
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,440
influence methods beyond the general

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,360
influence methods.

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,440
So there are many important cause

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,200
influence methods and I think the most

78
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,280
reliable and convincing examples is the

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,599
uh based on the experimental data. So

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,920
we're no familiar with this because RCD

81
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,080
is very good and we like RCD because it

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,760
do a perfect randomization. It can have

83
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,200
the very good cause interpolation is

84
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,599
very intuitive but it is expensive and

85
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,280
sometimes is not plausible. That's why

86
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,360
in the past 20 years the main

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,159
development of coal influence methods is

88
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,319
based on the observational data only. We

89
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,840
have lots of causal impulence methods

90
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,440
now and uh they are using different

91
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,440
models different strategies with

92
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,640
different assumptions to identify the

93
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,799
causal effect of interest and among them

94
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,599
there is one methods called instrumental

95
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,080
variable analysis methods. So what is

96
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,920
instrumental analysis? It's just a

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,239
simple method but that can help you to

98
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,920
answer the causal questions using

99
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,680
observational data only. And uh the main

100
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,799
features of the instrumental valve

101
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,840
analysis that it does not requires any

102
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,799
model assumptions about the confounders.

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,759
In other words, even you don't know or

104
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,360
doesn't realize that the existence of

105
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,000
the combounders, you can still use the

106
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,919
instrumental web analysis.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,720
So this is the main reason that why it

108
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,040
becomes so popular in many fields and

109
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,440
particularly if you do uh many

110
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,759
statistics work in epidemiology and

111
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,479
genetics analysis. You will encounter

112
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,680
the instrumental web analysis very often

113
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,960
and the main advantage is not only that

114
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,960
it does not require the existence of the

115
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,680
sorry the measure of the compounders it

116
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,639
also gives you very flexible models. So

117
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,479
in other words you can have more choices

118
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,479
than the model not only modeling the

119
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,560
phenotype distribution but also the

120
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,080
distribution of genetic association.

121
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,080
This is particularly important point I

122
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,560
want to highlight today because we are

123
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,840
do many analysis in epidemiology and

124
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,880
genetics and usually in many cases you

125
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,039
will find that the epidemiology analysis

126
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,080
is more sensitive than the genetics

127
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,919
analysis. So the reason is because that

128
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,000
epidemology analysis based on

129
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,000
distribution of the phenotype but the

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,919
genetics analysis sometimes are based on

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,960
the distribution of genetic association

132
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,120
which is more reliable and stable. So

133
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,800
instrumental variable can be based on

134
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,680
the distribution of genetic association

135
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,759
that is very popular in genetics.

136
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,360
So right what is MR? So technically

137
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,960
speaking MR is nothing but just

138
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,840
instrumental web analysis. So if you are

139
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,600
interested in the MR you can start to

140
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,120
learn the MR and also you can start to

141
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
learn the instrumental variable because

142
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,520
every concepts and every problems and

143
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,000
every points in instrumental analysis is

144
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,919
also the points in mandization but the

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
key difference that mundane

146
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,479
randomization use the genetic variance

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,240
as the instrument which is quite

148
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,880
different uh to another uh other

149
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,520
instrumental variable methods. So we

150
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,759
will immediately realize that why MI is

151
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,600
so different because it use the

152
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,160
properties of genetic variance and it

153
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,680
will make

154
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,000
>> sorry I have a question.

155
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,520
>> What do you mean by the four four

156
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,880
analysis? MR is a four. What is the

157
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,960
analysis method mean?

158
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,039
>> M it says MR is a four analysis method.

159
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,800
Oh Ivy sorry is

160
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:41,919
>> this is in short uh stands for the

161
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,639
instrumental analysis. Um

162
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,400
all right so so technically speaking MI

163
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,400
is just instrumental web analysis

164
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,080
methods and we'll start to first

165
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,240
introduce the instrumental web analysis

166
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,720
and then move to the why genetic

167
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,160
variance can be used as the instrument.

168
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,840
So when we talk about the causal

169
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,919
influence methods including instrumental

170
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,520
verb analysis assumptions are very

171
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,680
important concept because this because

172
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,840
in causal influence no assumptions no

173
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,440
causal influence that's why we really

174
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,599
highlight the importance of the

175
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,440
assumptions and uh so in for

176
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,599
instrumental variable analysis there are

177
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,520
three important assumptions

178
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,680
and uh this my perhaps my personal step

179
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,919
before I introduce the assumptions I

180
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,599
prefer to introduce the purpose of the

181
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,280
assumptions because based on different

182
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,440
assumptions you achieve different

183
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:32,720
purpose. So today our purpose is just

184
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,120
only one that is we just want to test a

185
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,360
test a n hypothesis. This n hypothesis

186
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,759
called sharp nypsis which means that

187
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,440
there's no unosal effect in any way over

188
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,360
any time. So this is very strong

189
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,479
statement but you will quickly

190
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,479
understand why I can only test this n

191
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,639
because I only made three assumptions.

192
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,479
So

193
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,479
how do we um introduce the assumptions

194
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,720
in co of inference? There are many

195
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,400
different languages to describe

196
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,639
assumptions. Usually there are three

197
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,800
languages

198
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,720
and uh at least all of them. So

199
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,720
in the very beginning let's assume that

200
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,400
there's no I didn't make assumption. I

201
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,280
just want to emphasize that we can write

202
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,599
down the outcomes expressed by the

203
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,160
explosion and other variables. So this

204
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,240
is the first uh equation I want to start

205
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,400
in at this stage I didn't make any

206
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
assumption I just uh write down the

207
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,000
equation. This equation refers to

208
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,519
structure equation which represents the

209
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,279
belief of how the data are generated.

210
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,760
So here the the kept U refers to the any

211
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:43,200
variables that it will be related to the

212
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,680
outcome but we just cannot observe that

213
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,760
we cannot realize that

214
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,839
and the parameter beta refers to the

215
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,320
causive value we really want to test

216
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:56,240
because under the N hypothes really want

217
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,680
to test if not the beta equals to zero.

218
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,959
So we write down the expressions and now

219
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,760
interesting if we assume

220
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,480
there exist an additional variable. So

221
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:13,240
this variable is actually uh like the

222
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,240
genetic variant and this variable

223
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,959
once we have this variable we can

224
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,600
updated the graph and the equation like

225
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,600
in this way again at this stage I didn't

226
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,519
make any assumption because I can always

227
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,399
write equation like this way using the

228
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,959
algebra language. So now we will start

229
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,480
to make assumptions. So the capital G is

230
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,399
the instrument and the first assumption

231
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,000
is that I assume that the G that is the

232
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,200
instrument is correlated with the

233
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,160
exposure. And then if I additionally

234
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,200
assumes that the instrument is

235
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,560
independent of the confounders

236
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,080
and the third assumption is that I

237
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,480
assume that the instrument cannot affect

238
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,920
outcome directly. Once we make these

239
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,560
three assumptions, we say that the

240
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,720
instrument G here is the valid

241
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,120
instrument. So this is typically the

242
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,360
three assumptions for the instrumental

243
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,240
web analysis.

244
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,080
Once we have this valid instrument,

245
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,240
we can immediately write down a very

246
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,079
famous equation instrument analysis.

247
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,160
That is to say the genetic association

248
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,240
with outcome is just proportional to the

249
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,160
genetic association with exposure in the

250
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,120
size of beta. So the beta is the

251
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,120
parameter we want to test.

252
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,160
So

253
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,000
the left hand side is genetic

254
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,720
association exposure. The right hand

255
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,160
side is genetic association with the

256
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,000
outcome. So we can use the any statistic

257
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,079
methods to make inference because they

258
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,920
are identifiable in statistics. So we

259
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,399
can immediately know what the beta looks

260
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,760
like. So remember that we are testing

261
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,720
the sharp hypothesis. So we wish to find

262
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,160
the evidence to

263
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,600
distinguish the betas from zero. So once

264
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,000
we found such evidence we can say that

265
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,680
uh there exist a causal effect which

266
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,120
means that the beta not equals zero.

267
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,440
So this is typical idea. So as you may

268
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,440
know that we here made a very strong

269
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,279
statement. So when we reject the sharp

270
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,760
non hypothesis which means that we can

271
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,720
say that there exist cause bad but we

272
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,360
have no idea what this effect looks like

273
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,399
we don't know if or not the so-called

274
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,200
causal effects only

275
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,920
to certain subgroup or certain exposure

276
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,519
level and this is a trade-off this is

277
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,440
because

278
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,200
we only made three assumption because I

279
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,519
don't want my today's presentation too

280
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,839
complicated so in cost of influence if

281
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,120
you make less

282
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,079
assumptions you will only be able to

283
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,040
test very strong non hypothesis. So this

284
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,120
is trade off. If we want to answers more

285
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,120
precise cause of effect for example the

286
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,920
cause of effect for a certain subgroup

287
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,560
we must made more assumptions but once

288
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,040
we made more assumptions sometimes these

289
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,720
assumptions are unverifiable. So which

290
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,760
means that they may be unreliable they

291
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,399
may be related in realistic so we will

292
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,800
end up with unreliable results. So this

293
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,480
is a trade-off and uh so this is the

294
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,200
first point I want to highlight today is

295
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,000
that today we are only care about sharp

296
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,160
hypothesis. We do not want to do the

297
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
other things beyond the sharp null

298
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,760
hypothesis because we only made three

299
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,760
assumptions and uh in most I think in

300
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,279
all causal influence methods assumptions

301
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,200
are very important. Um if you want to

302
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,600
test the weak hypothesis or you want to

303
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,560
do estimation you must assume additional

304
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,920
assumptions. So there is a very famous

305
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:45,040
paper uh published in nearly 20 years

306
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,320
ago in chronometric. So that paper made

307
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,360
additional assumption which is quite

308
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,040
reliable and using that additional

309
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,880
assumption they can identify very

310
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,240
interesting cause of effect which is

311
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,880
deformed to a subgroup of the

312
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,160
population. So that's is the if you are

313
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,200
interested you can look at this paper

314
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,920
and uh that paper is actually ill this

315
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,800
idea in a very good way and this idea is

316
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,399
also the key uh contribution behind the

317
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,760
2021 no price economics so overall this

318
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,480
is about my today's work we wish to use

319
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,120
the IB3 assumptions to test the sharpen

320
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,480
hypothesis

321
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,320
so here uh I just give some examples of

322
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,480
instrumental variable analysis so the

323
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,200
key idea of instrumental relevance just

324
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,600
to form the validate

325
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,720
um instrument that satisfied all the

326
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,040
three IV assumptions

327
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,880
and typically all the scenarios you can

328
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,600
see that the instrumental variable is

329
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,480
kind of good which means that we believe

330
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,360
that they indeed somehow are well

331
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,120
randomized. So randomization

332
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,120
uh is very beautiful word in causal

333
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,959
influence because like the RCT it give

334
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,240
us the chance to do the causal influence

335
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,320
and uh in recent years they are someone

336
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,240
proposing to use the genetic

337
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,480
informations as the instrumental

338
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,600
variable to do the causal inference. So

339
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,480
because they think the genetic

340
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,000
information are well randomized. So in

341
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,079
other words they believe there exist

342
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,639
some randomization in a mandelian way.

343
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,320
So they call it mundane randomization.

344
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,839
So we're back to mundane randomization.

345
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,884
We already know the instrumental

346
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,440
variable analysis and with the three

347
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:33,120
[clears throat] assumptions to test the

348
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,880
sharp non hypothesis and now we have the

349
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,639
genetic information. So we are really

350
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,760
interesting to know if not we can use

351
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,920
the genetic variance to do the uh cause

352
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,760
inference under the instrumental verb

353
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,720
framework.

354
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:50,000
So can we do that? Um actually I don't

355
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,199
know nobody can tell you the answer but

356
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,800
this is our belief that many people

357
00:14:53,199 --> 00:15:00,240
think genetic varants are kind of good

358
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,040
randomized. Uh so I want to highlight

359
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,360
that this sentence is the belief not the

360
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,279
conclusion and and indeed there are many

361
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,519
people disagree with the amount

362
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,399
randomization but today I want to

363
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,320
illustrate this point. Um it really

364
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,720
depends on the if or not you really

365
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,040
really believe the genetic variants are

366
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,600
indeed randomized because if genetic

367
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,000
variants are indeed randomized we indeed

368
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,120
can use the instrumental verb analysis

369
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,079
logic to do the causal inference.

370
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,399
So I think there are many good logic

371
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:38,480
behind the MR. So the key philosophy is

372
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:41,519
that if if we look at the family level

373
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,920
so the mandala loss I think ensures that

374
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,040
the distribution of the next

375
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,279
generation's genetic factors are indeed

376
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,000
kind of independent so which means that

377
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,399
they are well randomized but most times

378
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,759
MR was contacted in the population

379
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,240
level. So in the population level there

380
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,040
are many ways to think about mundane

381
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,079
randomization assumptions and I think

382
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,560
random mating is the one logic to help

383
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:12,639
you to invalidate if not the genetic

384
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,480
varian are indeed randomized or not. Um

385
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,720
but again I want to highlight that this

386
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,800
is just one way to illustrate that

387
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,560
because nobody can really illustrate if

388
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,480
not the genative varants are indeed

389
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,199
randomized and the strict speaking also

390
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,920
the random man is not always correct in

391
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,839
practice but again I just say that

392
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,000
usually we're happy to believe that

393
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,120
genetic varants are randomized in the

394
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,880
sense that is typically independent of

395
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,800
the environmental factors because the

396
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,560
environmental factors will serve as the

397
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,199
confounders in our instrumental web

398
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,800
analysis framework.

399
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,720
this first point. The second point is

400
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,800
that um we already used the G was to

401
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,560
identify the money genetic variant that

402
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,320
associated with the exposure of

403
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,199
interest. So which is good because

404
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,759
remember that the first I assumption u

405
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,600
indicated that the the instrument should

406
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,839
be correlated with the exposure and this

407
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,319
is the truth because we already used G

408
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,160
was to form that there's indeed mining

409
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,839
genetic variance associated with the

410
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,640
exposures

411
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,880
so which is good and uh also from the

412
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,720
statistical perspective

413
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,520
um since we have found money independent

414
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,120
snips we can do lots of status works

415
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,039
like the meta analysis to borrow

416
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,520
information. That is to say, for

417
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,679
example, we have 10 genetic variants.

418
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,280
For each one of them, we can do the M

419
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,600
estimation and get the so-called uh

420
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,799
causal effect estimates and we can

421
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:43,200
easily combine them together to have the

422
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:46,960
more um narrow confidence intervals or

423
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:50,640
more confident uh causal conclusions.

424
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,360
This is the very flexible idea um in

425
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,039
terms of the meta analysis for I uh for

426
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,960
instrumental variable analysis

427
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,280
estimation and also since we have the

428
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,559
mutable instrumental variables we can

429
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,640
also have the chance to do many robust

430
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,440
amas and we will return to this point

431
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,880
later. So which is good because if you

432
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,120
really look at the other instrumental we

433
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,760
analysis examples they only have one

434
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,360
instrument but in genetics in MR

435
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,919
scenarios we can have mutable

436
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,039
instrumental variable. So we can have

437
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,919
much space to take advantage of such

438
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:29,039
mutable instrument

439
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,799
available to us. So this is about second

440
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,720
point and the third point is also very

441
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,440
important. This is also the truth not

442
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,760
the belief is that genetic variants are

443
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,880
usually fixed at birth which means that

444
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,559
if we happy to believe that genetic

445
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,039
variance as the instrument. So the

446
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,960
instrument is very fixed at the very

447
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,919
beginning. It was not influenced by the

448
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:54,080
later age phenotypes.

449
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:56,960
So it will give you a quite stable

450
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,520
belief about that your instrument is

451
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,400
very good is very fixed. So if you are

452
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,840
happy with the first point here and the

453
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,440
plus the third point here I think you

454
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,919
should be very excited about the

455
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,440
maintenization as the instrumental web

456
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,480
analysis because it gives a very good

457
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,880
belief to see to believe that the

458
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,039
instrumental web assumptions are well

459
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,000
satisfied.

460
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,760
So this is about the aological point and

461
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,520
also I want to highlight some important

462
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:31,919
things from statistics. So I I really

463
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,919
show that the really important equation

464
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,679
of instrumental variable is like this.

465
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,440
So the genetic association with outcome

466
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,039
is proportional to the genetic

467
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,640
association with the exposure. So if we

468
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:47,440
look into this equation you can see that

469
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,400
we actually no need to calculate it the

470
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,559
genetic associations with the phenotypes

471
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,320
by uh using the individual level data

472
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,799
because J was really done this for us

473
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,799
and also you can see that these two

474
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,520
genetic association are separated in the

475
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,000
equation which means that we even don't

476
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,919
need to do the estimation using the one

477
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
symbol we actually can finish it the

478
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,160
estimation using the two different

479
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,400
datas. So which means that we can use in

480
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,360
the two sample analysis.

481
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,120
So this give the m quite flexible than

482
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,200
other instrumental variable analysis

483
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,200
methods.

484
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,320
So here this number is that so-called

485
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,480
the two sample summary data mundization

486
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:33,360
methods which I think the majority MR

487
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,600
methods for the published work in the

488
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,960
recent years and uh I want to

489
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:43,360
highlighted one point here is that

490
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:46,159
the two sample summary data MI is very

491
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,640
uh popularized because the convenience

492
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,799
of data but not because this methods

493
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,559
itself is more reliable because this

494
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,360
just because it's more convenient that

495
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:58,559
everyone can use the uh publish some

496
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,799
data and quickly to do the M estimation.

497
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,880
So that's why you can see if you look

498
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:07,039
the many published Emma papers typically

499
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,200
they are about to s some related MR

500
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,039
right and another in the end point I

501
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
want to highlight is that because we are

502
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,080
the community of genetics when we do the

503
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,679
Emma uh we can do lots of things beyond

504
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,600
the traditional instrumental web

505
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,919
analysis this is because that we use

506
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,080
genetic variant as the instrument so if

507
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,720
we look at the genetic variance we can

508
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,240
do a lot of things using the different

509
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,760
genetic techniques

510
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,240
And uh uh for example we have very good

511
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:37,200
data sources from GW was and chos and if

512
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,440
you wish to take the U exposure as the

513
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,480
protein or expression level you can also

514
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,440
use many QTL and PQTL and also we can do

515
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,679
lots of works like FS like variance

516
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,159
clustering there school genetic

517
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,320
correlations. So all these methods can

518
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,960
help you to improve the reliability of

519
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,360
your MR analysis. So that is today if

520
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,200
you do Emma you can of course do lots of

521
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,000
instrumental web analysis uh methods uh

522
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,799
and also you can do lots of another

523
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,640
genetics techniques analysis

524
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,720
right this is all about about all the

525
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:16,480
things and more motivations for the MR

526
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,720
but do we really think the MI is good

527
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,760
instrument web analysis methods and my

528
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,600
answer is perhaps yes or no remember

529
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,760
that if We treat the MR as the

530
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,919
instrumental verb analysis methods and

531
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,720
everything is about three assumptions of

532
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,440
instrumental web analysis.

533
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,280
But even we already know that there are

534
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,919
many good properties of genetic

535
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,960
variance. We still face many challenges

536
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:47,080
in terms of the violation of the IV

537
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,080
analysis method.

538
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,440
So the first point is that the genetic

539
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,600
association with the exposure is

540
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,559
actually not quite strong as you

541
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,200
expected. So which means that even we

542
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,280
formed that there is some evidence from

543
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,159
the statistics that the genetic

544
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,080
instrument is correlated with your

545
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,080
exposure. It doesn't mean that your

546
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,919
first IV assumption is really satisfied.

547
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,440
So this is this is not a logical

548
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,320
problem. This is about statistic

549
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,720
problem. So,

550
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,799
so because you estimated genetic

551
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,360
association with the exposure is the

552
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,280
estimate. So, you must take into account

553
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,480
the uncertainties

554
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:33,280
for you in violation of IV strength. So,

555
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:38,159
there is very there's very famous and

556
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,640
well established metric to measure the

557
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,480
uh I strength that is called F

558
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,880
statistic. So that is to say once you

559
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,520
have determined sorry once you have

560
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,600
decided you instrument exposure you can

561
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,679
quickly calculate the F statistic if the

562
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,039
F statistics is less than 10 which means

563
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,000
that you will suffer from the weak

564
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:59,200
instrument bas so what's the consequence

565
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,159
of the weak instrument I uh issues is

566
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,080
that if you are using the one sle MR you

567
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,240
typically have inflated type one error

568
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,480
this is very horrible because remember

569
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,200
that what's the purpose of Emma and I

570
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,360
analysis the purpose is just to testing

571
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,400
So you will when you get a meaningful

572
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,720
conclusion you typically want to reject

573
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,520
your null hypothesis but if if you

574
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,080
cannot control your type one error you

575
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,799
conclusion that rejects no hypothesis

576
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:31,440
will not be reliable that's why we

577
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:34,720
really care about the f status value

578
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:37,600
because it determines if not we suffer

579
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,960
from the weak IV issues particularly if

580
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,919
we are doing the one sample MR

581
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,480
If the f star value is slower than 10

582
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,120
this is very dangerous which means that

583
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,520
you any conclusion you get will be

584
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,080
unreliable. So that's why we need to

585
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,520
check f statistics in i analysis

586
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,240
including mundane randomization

587
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,360
analysis. So this about the first

588
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,679
assumption and uh

589
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,679
about the second and the third I

590
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,640
assumption unfortunately I would say

591
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:14,880
that is typically are not quite um

592
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,840
satisfied in realistic. So here I just

593
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,440
uh pick the eight examples to illustrate

594
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:25,039
that the genetic variance can still

595
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,200
violate the IV assumptions uh in many

596
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,360
different scenarios which means that

597
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,799
even the truth is that there's no causal

598
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:36,240
effect of X on Y you can still find that

599
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:39,120
your genetic variance to be correlated

600
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,640
with your outcome. So that is to the you

601
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:46,279
will you could end up with the false

602
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,279
positive conclusion.

603
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,960
So here so this is very dangerous but we

604
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:57,120
cannot solve all the scenarios and um

605
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,400
so the only things we can do is that we

606
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,760
try different strategies to invalidate

607
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:07,200
these assumptions and we try our best to

608
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:10,000
improve the quality of the MR analysis.

609
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,320
So here I just give the some my

610
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,360
suggestions to improve the MR analysis

611
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,840
because we we cannot assume that genetic

612
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,679
variance are very perfect instrument in

613
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,760
the sense that typically in many

614
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,159
scenarios the I assumption will be

615
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,400
wellated for the instrument we used for

616
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,880
the cause of influence.

617
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,200
So I randomly pick some suggestion here.

618
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,600
So I think maybe we should be really

619
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,400
clear about explosion definition. So

620
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,360
this this suggestion can doesn't

621
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,400
actually change the MR calculation but

622
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,480
instead is a good habit at least to me

623
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,720
is a very good habit to be first very

624
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,799
clear about exposure definition because

625
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,360
in many scenarios

626
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:56,320
um the MRI exposure is not the true

627
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,919
exposure but actually the biomarker of

628
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,919
the exposure.

629
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:04,400
That is to say you many times we are in

630
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,880
we do the MR analysis based on the

631
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,400
biomarkers or the downstream variables

632
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,960
of the lengthened exposure. So in this

633
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,240
case you can still do the M analysis but

634
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,039
you should be really care about the

635
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,360
interpretation.

636
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,159
So that is why when we get the

637
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,799
conclusion using Emma, I suggest to use

638
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:28,320
the sentence like the genetically

639
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:31,120
predicted exposure is associated with

640
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,720
outcome instead of to say there exist

641
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,640
cause effect of the exposure on the

642
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,440
outcome because sometimes the exposure

643
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,840
is not the true exposure you can image.

644
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,320
So the exposure sometimes are only the

645
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,200
biomeac of the lengthened exposure of

646
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,039
interest. So this is example about why I

647
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,960
encourage should be very clear about

648
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,559
exposure to vision and there are also

649
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,279
some suggestions. So for example if you

650
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,480
u for example if you exposure of

651
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:01,200
interest is the LDL.

652
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,720
So for the LDL we know that there are

653
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,559
many biological confirmed

654
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,559
pathway

655
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:14,799
for the uh generation of LDL. So you can

656
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,679
use the specific power knowledge to

657
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,919
choose the genetic variance that is you

658
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,880
don't need to use that way to choose

659
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,120
genetic variance. You can just pick the

660
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,440
gene regions that most associated with

661
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,440
the LDLC. So this will increase the

662
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,919
reliability of your genetic variant

663
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,760
because in the sense you will truly

664
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,240
believe that genetic varants are

665
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,799
associated with the exposure of interest

666
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:43,600
and there is a low risk of the wellating

667
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:47,360
the third and the second IV assumptions

668
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,679
and also you can do uh another check. So

669
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,240
for example most scenarios we do Emma

670
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,120
based on the publish summary data. So

671
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,159
one suggestion could be that uh think

672
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,559
about how the sum data were generated

673
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,640
because there are some scenarios that

674
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,840
the G was

675
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,399
used in um different way than you

676
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,279
expect. For example, they use the PMI

677
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,960
adjusted exposure. In this case we know

678
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:17,679
that from the GS if we adjust the BMI so

679
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,399
you uh some data could be not quite

680
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,120
reliable. So it will make you some

681
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,679
genetic variance to be well related

682
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,399
sorry will be unreliable and invalid in

683
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,320
the sense that it will violated some IV

684
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,720
assumptions. So that is also the good

685
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,640
habit and we also have some suggestions

686
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,919
is to do uh the robust MR methods. So

687
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,679
robust MR methods were typically

688
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,240
uh

689
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:46,240
options that everyone can use in

690
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,240
practice because everyone typically can

691
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,159
use robust MIR method. So my next slide

692
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,480
is where I'll be introduce some robust

693
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,440
MR methods. But before I move to the

694
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,640
next I want to emphasize one things is

695
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,320
that uh robust MR method is just one way

696
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,159
to improve the quality of our MES. So

697
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,559
because I don't want to give you the

698
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,440
impression that robust MI is the major

699
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,000
things and sometimes uh robos MRI

700
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,880
methods cannot help you but it's just

701
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,120
because that we can do the robos nearly

702
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,360
all scenarios. That's why I have to

703
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,200
introduce them.

704
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,200
But you can say there are many another

705
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,720
strategies you can consider but not only

706
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,520
limited to robust MR methods.

707
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,120
Right?

708
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,720
So what is the robust MR methods?

709
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,039
Robbert

710
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,679
methods refers to all the methods that

711
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,640
can help you get reliable causal

712
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,520
convolution even some or all I sum are

713
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,399
violated because we know that the in the

714
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,120
MR the I assumption can be easily viated

715
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,480
so that's why we need sometimes we need

716
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,000
the robust MR methods so the robust MR

717
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,480
method is based on the assumption

718
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,640
exchangeability which means that they

719
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,080
proposed the new additional assumption

720
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,399
to exchange the original IV assumption.

721
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,159
So even your original I assumption is

722
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:10,960
vated but you use the robust methods you

723
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,360
can still get validate conclusion.

724
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,720
That's the key idea. So it use different

725
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:20,000
strategies. Usually uh I think they can

726
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,440
be uh divided to two groups. One group

727
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,360
is based on the uh snips removal

728
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,760
strategies. Another group is based on

729
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,640
the model based group.

730
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,480
So I give you quick examples. So the MR

731
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,799
model is a very simple method which

732
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,960
means that when you made additional

733
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:40,720
assumption that you believe the majority

734
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:44,480
of the genetic variance that generate

735
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,200
the consistent or similar IV estimates

736
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,799
they are the valid instruments. So this

737
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,279
is the assumption under this assumption

738
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,159
you can quickly immediately identify the

739
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:57,360
true cause effect uh according to the

740
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:01,360
cluster of the genetic variance.

741
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:04,000
uh another methods is called the MAPSS.

742
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,200
So this is the compilatively statistical

743
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,080
based uh and the model based methods. So

744
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,159
instead they directly use the algebra

745
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,159
language to describe

746
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,159
uh the distribution of the genetic

747
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:20,240
association with the exposure and the

748
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:23,440
outcome and then here they they use the

749
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,840
different assumptions based on the

750
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,279
statistic model and then make influence

751
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,840
to get the true causal parameters. So

752
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,240
this is a very model based methods. Here

753
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,399
I introduce this methods is not because

754
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,880
this is good method but actually it take

755
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,840
the advantage of the ALD score. So AD

756
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,000
school is method to describe the genetic

757
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,399
correlation of your exposure and

758
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,360
outcome. So it also score is also based

759
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:51,679
on assumptions. So MIAPS is just use

760
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:56,320
very similar assumptions behind the AD

761
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:58,399
score to conduct robust uh I analysis

762
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,080
estimation.

763
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:05,840
So we have so many robust MIR methods.

764
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:09,919
So can we choose the best methods out of

765
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,880
these candidates and my answer is no. Uh

766
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:16,320
uh never never never do the selections

767
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,960
on the robust MR methods. Um so the the

768
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,919
idea is that as a side the robust MR

769
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,240
methods is to propose the new additional

770
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,640
assumption to exchange the original I

771
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,039
assumption. Different methods will use

772
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,799
different ways to propose the additional

773
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,640
assumption. You never know which

774
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,039
additional assumption are more reliable

775
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,399
in your scenarios because most times the

776
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:39,120
coal inference assumptions are

777
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,360
unverifiable which means that nobody can

778
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,519
tell you they are really true. So in

779
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,080
practice the general way is used more

780
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:49,039
like the triangulation strategies that

781
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,760
is to say you should try multiple

782
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,760
different robust MR methods and you can

783
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,320
say if or not they are really

784
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,080
consistent.

785
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:02,880
So if we if you we use many different

786
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,120
robust MR methods based on different

787
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,600
additional assumptions

788
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,200
if we don't get the your conclusion is

789
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,119
quite consistent which is good because

790
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,679
they will increase the reliability of

791
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:18,079
your conclusion but sometimes we may end

792
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:21,119
up with quite different uh

793
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:24,399
results using different robos MR method

794
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:27,839
but it's okay in this case don't be uh

795
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,399
frustrated just report results and this

796
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,119
will mot the future studies to think

797
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,879
about why in some scenarios that you

798
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,639
results are quite different using

799
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:43,359
certain robust amma methods and it will

800
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:46,159
improve our understanding on the on new

801
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:49,200
real uh application scenario. So this is

802
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:53,440
the key ideas I want to say that

803
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,919
right. So this is about robos and um

804
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,839
here I just give the pipeline um so

805
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:01,040
actually I'm the really anti pipeline

806
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,040
presence um I have really mixed feelings

807
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,680
about the proposed pipeline for the

808
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,839
comments. The reason is that on the one

809
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,760
hand pipeline auto procedure is good

810
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,160
because it can help us to get rid of

811
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,240
some uh big mistakes but on the other

812
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,320
hand it will give you the false

813
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:22,160
impression that your M is good because

814
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,240
when we do do the M when when we finish

815
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,640
all the checklist and we do all the

816
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,640
correct things uh we will tend to

817
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,880
believe that our MR conclusion is

818
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:35,520
relable but actually not um the MR

819
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,440
conclusion really based bas on the uh

820
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,040
designs but not from the calculations.

821
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,680
So even you do all the calculation that

822
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,079
mean that your MR results are reliable

823
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,640
in the end. But here but generally

824
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,640
speaking when we do MR analysis

825
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,280
everything is just based on the question

826
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,640
and your data. So you can have data and

827
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,839
then have question you can also have

828
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,800
first have the question and data.

829
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,200
Usually I would suggest to first have

830
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,760
the question because the question will

831
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,000
make you think about if not you are

832
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,680
doing the right design you are really

833
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,599
answer the question instead of just do

834
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,760
the calculation based on the data. So

835
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,760
there are many ways to start the

836
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,480
analysis. So if you are doing the

837
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,640
epidemology analysis is it's very okay

838
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,640
to directly say that okay we are

839
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,560
interested to the cause effect of your

840
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,640
exposure and your outcome. This is very

841
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,560
good motivation. And if you do genetic

842
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,160
variance for example you have you would

843
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,240
think about the mining mutual protein

844
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,640
candidate you are interesting to know

845
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,800
which or how many proteins are

846
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,720
correlated or have the cause of

847
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,760
connection to exposure. You can also

848
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,280
package it as the mundaneization

849
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,280
question that is so that you can focus

850
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,440
on each single protein and think about

851
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,960
and do the MR for the each single

852
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,960
protein because single protein can be

853
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,400
served as the exposure and your outcome

854
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,599
will be served as outcome in the

855
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,000
instrument framework and also sometimes

856
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,800
you may have two phenotypes

857
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,640
and you cannot distinguish the cause of

858
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,520
direction of the phenotypes. So you can

859
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,079
also do the MR. So in the way that you

860
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,400
do the first Emma using the first

861
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,560
phenotype exposure and then do the

862
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,960
second Emma using the second phenotype

863
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,440
as exposure. So I just do two Emma

864
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,920
separately. So this is all thing is very

865
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,960
flexible. You can you can very flexible

866
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,560
to the MR analysis in any way you wish

867
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,079
as long as you can describe the question

868
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,760
as the uh co investigate the cause of X

869
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,839
or Y.

870
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,359
So the most important things later is

871
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,640
about the snip selection. Snip

872
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,760
establishment is typically the most

873
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:41,440
important part in MR analysis. Uh there

874
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:45,040
are many uh strategies I proposed here.

875
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,000
Um again once you have selective snips

876
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,000
you can do the MR uh calculation which

877
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,800
is very simple and straightforward and

878
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,640
packages can do it very quickly

879
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,880
and then I think more important thing is

880
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,280
to the sensitivity analysis. So you can

881
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,320
do a lots of sensitive analysis for

882
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:06,160
example uh using different robos methods

883
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:10,400
and based on different data cohort and

884
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,640
uh using different uh genetic variance

885
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,200
because in ML you typically have many

886
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,280
genetic variants can be used for the IV

887
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,280
estimation and then you can also do

888
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,359
positive contra negative control. So

889
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,960
these things will help you make your

890
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,200
Emma results is more informative and in

891
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,760
the end more reliable.

892
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,760
So that is about the conventional assa

893
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,359
pipeline.

894
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,440
So let's um give a quick summary. So

895
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,760
original MR essentially just

896
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,240
instrumental web analysis methods. So

897
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,440
technically speaking uh everything in

898
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,000
every analysis also uh applicable to the

899
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,680
MR but the key feature is that MR using

900
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,520
genetic variance as the instrument. So

901
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,440
this good thing or sometimes a bad thing

902
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,599
because sometimes we are very happy or

903
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,520
excited because of the property of the

904
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,440
genetic variance but sometimes we also

905
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:04,560
very frustrated because we know that

906
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,960
genetic variance can violated money I

907
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,680
assumptions in ministrals.

908
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:14,320
So we still wish to the do the causal

909
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:16,960
influence using the MR but MR here I

910
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,680
think is more kind of explorative

911
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,400
methods if not the very final cause of

912
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,920
influence methods. I understand everyone

913
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,760
is very excited about the causal

914
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,880
influence conclusion but MR can only

915
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,200
give you very initial. So usually the

916
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,280
typical application of MI is to first

917
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,599
highlight the variables you think have

918
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,160
the causal relationship and then later

919
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,440
you do a more another coal influence

920
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,200
methods focusing on those highlighted

921
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:48,240
exposures. So this is typically

922
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:51,280
pipeline. Um again the very important

923
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,560
features on my today's present is that

924
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,400
we only introduced three I assumptions.

925
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,320
Remember that in coal inference

926
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,400
assumption is very important. How many

927
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,560
assumption we have determined how

928
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,720
precise conclusion you can get because

929
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,720
we only use three I assumption. You

930
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,359
typically actually doing the uh sharp

931
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,320
non hypothesis test. So that is this is

932
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:17,440
very uh important concludes that in most

933
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:20,240
scenarios the purpose of MI is just to

934
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,920
do testing. We do not do estimation. We

935
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,640
just want to test hypothesal effect. So

936
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,560
the main conclusion of MI is typically

937
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,720
that we believe there exist some cause

938
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,880
effect but we have no idea what they

939
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,040
cause effect really look like. So

940
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,040
usually we will use another methods to

941
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,960
solve this problem or use advanced MR

942
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,119
methods.

943
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,920
And again uh the really important

944
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,560
feature is that the difficulty and not

945
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,520
to mow from the computation. I want to

946
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,720
say again is that the MI is very easy

947
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,200
methods on my eyes and it also use very

948
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:59,359
tiny data particularly if you combine

949
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:02,480
Emma with other postg methods. Emma is

950
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,560
very simple but I spend much time to

951
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,119
emphasize the design because design is

952
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,160
actually much much more important than

953
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,560
the calculations in Emma.

954
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,920
If you have very good design maybe I

955
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,960
know I understand this is very difficult

956
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,640
because this is case by case but if you

957
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,319
can find a scenario that

958
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,240
everyone are really happy nearly

959
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:27,280
everyone happy with the IV assumptions

960
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,760
that they are really happy about you

961
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,240
using that genetic variant to do the MRA

962
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,079
or IV analysis

963
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,119
you conclusion will be much much

964
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,520
valuable that's very important because

965
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,920
coal conclusion is very exciting but

966
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,319
they are so many cost convolutions

967
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,319
published by Emma papers in low quality

968
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:49,760
that is very frustrating.

969
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:52,319
So we really um happy with the good

970
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,920
design even your final conclusion is not

971
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,000
significant because I understand because

972
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,079
we sometimes we have the pressures to

973
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,920
publishing some papers we really have to

974
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,400
end up with significant results but in

975
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,960
coal influence there is the so-called

976
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,000
publication bs so that's why in coal

977
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,240
influence we really happy to see a coal

978
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,240
influence methods like m analysis with

979
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,560
good design even you find a conclusion

980
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,280
is not significant that is still very

981
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,319
good papers So that is typically all the

982
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,000
summary of the MR for the conditional uh

983
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,880
sorry for the traditional and

984
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,200
conventional MR analysis. But of course

985
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,359
there are also some actually many

986
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:36,480
advanced MR topics because I cannot uh

987
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:38,640
look into uh each of them but

988
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,680
there are many advanced topics. I think

989
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,200
they can be again divided to two groups.

990
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,680
So the first group is more from the

991
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,839
methology perspective or say the

992
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,240
statistical perspective. So we can

993
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:54,640
consider more complicated

994
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:57,920
uh models. We can answers more precise

995
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,319
causal effect because remember that if

996
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,640
you only do the

997
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:04,880
traditional MMR we only to do testing.

998
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,560
So the n hypothesis means that you

999
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,880
believe that that there's no cause

1000
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,040
effect which this statement is too

1001
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,680
strong. Sometimes we are interested in a

1002
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,920
more precise causal effect. So that's

1003
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,560
why we need more advanced amattopics for

1004
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,359
the nonlinear time wirings and the

1005
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,200
individual level causal effect. But

1006
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,599
again this will require additional

1007
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,280
assumptions. When we do coal inference

1008
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,359
when we make additional assumptions we

1009
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,200
should be very careful about this

1010
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,760
because many assumptions could be

1011
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,240
violated in your application.

1012
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,920
So this is a trade-off and another

1013
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:44,000
direction of advanced MI is based on the

1014
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,800
um application considerations because MI

1015
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:51,040
is the genetic epidemiology methods.

1016
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,040
Sometimes we used Emma in epidemi and

1017
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,599
genetic scenarios. We need to think

1018
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,200
about some specific problems. For

1019
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,280
example, we need to think about

1020
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,359
selection bi. We need to think about the

1021
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,760
sample brows. We also need to deal with

1022
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:05,599
missing data. So how can we use the MI

1023
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,920
in such scenarios? There are many

1024
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:12,640
methods proposed so that if this problem

1025
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,560
is applicable to your application you

1026
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,520
can consider this advanced topics. I

1027
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:21,200
highlighted some very good papers for

1028
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:25,040
each one of them. And also if you do the

1029
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:27,440
genetics data usually we do uh mutomics

1030
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,400
data and we have the protein or

1031
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,480
expression level and uh which means that

1032
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,520
if we do the M with them we typically

1033
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:39,280
use CQL or PQDL and it will also

1034
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,440
involves many uh start problems and

1035
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,280
based on this there are many novel

1036
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:48,160
methods proposed to help you get

1037
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,599
to do the better MR analysis with this

1038
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:53,760
PQ and PQR this side and of course we

1039
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,920
can also use Emma with few this is quite

1040
00:44:53,760 --> 00:45:00,079
flexible. So M essentially is just a

1041
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:03,280
simple method but this is this is

1042
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,200
actually the kind of conclusion that if

1043
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,200
you find some causal influence method

1044
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,040
simple which means that this is better.

1045
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,520
So the simple method sometimes is better

1046
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,520
than complicated and fancy methods but

1047
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,680
the design becomes more important. So

1048
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:18,560
you want to ensure that you do a lot of

1049
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:21,040
MR analysis and you want to convince

1050
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,960
others believe that your MR contribution

1051
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,240
are reliable.

1052
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,319
So you need to think about many

1053
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,440
scenarios in your specified application.

1054
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:32,079
So not only just doing MI in a in a

1055
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,160
mechanical or in a mechanical way. You

1056
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,280
need to think about it like the more

1057
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,440
like a more flexible ways to deal with

1058
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,800
all the potential problems you think

1059
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,800
there could be in your analysis.

1060
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,920
and the right I give you a quick

1061
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,760
introduction to the one topic of the

1062
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,000
advanced methods. So Mway Mi is just um

1063
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,839
more generalized version of Emma. So

1064
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,680
this is good because once you understand

1065
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,440
the MUT if you this is good I mean if

1066
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,760
you understand the general version you

1067
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,800
can of course understand more special

1068
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,440
version. So the M is good. So M is good.

1069
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,079
The main reason I think is it can be

1070
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,160
indeed used in many scenarios. So in

1071
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,920
your application sometimes if you using

1072
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,640
the uh cause of mediation analysis you

1073
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,880
can use the MMR if you are interested in

1074
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,839
some key risk factor selection problems

1075
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:29,280
you can also transform it to MMR.

1076
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:32,240
So here M is very flexible method so

1077
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,000
that's why I highly recommend it to you

1078
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:38,800
but again this is about advanced MR

1079
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:41,040
topics. So um if you are uh if your

1080
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:45,040
application really consider very narrow

1081
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,280
questions you can use the MMA

1082
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,040
right so this is about the Emma part and

1083
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,000
I want to extend a little bit to

1084
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,839
connecting Emma to other topics um

1085
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
>> hold on we have like one minute

1086
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:59,200
>> okay yeah I just randomly pick one

1087
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,880
topics for example if you um

1088
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,960
>> so if you think PRS so PRS is typically

1089
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,359
um you can use the PRS with individual

1090
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,680
level data and it will have the

1091
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:12,079
individual level MR. Individual MR

1092
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,319
analysis is quite good because it can

1093
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,319
you can combine with many advanced IV

1094
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,960
and machine learning methods because IV

1095
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,400
and machine learning methods are many

1096
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,520
cases are based on individual level

1097
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:26,000
data. So do not limited your MR to the

1098
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,000
summary data level. You can do lot of

1099
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,480
fancy things using the individual level

1100
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,200
data. So particularly if you have PIS if

1101
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,599
you have individual level data and you

1102
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,680
will get many interesting conclusions.

1103
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,280
So of course we connect Emma to any

1104
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,240
other topics like genetic correlation

1105
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,400
for collocizations

1106
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,960
right this is about all the things I

1107
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,800
here I also provide some MR learning

1108
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,319
resources and I would say thanks to all

1109
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:55,480
my friends um for this slides. Thank you

1110
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,480
so much.

1111
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,520
>> So any other questions then be free to

1112
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,440
ask.

1113
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,240
>> Thank you so much. And if you wanted to

1114
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:07,119
ask yours in person, you're here.

1115
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:09,359
>> Actually question.

1116
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,359
>> Well, I get I I put in in the chat

1117
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:13,760
earlier a question that what does it

1118
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:17,200
mean to say that the you know the

1119
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,280
genetics is randomized? like obviously I

1120
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:22,079
can get behind that being the case

1121
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,920
between the parents but across everybody

1122
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,720
else that's obviously false. So

1123
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:30,400
>> yeah. So yeah, this is a good question

1124
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:32,240
and also hard to answer because uh if we

1125
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,559
look at the population level the

1126
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:39,839
randomized actually uh means that the

1127
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,839
genetic factor of individuals

1128
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,920
sorry the individual's genetic factors

1129
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:46,240
are kind of independent of the

1130
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,160
environmental factors.

1131
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,960
So,

1132
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,839
so the environmental factors because we

1133
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,640
are typically the confounders and in

1134
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:59,200
every analysis framework we wish to say

1135
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:02,400
that the instrument is independent of

1136
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,720
the confounders. That's why we wish to

1137
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,720
say that the instrumental variables is

1138
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,559
independent of the confounders. So in

1139
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,079
other words, it's kind of randomized

1140
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,160
because when we say something is

1141
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,400
randomized, we would typically believe

1142
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:17,599
that that thing is independent of other

1143
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,839
variables. So,

1144
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:22,240
>> yeah, it just seems to not obviously

1145
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:24,240
hold true for humans, right? Just

1146
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,760
straightforwardly be false.

1147
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,280
>> I mean, yeah, for all of the reasons

1148
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,520
that we're familiar with in genetics,

1149
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,319
like genetic variation is not random

1150
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,079
compared to

1151
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:34,480
>> that's good point because as I said,

1152
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,200
this is the belief and there are some

1153
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,280
people disagree with mandization because

1154
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,400
they don't believe that the genetic

1155
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:45,119
virus are indeed randomized. So this

1156
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:47,040
kind of debate but uh if you are happy

1157
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,119
with the random meeting the random

1158
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,520
meeting will give you the one motivation

1159
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:54,160
to believe that gener factors are

1160
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,839
randomized but that's not granted. Um,

1161
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,280
thanks so much. And also just like for a

1162
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:00,480
beautiful talk, I love all your emphasis

1163
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,599
on um, all of the assumptions. Um, and I

1164
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,559
was wondering for somebody who was new

1165
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,720
to this field and you had a, you know,

1166
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,920
well formulated research question and it

1167
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,200
sort of seems like you were saying that

1168
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,640
sometimes people don't have well

1169
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,960
formulated research questions when they

1170
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,119
come in, but let's say they did. Um, how

1171
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,440
would they go about really doing that

1172
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,960
work of working out what is the right

1173
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,760
method? What are the right sorts of

1174
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,319
assumptions? Are there like resources to

1175
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,319
uh yeah to get up to mastery of that?

1176
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:28,960
>> Yeah, thanks for the question. So I

1177
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:31,119
think the main development of Emma is

1178
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,440
actually all about assumptions. If you

1179
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,960
look at the slides, so assumptions is

1180
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,520
most important concept in causal

1181
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,760
influence. Why we propose new methods is

1182
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,680
because that we believe some assumptions

1183
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,400
are violated. That's why we propose new

1184
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:47,119
methods. But new methods comes with new

1185
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,119
assumptions. So in to some extent you

1186
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,040
can say that everything is about

1187
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,119
assumptions. Sometimes we don't believe

1188
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,359
the assumptions are satisfied. That's

1189
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,400
why we do lots of sensitivity analysis.

1190
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:00,319
We want to tell the audience that okay I

1191
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,160
do lots of sensitivity analysis and

1192
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,680
triangulation strategies based on

1193
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,000
different assumptions. My results are

1194
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,240
still stable. So in other words they

1195
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,480
want to show that okay I don't know

1196
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,240
which assumptions are correct but I do

1197
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,079
many analysis use different assumptions

1198
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:17,599
my results are still stable which means

1199
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:20,000
that I think they satisfied all the

1200
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,559
assumptions or this they this satis one

1201
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,319
of the assumptions and I concl ation is

1202
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,839
reliable. So that is the key idea. Um

1203
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:28,160
yeah, I hope this answer the question.

1204
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,760
Yeah,

1205
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,200
>> great. And I think for time we'll end

1206
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,200
there. Let's thank our speaker one more

1207
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,200
time.
