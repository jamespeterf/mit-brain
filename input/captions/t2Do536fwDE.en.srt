1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,876
My mom has really been my rock.

2
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:03,503
A woman who didn't have –

3
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,422
who has an elementary school education,

4
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:10,343
but so wise in so many areas of her
life. A role model for me and many.

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,513
She has been an inspiration,
certainly always pushing me

6
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,434
to strive for more. To aim for greatness.
To never settle.

7
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,728
My name is Erika Ramirez.

8
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,730
I currently live in Texas,

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,024
but I'm originally born in Caracas,
Venezuela.

10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,943
I am first-generation to attend college.

11
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:30,947
Education was seen as something
definitely to aim for, to do.

12
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,783
My parents
didn't have the ability to do so.

13
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:39,497
So my parents always – were always focused
and made it a big deal

14
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,249
for us to stay in school,

15
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,377
to go to school, to go to college,
to aim for greater and higher.

16
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:48,298
I remember I was married,
I went to school half of the time.

17
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,759
I worked half of the time. Then kids came.

18
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,761
So then I took a big pause in school.

19
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,721
And then I was a mom, a full-time mom.

20
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,767
So it was not
until my kids were a little older

21
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,520
that I went back to school
and I had to finish school.

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,108
It was kind of me paving the way,
you know, as I navigated motherhood and,

23
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,445
you know, being a wife, being a full-time
mom, full-time

24
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,031
wife, and and working
full-time and going to school full-time.

25
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,867
My kids are back home in Texas,

26
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,079
and I'm here,
I travel back and forth every weekend.

27
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,497
So I see them on the weekends.

28
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,331
It's intense.

29
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:25,126
And I think, I hope
that they appreciate what mom is doing.

30
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:28,797
I think that they do because I hear them
talking to their friends,

31
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,257
you know, in the background, like,
“Oh, mom goes to MIT.”

32
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,801
“Mom is, you know, stopped work.”

33
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,469
“And she's going to school full-time.”

34
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,514
And, you know, “Mom is in her mid/late 40s.”

35
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,849
“And, you know, if she can do it,
we can do it.”

36
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:45,939
So it's inspire them to know
that really there's no age limit.

37
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,732
You can do anything
you set your heart and mind to.
