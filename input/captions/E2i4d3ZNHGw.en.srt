1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,480
thank you very much hello everyone it's

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,879
a pleasure to be here welcome to MIT I

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,920
want to tell you about Quantum and in

4
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:12,080
particular Quantum materials for the

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,839
next you know technological Revolution

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,160
for Quantum 2.0 now I know this is a

7
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,640
broad audience so I'll start very simple

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,560
you know Quantum materials is the

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,039
fundamental theory that we have that

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,000
explains you know the behavior of

11
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,199
subatomic particles atoms molecules and

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,039
in general the physical world it was

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,880
developed over you know the past Century

14
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,040
by some of the greatest Minds you know

15
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,480
that have ever happened in human history

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,840
I'm sure you're very familiar with the

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,520
names that are listed here and it is a

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,120
very strange Theory yeah tells us that

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,160
you cannot know everything about an

20
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,920
object that thing is called Quantum

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,039
uncertainty objects can be in two or

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,000
more places or states exactly at the

23
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,280
same time that is known as Quantum

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,480
superposition objects can penetrate

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,399
through obstacles or through walls that

26
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,600
is known Quantum tunneling and objects

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,560
can be inextricably linked or correlated

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,799
even when infinitely apart and that is

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,720
known as quantum

30
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:16,759
entanglement now pretty much all of our

31
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,920
modern technology is based on quantum

32
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,840
mechanics and we call this Quantum 1.0

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,720
this goes from transistors and computer

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,960
phones to atomic clocks and GPS dials

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,920
LED photo voltes lasers Optical

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,479
communication superconductors for NMR

37
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,560
roscopy Medical Imaging and all photod

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,920
detection

39
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,000
Technologies and we say that this

40
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,920
technology is based on Quantum 1.0

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,640
because they use quantum mechanics at a

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,439
relatively simple level okay at a very

43
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,520
basic level as you know the countries

44
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,079
that have mastered Quantum 1.0 are the

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,560
most developed and you know most

46
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:57,680
powerful countries in the world today

47
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:00,360
now over the next 10 to 50 years okay

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,759
we're going to see a revolution in LED

49
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,000
in technology led by Quantum 2.0 this

50
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,200
will be the technology of the 21st

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,679
century where we're going to be able to

52
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,200
do things and use quantum mechanics at a

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,080
much deeper level which is going to

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,319
enable us to do many more things than we

55
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,840
were able to do before in particular we

56
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:21,120
will be able to use ultra secure Quantum

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,640
Communications and networks immune to

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,480
hacking we will be able to perform

59
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,560
Quantum simulations to discover new

60
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,360
types of materials new Catalyst

61
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,239
molecules medicis new types of superc

62
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,440
conductors

63
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,840
we will be able to use quantum computers

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,879
for factoring cryptography searching

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,800
optimization for a variety of algorithms

66
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,000
where we will these quantum computers

67
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,159
will work orders of magnitude faster

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,560
than our best super super computers

69
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:51,000
nowadays and we will be able to use use

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,159
new type of quantum sensors for and

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,480
Metrology for climate Energy Water

72
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:56,400
security space and in general basic

73
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,599
science

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,040
applications now in order to realize all

75
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,799
of the these things we're going to need

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,799
also new Quantum materials for many of

77
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,840
these tasks okay and MIT faculty have

78
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,400
played in many cases the pioneering role

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,840
in all of these Technologies and all of

80
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,440
these science okay and you can see here

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,120
you know people from Peter Shore you

82
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,720
know vented the first algorithm to of

83
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,599
you know we have here Noel prices Cav

84
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,519
price Winns Etc a lot of that basic

85
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:27,799
science and technology is happening has

86
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:31,319
happened at MIT and is happening at

87
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,640
MIT now traditionally for new going to

88
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,519
materials which is what I want to focus

89
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,760
on we have had two traditional platforms

90
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,599
to investigate Quantum materials the

91
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,920
first one which is the oldest is to look

92
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,319
at actual materials okay chunks of

93
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,720
crystals where you know this is for

94
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,360
example a high temperature Cate

95
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,239
superconductor the typical lens scale is

96
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,120
of order an anstrom the distance you

97
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,720
know between atoms in solids here with

98
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,000
this platform we have been able to

99
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,599
investigate hundreds of thousands of

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,040
materials but we have a relatively weak

101
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,760
you know you we we have very few ways in

102
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,120
which we can modify these materials you

103
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,599
know if you want to investigate a new

104
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,000
material you have to grow a new material

105
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,360
with a new composition with new

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,639
chemistry we cannot really tune very

107
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,519
much and control these

108
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,479
materials on the other hand about two

109
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,360
decades ago a new platform emerged it's

110
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,400
called ultracold atoms in Optical

111
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,400
latices where you know Atomic physicists

112
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,639
can shine lasers at each other they can

113
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,680
place atoms in this periodic potential

114
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,600
and they have Exquisite control over all

115
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,800
of the parameters of their system so

116
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,400
with just one system they can tune the

117
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,080
interactions between these atoms and do

118
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,039
plenty of things and change many things

119
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,919
to see if they can simulate the behavior

120
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:46,280
of quantum materials these are you know

121
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,560
more than Quantum simulators of

122
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,160
materials yeah and what I want to tell

123
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,080
you about today is about a new platform

124
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,720
it's called Mor Quantum matter the

125
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,720
typical lens scale here was lens scale

126
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,199
was a micrometer weight of light here

127
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,639
one Armstrong point 1 nanometers here

128
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,759
the typical lens scale is called the mor

129
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,160
length which is a order 10 nanometers so

130
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,160
it's very conveniently about a factor of

131
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,680
100 from either of these two lens scales

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,080
and this platform is also very

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,400
complementary to these two on one hand

134
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,120
we have a lot more control over this

135
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,400
platform and capability to tune you know

136
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,520
interactions and the system than with

137
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,800
traditional Quantum materials we don't

138
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,680
have quite as much freedom and control

139
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,759
ility and tunability as with the cold

140
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,840
atoms but on the other hand with this

141
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,280
platform we have been able to realize

142
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,240
pretty much all of the behaviors of

143
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,440
quantum matter and simulate them that we

144
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,720
know okay and in fact discovered quite a

145
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,160
new a few new ones that didn't exist

146
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,960
before which is something that this

147
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,800
community has been struggling because in

148
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,400
the ultra cold atoms field they're still

149
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,160
at relatively high temperatures to

150
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,919
realize many of the faces of cont to

151
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,840
matter that they would have interest in

152
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:03,400
realizing so what has enabled this more

153
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,840
Quantum mother platform so it's

154
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,240
something that you know has come to be

155
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,599
you know is now known as twiston which

156
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,560
is the fact that we can do something

157
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:13,360
with 2D materials that was impossible to

158
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,479
do in the history of Material Science

159
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,360
until recently when you have a three

160
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,919
dimensional material the arrangement

161
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,720
between the atomic planes is determined

162
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,360
by physics by thermodynamics you know

163
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,639
chemistry you get what you

164
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,000
get however when you have two

165
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,720
dimensional materials you can do the

166
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,039
following you can take a two-

167
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,240
dimensional material for example

168
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,160
graphine and I can put another two

169
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,319
dimensional material on top with any

170
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,680
angle of rotation that I want between

171
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,000
the crystalline structures okay that

172
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,319
thing called twiston XS when you

173
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,240
superimpose two periodic structures at

174
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,800
an angle they form a mo pattern okay the

175
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,400
mor pattern is this pattern that you can

176
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,560
see in the screen here with this white

177
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:56,759
balls there and when you do this you can

178
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,479
dramatically change the properties of

179
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,400
the header structure that you have just

180
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,400
assembled yeah

181
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,080
using this trick okay we have been able

182
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,720
now in the span of a few years this

183
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,400
development happened in 2018 and in the

184
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,639
span of just a few years we have been

185
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,960
able to create new types of correlated

186
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,080
insulators new unconventional

187
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,240
superconductors topological faes plenty

188
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,919
of them magnets quas crystals new fer

189
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,080
electrics strange metal gener V crystals

190
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,400
exonic insulators pneumatic systems and

191
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,280
the list goes on we have realized all of

192
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,840
the behaviors of quantum matter that we

193
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,240
know and quite a few new ones that we

194
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,039
didn't know about using this platform

195
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,400
just by using some simple materials and

196
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:41,199
playing with the angle between their

197
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,919
structure so what I want to give you

198
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,639
today is just a flavor so that you can

199
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,360
you know go home and look a little bit

200
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,680
more and read a bit more about three

201
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,319
examples of things that we've been able

202
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:55,000
to do with this type of Platform One Is

203
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:56,800
Magic Ang graphine and how you know this

204
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,240
can help us you know give us insight for

205
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,840
Quantum materials for Ultra strong

206
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,680
superc conductors another one is about

207
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,800
new type of more FCC materials for or

208
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,560
Quantum materials for neuromorphic you

209
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,479
know Computing and the last one will be

210
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,199
new more Quantum magnets or Quantum

211
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:16,080
materials for topological Quantum

212
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:19,000
Computing

213
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,960
so magicangle graphine turns out if you

214
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,960
put a few layers of graphine okay two or

215
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,680
three for example on top of each other

216
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,919
with a certain angle between the

217
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,159
structures for two layers is 1.1 de for

218
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:35,360
three layers as I'm showing here it's

219
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:37,919
1.6 de okay the material graphine which

220
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,039
is not a superconductor turns theer

221
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,560
structure into superconductor and it

222
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:44,560
turns out to be the strongest

223
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,680
superconductor that we know in the world

224
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,240
okay by far actually what do I mean a

225
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,320
superc conductivity is a state of matter

226
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,399
where current can flow without

227
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,600
dissipation of energy in order to do

228
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,600
that the electrons have to form Pairs

229
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,440
and these pairs are known as coupon and

230
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,800
Cooper pairs okay now the pairing blue

231
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,959
the pairing strength of electrons in

232
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,839
Cooper pairs is what characterizes the

233
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:12,000
strength of a superconductor and it

234
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,800
turns out that pairing glue in Magic

235
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,959
angle graphine is the strongest by far

236
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,920
that we have in nature this is something

237
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,399
which has been experimentally measured

238
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,399
it is not theoretically understood how

239
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,360
come that electrons in Magic angle

240
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,600
graphine are so strongly paired just to

241
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,120
give you an idea the superconductor

242
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,640
aluminum which is one that is used

243
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,360
nowadays in most superc conducting

244
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:38,240
quantum computers okay in super cubits

245
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,240
if the C pairs in aluminum had the same

246
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,560
pairing glue strength that they have in

247
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,040
Magic angle graphine aluminum could be a

248
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,040
superconductor at well above 1,000

249
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,839
Kelvin temperature okay way way way

250
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,920
above room temperature but aluminum CER

251
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,920
and aluminum are super weakly paired and

252
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,800
as a result they superc conduct at very

253
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,839
low temperatures okay so this is just

254
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,440
one example one example of how this

255
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,560
field of more superc conductors is

256
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,120
giving insight into strongly correlated

257
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,000
superconductivity superc conductivity

258
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,560
which is very strong now what are good

259
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,560
are news you know what good are new

260
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,079
strong superc conductors for okay this

261
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,240
is an image that probably many of you

262
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:21,839
have seen this is the new generation of

263
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,440
magnets for Fusion research you know

264
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,920
this is span out of MIT and you know

265
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,920
they're Bas you know used Now by

266
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,959
Commonwealth Fusion okay this latest

267
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,800
generation magnets for Fusion Energy are

268
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,760
based on high temperature

269
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,040
superconductors and these high

270
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,000
temperature superconductors they're

271
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,360
moderately strong superc conductors not

272
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,399
as strong as magic angle graphine but

273
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,440
quite strong and they share a similar

274
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,959
you know mechanism for a commcial superc

275
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,040
conductivity where it is not understood

276
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,480
which means that if with this much more

277
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,040
tunable platforms we're able to

278
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,040
understand better this only couple

279
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,560
superconductors we might be able to

280
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,000
design you know new Ultra strong

281
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,720
superconductors which could lead to much

282
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,800
more Compact and efficient magnets for

283
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,920
Fusion Energy but also new high

284
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,360
resolution Medical Imaging dissipation

285
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,120
less energy transport new Quantum

286
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,519
Computing and sensing Technologies Etc

287
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,120
basically all this you know would result

288
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,000
in energy security and efficiency which

289
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,440
will be critical for a sustainable

290
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,560
future this is just one example for more

291
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,519
superconductors now what about more

292
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,639
ferroelectrics okay so as probably many

293
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,320
of you know nowadays we're all

294
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:34,800
interested in AI in making AI more

295
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,399
efficient why don't we try to make it

296
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,000
work more like the brain you know and we

297
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,720
can learn you know and process

298
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,600
information with much less power like

299
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,639
our brain does okay so for this a

300
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,279
technology that is being used a lot are

301
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:51,480
actually neuromorphic devices which are

302
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:54,320
largely based on fertic materials so

303
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,600
with these Mor systems okay by playing

304
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,959
again with the structures the more

305
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,800
patterns and the tangles between the

306
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,680
structures we have been able to realize

307
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,959
a new type of ferroelectric device

308
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,040
colore ferroelectric which works

309
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:08,600
actually very similar is able to

310
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,880
implement operations very similar to the

311
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,959
way the brain does Okay so we've been

312
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,760
able to make new types of neuromorphic

313
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,560
devices which operate you know in terms

314
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,279
of their spiking and they have memory

315
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,600
based on this ferroelectric Behavior

316
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,959
which is completely different from

317
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,040
existing ferroelectrics it's a new

318
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:25,920
generation of fer electrics much more

319
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,399
capable than previous fedel electrics

320
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,680
and you can look at this paper recently

321
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:32,639
published in nature about it but not

322
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,160
only that this type of more devices

323
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,959
which can be FCC you can incorporate

324
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,920
them at the same time that you bring

325
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,440
other functionality for example superc

326
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,360
conductivity so last year also we were

327
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,000
able to realize you know the first more

328
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,560
superconductor which was also fed

329
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,639
electric material so material which is

330
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,399
both fed electric and superconductor so

331
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:56,079
that now you can switch between two

332
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,240
states but there not a high and a low

333
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,839
resistance state is a high and a zero

334
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,639
resistance state because it's a superc

335
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,399
conductor F Electric System yeah and you

336
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:08,040
know again what good are new more

337
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,360
electrics for you know there is this big

338
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,800
bottleneck you know in Computing the

339
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,639
performance bottleneck due to the fact

340
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,600
that now that you have to communicate

341
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,240
between where you operate you know you

342
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,480
do the operations the logic and where

343
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,680
you store information memory okay this

344
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,240
type of fed electrics and other ones

345
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,000
that we have discovered having actually

346
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,920
several types of new more electrics you

347
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,600
know discoveries in the past just couple

348
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,920
of years years and there's huge interest

349
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,480
in this can allow you to put the logic

350
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,320
and the memory exactly in the same spot

351
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,839
so that you don't have to waste 80% of

352
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,519
your time and your energy communicating

353
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:44,600
between logic and

354
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,000
memory now this will enable you know

355
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,120
Ultra fast and energy efficient

356
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,639
Computing you know using this type of

357
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,759
you know neomorphic platforms will be

358
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,360
critical for Next Generation Micro

359
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:57,560
Technologies and for AI

360
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,759
Etc the last thing that I want to tell

361
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,440
you about is a little bit more exotic

362
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,480
are into the future even that some of

363
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,639
these that I've mentioned which is this

364
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,120
Mor Quantum magnets and the fractional

365
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,440
Quantum anomalous H effect so the

366
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,639
fractional the regular fractional

367
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,720
Quantum H effect is an effect that

368
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,279
occurs in physics when you have a system

369
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,360
of electrons in two dimension for

370
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,199
example in Silicon or in Gom Maronite

371
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,199
and you apply a high perpendicular

372
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,759
magnetic

373
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:27,920
field you get a whole effect which is a

374
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,399
measurement of the voltage in the

375
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,399
perpendicular direction to the current

376
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:35,040
flow and this whole effect this voltage

377
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,160
happens to be the whole resistance

378
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,880
happens to be quantized with an accuracy

379
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:44,560
of one part in a billion actually 100

380
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:48,560
billion okay to a very precise value

381
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,600
yeah in this fractional qu whole effect

382
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,000
your electrons acquire very exotic

383
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,519
properties turns out the electron seems

384
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,560
to spit into three okay or they have

385
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,040
actually into quas particles we have a

386
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,600
fraction charge of let's say 1/3 of an

387
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,839
electron and they have very interesting

388
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,839
topological properties properties which

389
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,040
combine the field of mathematics

390
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,800
topology with physics and strong

391
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,959
correlations you know this was

392
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,600
discovered at MIT in the 80s it was

393
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:17,600
given Nobel Prize in physics in

394
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,440
1998 a big you know problem or a big

395
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,160
obstacle to use the fractional Quantum

396
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,480
anomal fractional quum effect in your

397
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,600
daily life is the fact that you have to

398
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,399
apply extremely high magnetic field

399
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,600
yeah and that's maybe some reason why

400
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,440
some of you may not have heard about

401
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,759
this

402
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,000
effect with the mor systems in the past

403
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,040
year

404
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,800
okay the community has discovered the

405
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,480
fractional Quantum anomalous whole

406
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,600
effect what does it mean it means the

407
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,440
fractional Quantum whole effect with all

408
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,920
this exotic physics but at zero magnetic

409
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,639
field this is something which was

410
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,600
published in nature last year and recent

411
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,600
you know two different Mor systems

412
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,440
having you know one by shadon Shu at the

413
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,079
University of Washington in Seattle one

414
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,040
by my colleague lju here at MIT we have

415
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:08,680
been able to realize as a community this

416
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,160
new state of matter that didn't exist

417
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:14,600
before the fractional Quantum anomos Hol

418
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,839
State okay now apart from being super

419
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,759
interesting from the physics point of

420
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,639
view what could this lead to okay what

421
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,560
good are these new Mor Quantum magnets

422
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:25,199
for turns out you heard a talk earlier

423
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,639
today by my colleague willber about

424
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:31,839
Quantum Computing okay Quantum Computing

425
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,839
is something that would be great but so

426
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,959
far we have not been able to realize you

427
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,880
know proper quantum computers because

428
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,720
Quantum bits are very sensitive to the

429
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,920
coherence it's very easy for them to

430
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,240
lose their Quantum coherence and hence

431
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,040
all the interesting properties that that

432
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,920
you know Quantum allows you to do for

433
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,759
years now theories have been

434
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,519
hypothesizing that if we could just

435
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:58,040
encode our Quantum bits in systems which

436
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:00,600
were robust to the coherence yeah we

437
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,720
would be able to make fa tolerant

438
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,720
Quantum Computing okay a much more

439
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,760
robust type of quantum Computing with

440
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,319
much much less orders of magnitude I'm

441
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,120
talking about many orders of magnitude

442
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:14,919
less number of cubits much more robust

443
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,039
okay the Theory's favorite platform to

444
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:21,640
realize this type of topological Quantum

445
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:24,280
bits are fractional Quantum whole states

446
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,640
coupled to superc conductors but

447
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,480
traditionally these two things are like

448
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,240
they go against each other superc

449
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,520
conductor don't like magnetic field okay

450
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,360
and fraction to whole effect only

451
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,760
happens at very high magnetic field so

452
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,600
it's very hard to think of how to put

453
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,640
this two things together okay but now

454
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,799
because we have fractional Quantum anous

455
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,280
effect fraction at zerom magnetic field

456
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,480
it's no problem to attach it to

457
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,080
superconductor so one of the biggest

458
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,360
perhaps biggest obstacle that people

459
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,840
thought would be you know to realize

460
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:59,400
topological quantum computer you know

461
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,720
it's gone okay and now still a lot of

462
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,880
research needs to be done but this is

463
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,559
something that plenty plenty of people

464
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,919
this has generated an enormous amount of

465
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,679
interest in the physics community and

466
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,080
also in some companies

467
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,720
so all of these things that I've told

468
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,159
you that we have done we have made them

469
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,640
with very simple materials in most cases

470
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:20,960
most of these faces you can realize it

471
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,039
just with carbonin and just you know do

472
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,640
it this okay so there is something which

473
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,960
is quite extraordinary you can almost

474
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,919
put aside the entire periodic table and

475
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,600
just with one or two materials work

476
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,440
realize all the behaviors of matter that

477
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:36,799
you have in the universe yeah now are we

478
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,280
there yet well not quite okay we need

479
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,919
there still a lot of basic research and

480
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:44,000
Engineering to solve many very difficult

481
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,799
problems we need a big Quantum Workforce

482
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,240
lots more graduate students you know

483
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:51,440
getting trained on Quantum to tackle all

484
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,880
these challenges and especially we need

485
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,960
a lot of automation okay I always tell

486
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,880
people that right now my grad students

487
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,200
are like medieval monks you know writing

488
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,720
a very beautiful manuscript one device

489
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,840
at a time is gorgeous it does all this

490
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,039
feny physics but it's one device at a

491
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,559
time it takes you know a month or more

492
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,960
you know and this all very manual

493
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,080
sometimes with Scotch tape and graphite

494
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,480
you may have heard about this famous

495
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,679
graphine that you use Scotch tape and

496
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,080
graphite we do use Scotch tape manually

497
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,840
and graphite for many of these things so

498
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,159
we need someone to come up and invent a

499
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,559
press but not just a regular press but a

500
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,640
Quantum press okay so this is something

501
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,480
that there is a lot of interest

502
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,880
developing in the community it is the

503
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,919
right moment to automate all of this

504
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,440
okay and we need this automation because

505
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:38,280
as you can imagine with instead of

506
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,880
playing with the angle and we can also

507
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,760
play with the number of layers and with

508
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,480
the different 2D materials we have

509
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,559
infinite possibilities actually to do

510
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,520
all of this and infinite possibilities

511
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,960
are many possibilities to explore with

512
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,320
gather students working by hand with SC

513
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,240
tape okay so we really need to develop

514
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,039
this Quantum press technology okay and

515
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,480
there are some groups that are

516
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:59,360
interested and some interest industries

517
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,640
that are interested but that's the

518
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,799
critical step now if we want to scale

519
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,120
this up and use this and deploy this

520
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,679
massively in Technologies because a lot

521
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,760
of the fundamental physics has already

522
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,760
been

523
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,120
done with this let me just end by saying

524
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,080
that what I've been telling you about

525
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,440
are three examples of twist Electronics

526
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,880
okay but actually a whole bunch of other

527
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,960
communities have realized that they can

528
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,720
also play with things you know and

529
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:27,200
rotate things so the ultra cold atoms

530
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,919
Community is now playing with Twisted

531
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,640
Optical latices to do simulators based

532
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:35,360
on you know Twisted cold atoms the trick

533
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,520
about electrons can be done also with

534
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,600
Fons or vibrations so there is also more

535
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,320
and twisted fonics so in twistr onics

536
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,280
the strict to make this strong superc

537
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,039
conductors at the magic angle actually

538
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,840
what you do there is you reduce the

539
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,799
electron velocity the Fring velocity to

540
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,880
zero turns out you can reduce the Fon

541
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:56,120
velocity to zero and realize also many

542
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,240
applications which are very interesting

543
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,159
from the point of view of sound

544
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,159
propagation heat propagation Etc you can

545
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,039
also do this with photons you can reduce

546
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,400
the speed of lightly to Zero by playing

547
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,520
with this twisting okay so this is

548
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,400
called Moran Twisted photonics this is

549
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,440
actually the largest growing field other

550
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,799
than the electronics and with huge

551
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,039
programs by the Department of Defense

552
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,840
because you can realize all kinds of

553
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:18,360
non-lineal optical elements and things

554
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,600
going to reduce the velocity of light

555
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,440
tremendously but why stop there you know

556
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,559
it turns out these Mor patterns that I

557
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,200
showed you have very different density

558
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:29,440
of States locally and they have local

559
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,279
electrochemical activity and Catal

560
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,279
catalytic activity so several groups are

561
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:35,919
now working on tunable electrochemistry

562
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:37,960
with more systems where they can do

563
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,760
chemical on the Nanos scale by looking

564
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,679
at these Mor patterns and you can also

565
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:46,480
do very interesting catalysis and last

566
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,559
but not least my high energy and coso

567
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,240
colleagues and cosmology colleagues they

568
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,520
think they can do also more gravity and

569
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,520
cosmology by playing you know with you

570
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,080
know these Twisted materials and

571
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,720
structures because there are analogies

572
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,720
of these properties in terms of the

573
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,520
formation of space time which map onto

574
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,400
their cosmological problems so with this

575
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,679
I want to you know thank you all thank

576
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,760
you my group members you know this work

577
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,080
is done by many groups of students and

578
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,320
postdocs plenty of collaborators you

579
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,919
know we have lots of support which we're

580
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,520
very thankful for and you know we're

581
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,360
back to these type of meetings after a

582
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,559
few years where it was tricky and that's

583
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,720
really a lot of fun and I want to thank

584
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:24,750
you all for your attention happy to take

585
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:31,160
any questions

586
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:31,160
[Applause]

587
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,120
do we have any questions this is the

588
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,120
last presentation of the

589
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,240
day hi there um one of your slides

590
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,320
mentioned high temperature

591
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,000
superconductors what temperature are we

592
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,679
talking about room temperature what what

593
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,279
okay thank you for the question because

594
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:53,760
very good to specify the way we

595
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,320
characterize in physics superconductors

596
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,640
is by something which is known as the

597
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,640
ratio of the critical temperature to the

598
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,440
firmy temperature basically is how high

599
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,919
is the critical temperature given how

600
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,279
much density of electrons you have in

601
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,679
your system okay so magic angle graphine

602
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,080
this Mor pattern as I mentioned at the

603
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:13,880
beginning the mor lens scale is of order

604
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,080
10 nanometers yeah and the super

605
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,360
conductivity occurs when you put two

606
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,880
electrons per Mo unit cell which means

607
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:24,520
two electrons in 10 by 10 nanom squ so

608
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,960
in 100 nanom square okay that's is a

609
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,000
density of el which is four of magnitude

610
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,960
smaller

611
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,799
than aluminum okay however the critical

612
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,679
temperature is actually above that of

613
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,039
aluminum it's you know about 2 Kelvin

614
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,799
okay so it's not that the critical

615
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,520
temperature is very high but the ratio

616
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,080
of the critical temperature to the firy

617
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,640
temperature okay to the of extremely

618
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,760
high is fours of magnitude larger than

619
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,679
in aluminum so if somehow we manage you

620
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,919
know it's amazing the magic angine

621
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,000
superc conducts at all at an observable

622
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,559
temperature because usually this pairing

623
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,960
glue for that density of electrons only

624
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,000
a few sprinkled here and there every 100

625
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,760
nanometer Square would Le to TCS of you

626
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,559
know less than 1 Melvin but it superc

627
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,400
conducts with a critical temperature

628
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,360
stronger than aluminum if we somehow

629
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,320
magically were able to take aluminum and

630
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,720
engineer the same physics the same per

631
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,720
glue strength okay at the metallic

632
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,080
densities of electrons of aluminum it

633
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,240
would superc conduct at more than a

634
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,360
th000 Kelvin yeah but we don't know how

635
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,360
to engineer those things yet

636
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,200
okay one more question and then call Dat

637
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,799
I think it's a very simple question

638
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,120
motivated by some of your last slides

639
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,760
where you're talking about selective

640
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,720
electrochemistry where you could have

641
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,760
different patterns both the

642
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,520
electrochemistry and also the

643
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,200
electromagnetics would mean that you

644
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,600
would have a lot of opportunities for

645
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,120
sensors you pattern electrochemical

646
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,640
sensors and pattering and that would be

647
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:00,600
interesting to see that area pursued it

648
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,360
is one is now it has been studied at

649
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,480
device prototype level that magic angine

650
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,720
for example is the best single Photon

651
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,360
detector at all frequencies that exist

652
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,640
in the world you can detect all the way

653
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,440
from terahertz to high energies and you

654
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,760
can detect single photons and it's the

655
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,039
fastest and the best it's a little bit

656
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,360
of a shame that we don't have this

657
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,799
Quantum press so that we you know we

658
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,159
don't know how to make a billion magic

659
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:25,399
Ang graphine devices fast and cheap okay

660
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,799
but if we knew you would have all your

661
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:29,320
satellites all your telescopes all your

662
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:31,760
Quantum C sensors based on this

663
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,000
technology if we can just only scale

664
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,200
this

665
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,470
up thank you Pablo thanks great

666
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,539
[Applause]

667
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,539
