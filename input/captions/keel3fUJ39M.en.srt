1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,919
Today I'm going to tell you about some

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,800
work that's been done in my lab over the

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,400
last couple of years or so uh where

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,160
we're interested in a new platform for

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,320
targeted theronostics that we call

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,199
antibbody bottle brush conjugates or

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,960
ABCs and I'll give you the sort of

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,000
history of this project what the goals

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,080
are and um where it stands today. All

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,800
right. So um to begin um should I stand

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,880
on this stage? Is there a reason not to?

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,920
I was going to walk around but um okay

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,440
if I cannot I'll do this. Um so to begin

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,120
I I I uh want to just sort of remind you

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,800
of one of the key principles of drug

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,559
development. That is the idea of a

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,800
therapeutic window which essentially

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,280
just defines the difference in dose

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,800
between a dose that has efficacy and a

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,559
dose that has toxicity. And um I would

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,160
say it's a safe assumption that

22
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,760
regardless of what medicine you are

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,760
developing, it doesn't matter what the

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,680
modality is, small molecule, big

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,440
molecule, you know, biologic, whatever,

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,080
you want the therapeutic window to be as

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,400
wide as possible. And you could argue

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,680
that the entire history of drug

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,080
development is essentially a um an

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,840
attempt to increasingly improve the

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,439
therapeutic windows of medicines for

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,119
different diseases. Um, and if you then

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,479
look at all the different ways that that

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,320
has been approached, you can break those

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,799
down into roughly two different general

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,159
areas that are shown here. One is what

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,799
I'm going to call therapeutic window

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,320
based on a mechanism of action. And one

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,240
example of those are these drugs called

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,560
molecularly targeted therapeutics. These

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,920
are the drugs that sort of came in uh

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,520
after sort of the early stage

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,840
chemotherapeutics in the context of

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,680
cancer where people started to develop

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,399
small molecules that could selectively

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,640
target biological pathways that for

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,720
example a cancer cell needs for survival

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,960
and a healthy cell does not need. So

49
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,280
even if the drug molecule is exposed to

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,079
both cell types, one is selectively

51
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,600
killed over the other one. Right? Um,

52
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,000
and you can contrast that with a

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,240
therapeutic window based on delivery.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,080
Um, which is basically just biasing

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,440
where the molecule goes. And so in this

56
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,280
case, if you have a healthy cell in a

57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,720
diseased cell, you achieve a therapeutic

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,640
window by just making the drug

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,080
preferentially go to the health to to

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,000
the disease cell and not the healthy

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,520
cell. Right? Now, um, both of these are

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,920
very powerful and have led to sort of,

63
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,160
you know, many many many valuable

64
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,599
medicines. Um but they both also face

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,000
substantial challenges particularly in

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,599
the context of cancer where for example

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,239
it's quite rare for there to be a

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,800
mechanism of action that a cancer cell

69
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,720
uh requires for survival but no healthy

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,239
tissue in the body also requires for

71
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,560
survival and hence we can have narrow

72
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,239
therapeutic windows because of sort of

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,319
ontarget off tissue effects. Um and

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,640
similarly you know even with say I would

75
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,560
I would say the gold standard of a a

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,879
delivery based therapeutic window which

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,280
would be an antibbody drug conjugate. Um

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,599
we know now that only a small fraction

79
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,440
of a of a dosed for example antibody

80
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,840
drug conjugate in any other kind of

81
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,239
delivery based system um ever actually

82
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,480
finds its way to target cells. And

83
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,800
oftentimes there are antigens that are

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,120
yes overexpressed in a tumor but are

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,360
also expressed in healthy tissues in the

86
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,800
body somewhere. And those anti-drug

87
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,879
conjugates conjugates will go to those

88
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,800
healthy cells and deliver highly

89
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,879
cytotoxic payloads and cause off-site

90
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,120
toxicity. So while both of these are

91
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,319
powerful that neither is perfect.

92
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,959
There's no sort of magic bullet yet. And

93
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,560
um several years ago actually about 15

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,440
years ago or so I started to think about

95
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,560
the question of how to combine these two

96
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,239
mechanistic paradigms. So utilize both

97
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,319
mechanism of action and delivery based

98
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,319
therapeutic windows to generate more

99
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,080
effective and safer cancer therapies. So

100
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,480
what do I mean by that? What I mean was

101
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,640
why can't we use payloads that have an

102
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,840
inherent mechanism of action bias for a

103
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,599
disease cell in the context of say an

104
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,319
antibbody drug conjugate where we bias

105
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,599
their delivery to target cells

106
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,040
such that in a sort of very

107
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:06,000
simple-minded way. Every molecule that

108
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,599
makes its way to the cancer cell brings

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,840
a drug molecule to that cell that's

110
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,920
really good at killing that cell. And

111
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,519
every molecule that doesn't bring that

112
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,439
molec every ADC molecule that doesn't

113
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,040
ever arrive at the target cell is

114
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,880
carrying a payload that based on its

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,600
mechanism of action is less effective at

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,800
killing a healthy cell. Right? So you

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,240
could think about sort of multiplying

118
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,080
these two therapeutic windows together

119
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,160
in principle. And it seems kind of like

120
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,000
an obvious thing to do. So you have to

121
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
ask yourself why isn't this why isn't

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,320
this done? And um you can survey the

123
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,040
literature and this really nice review

124
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,040
article from Daichi Sanchio that was

125
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,479
published a few years ago I think was

126
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,280
very inspiring to me at sort of pointing

127
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,880
at a direction for why this is the case.

128
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,320
So if you look at ADCs today, I mean

129
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,080
there are hundreds in clinical trials

130
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,000
and you know thousands that have been

131
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,520
studied academically and a few dozen in

132
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,360
clinically approved, but those

133
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,560
clinically approved ones basically

134
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,720
utilize three or four different fairly

135
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,199
fairly small number of different payload

136
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,400
mechanisms of action. And even though

137
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,560
some of the structures are different,

138
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,160
you know, the DNA damagers or topicase

139
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,160
inhibitors, they um carry have one thing

140
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,560
in common, which is that they're

141
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,840
extremely potent molecules. So this

142
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,360
summarizes essentially um or classifies

143
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,639
different payloads that have been tested

144
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,600
in the context of ADCs by their free

145
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,400
payload potency. And what was found that

146
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,880
you know drugs that are say subs

147
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,520
singledigit nanomar potency have been

148
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,759
successful in the clinic and drugs that

149
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,080
have you know are lower potency above

150
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,199
that singledigit nanomar potency have

151
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,120
not been successful in the clinic. And

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,560
um and so they the authors conclude that

153
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,720
the payloads of early ADCs are not

154
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,960
sufficiently effective and that one of

155
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,600
the big I mean you know holy grails of

156
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,120
this of the ADC field is to be able to

157
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,560
develop new payloads and expand the

158
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,720
mechanisms of action because again right

159
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,360
now there's only you there's less than a

160
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,080
than a handful of available mechanisms

161
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,320
of action for these constructs.

162
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,840
All right. So long story short we want

163
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,120
to enable molecularly targeted

164
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,960
therapeutics. Well what's the problem?

165
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,960
Well, it turns out that most of those

166
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,960
drugs fall on this side of the potency

167
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,880
scale. It's really hard for chemists to

168
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,039
make things that are, you know, subnanal

169
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,880
or picomar toxicity. That's very very

170
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,880
rare. And so when one finds one, it can

171
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,039
be a good ADC payload, but they tend to

172
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,639
not be extremely selective, right? So

173
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,639
they're really good at killing, but

174
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,960
maybe they don't have the mechanism of

175
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,240
actionbased uh therapeutic window that

176
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,479
some of the molecularly targeted drugs

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,240
have. Okay, so this leads to a question.

178
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,039
If we want to use a payload that's say

179
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,280
one or two orders of magnitude less

180
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,560
potent than these ones currently used

181
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,319
with ADCs, what could we do? Well, um

182
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,639
you might say, well, if I have an

183
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,199
antibbody here and let's say I have a

184
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,759
drug to antibbody ratio of eight, so I

185
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,280
have eight molecules of of the payload

186
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,880
per antibbody and you know, let's say a

187
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,240
given dose is effective, but I now I

188
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,599
want to use a payload that's 10 times

189
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,680
less potent. Well, I could just dose 10

190
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,199
times more. That's one possibility,

191
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,440
right? You just increase how much you

192
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,880
give by a factor of 10. There are

193
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,479
challenges to doing that, just simply

194
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,919
dosing 10 times more of an antibbody

195
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,080
drug conjugate. There's cost, there's

196
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,840
viscosity, and other issues. But I think

197
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,240
um it's also been shown and there's some

198
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,919
really nice recent um reviews on this

199
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,520
topic that uh by by doing a meta

200
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,680
analysis of all the clinically available

201
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,080
data, it's now known that all clinically

202
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,840
approved ADCs are dosed in a pretty

203
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,280
narrow range anywhere between 1 to 10

204
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,360
milligrams per kilogram of the ADC.

205
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,199
And what why is that? And certainly

206
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,039
certainly ADCs have tried like some of

207
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,039
the very very earliest ones were dosed

208
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,880
at 20 mix per higher doses than that. it

209
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,880
had some less potent payloads and they

210
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,360
weren't very effective. All right, so

211
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,280
why is this the case? Well, it's the the

212
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,120
thinking is that first on the low end,

213
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,319
we can't go much lower than 1 milligram

214
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,400
per kilogram. Uh because what happens is

215
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,080
antigens expressed in the pervascular

216
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,680
region sort of around the tumor right

217
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,440
where the antibi drug conjugate would

218
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,280
extravagate from the blood vessel and

219
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,479
enter the tumor. Now there's a high

220
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,759
density of antigens and all the

221
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,280
molecules would just bind there on the

222
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,759
surface and they can't go in they can't

223
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,360
penetrate into the tumor. Right? So it's

224
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,720
thought that maybe above 1 milligram per

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,479
kilogram you get into the range where

226
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,639
you can saturate the tumor periphery and

227
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,199
then have enough extra molecules to go

228
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,280
in. But you then can say well why not go

229
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,360
above 10 migs per kig. And aside from

230
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,960
the you know dosing challenges and cost

231
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,199
and things of that nature there is

232
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,280
evidence to suggest that at at much

233
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,440
higher doses you start to saturate tumor

234
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,680
antigens and then all the excess

235
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,519
molecules are just essentially like

236
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
unargeted nano particles that can

237
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,959
distribute around the body. And so you

238
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,200
don't actually gain more efficacy. you

239
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,200
get a little bit more toxicity by dosing

240
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,039
more. So this suggests that if you want

241
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,399
to use a 10 times less potent payload,

242
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,839
we can't just dose 10 times more because

243
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,680
we'll be in a regime where maybe we've

244
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,399
saturated tumors, the drug will no

245
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,080
longer be effective. Um, one other

246
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,880
interesting thing to note and this is

247
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,440
guides us when we think about what doses

248
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,360
to use in our pre-clinical studies is

249
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,200
when we start off with a new ADC

250
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,200
payload, one one that's not currently

251
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,120
established with ADCs, we can ask

252
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,440
ourselves, well, what payload dose

253
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,279
should we start with? And I and I when I

254
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,279
first started on this, I thought, well,

255
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,279
you know, let's say we we know a drug is

256
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,040
toxic at 10 migs per kick, but if I

257
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,880
attach it to an antibbody, I would

258
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,800
expect I could maybe dose more than that

259
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,920
because now I'm selecting where it goes,

260
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,360
right? Right? And so maybe I get those

261
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,040
20 mics per kick. But in fact, that

262
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,360
hasn't been borne out. And the really

263
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,560
nice uh review from last year has shown

264
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,800
that in fact ADCs don't usually display

265
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,160
higher maximum tolerated doses. You just

266
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,080
can't dose more. And that's because

267
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,640
ultimately the same amount of drug gets

268
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,320
exposed to the body. So what is

269
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,720
recommended is instead that you start

270
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,600
with if if you know the maximum

271
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,000
tolerable dose of your free payload, you

272
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,920
should use the same thing on a payload

273
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,640
basis in your new ADC. So you shouldn't

274
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,800
try to go above what's a known clinical

275
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,320
dose. So with all that information, what

276
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,560
we can say is, well, if we take payloads

277
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,320
where we know a maximum tolerable dose,

278
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,399
but we know that they're 10 to 100 times

279
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,560
less potent than ADC payloads, maybe we

280
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,760
could think of a way to incorporate that

281
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,480
many of these payload molecules onto a

282
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,399
single antibbody. Right? So, and by the

283
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,760
way, here here are the um titles of

284
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,680
these two articles that I I highly

285
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,320
recommend. Neither from my gra my group,

286
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,880
but they're uh I think really really

287
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,240
give a nice summary of the field. All

288
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,160
right. So, then back to this question,

289
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,920
what what can we do? I already said I I

290
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,800
think I showed that we can't just dose

291
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,399
10 times more. So, the other option is

292
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,399
if we want to keep the antibbody dose

293
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,839
the same and use a 10 times less potent

294
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,040
payload, we need to have 10 times more

295
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,399
molecules per antibbody, right? And so

296
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,320
we need to increase the drug to

297
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,079
antibbody ratio by a factor of 10 or by

298
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,399
a factor of 100. And I want to make that

299
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,000
really clear like I'm not proposing to

300
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,360
do that with existing antibbody

301
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,120
payloads. It's not necessary. They're

302
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,279
potent enough. In fact, you could maybe

303
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,360
use even less of them. But if you want

304
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,760
to use payloads that aren't that potent,

305
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,920
I you you may not have any other choice,

306
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,120
right? And so how could you do that? How

307
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,399
could we make ADCs that still function

308
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,880
yet have 10 or 100 times more payloads?

309
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,560
And of course, um, you know, you you

310
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,959
can't just Oh, it looks like my slide

311
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,920
advancer is

312
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,720
dying on me.

313
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,880
Ah, let's go back. Okay. Um, you you

314
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,959
can't just attach 10 times more payloads

315
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,160
to an antibbody because, as you might

316
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,560
imagine, that's going to disrupt the

317
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,000
antibbody function, right? Um, usually

318
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,000
these conjugations are done to either

319
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,160
cysteine residues or lysine residues.

320
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,560
you know, you've got 80 if you wanted to

321
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,839
do 10 times more than 80 lines, you

322
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,120
could functionalize, but if you do that,

323
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,040
you're going to make a big hydrophobic

324
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,560
blob, right? And this is not going to

325
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,600
function.

326
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,440
Uh so we started to think about how to

327
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
overcome that problem and several years

328
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,200
ago thought about well what if we

329
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,920
instead of attaching a bunch of payloads

330
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,959
to an antibbody um develop some kind of

331
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:59,519
rigid backbone that we could string

332
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:02,320
along several payloads and linkers onto

333
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,560
that backbone and only couple that onto

334
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,920
a single side of the antibody. thus

335
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,720
effectively only functionalizing the

336
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,480
antibody once and then having whatever

337
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,560
the drug to antibody ratio that we

338
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,279
desire tied to this this string.

339
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,120
This has also been tried before. Um, and

340
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,560
it's faced a lot of struggles. And you

341
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,279
can imagine one of the struggles being

342
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,880
that, you know, just like if we put 80

343
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,320
payloads on an antibbody, we start to

344
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,480
disrupt its function because payload

345
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,360
molecules tend to be a little bit

346
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,880
hydrophobic. Um, and you know, they can

347
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,160
cause aggregation. They can disrupt

348
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,240
antibody function. Well, if you put 80

349
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,680
hydrophobic payloads on a long chain

350
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,279
attached to an antibody, it's also

351
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,279
probably going to present problems,

352
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,720
right? Aggregation uh, and things of

353
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,360
that nature. And in fact the the

354
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,880
attempts to do this previously

355
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,680
the only way people could get them to

356
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,320
work was put maybe 10 to 20 kilodolton

357
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,760
of space between each drug and linker.

358
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,720
So this is drawn like they're very close

359
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,800
together but imagine like 20 kilodolton

360
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,560
of hydrophilic space between each drug

361
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,639
just to give enough hydrophilicity for

362
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,480
these to stay soluble. And thus the drug

363
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,399
to antibody ratios achieved were on the

364
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,079
order of say 10 to 20 not a factor of 10

365
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,480
not an order of magnitude. So all that

366
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,240
work to get maybe a doubling of the DAR

367
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,279
isn't going to open a completely new

368
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,839
payload space. So the idea that we came

369
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,079
up with actually about again quite some

370
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,000
time ago was to think well instead of

371
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,079
having a link one linker and one payload

372
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,959
for every repeat unit. What if we also

373
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,760
installed a branch point at each repeat

374
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,800
unit with a hydrophilic side chain here

375
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,040
shown in cartoon in blue such that for

376
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,480
every payload and drug and every payload

377
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,959
and linker you have this little blue

378
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,040
chain and the little blue chain would

379
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,320
extend just beyond the payload and

380
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,480
linker almost like a coaxial cable kind

381
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,079
of shielding the middle part with this

382
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,600
external

383
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,680
blue hydrophilic region. And if one

384
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,360
could do that, then in principle it

385
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,199
would allow you to make an arbitrarily

386
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,920
long

387
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,079
uh polymer chain, it would allow you to

388
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,519
use whatever payloads and linkers that

389
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,880
you want because their physical

390
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,160
properties would actually be decoupled

391
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,079
from the physical properties of the

392
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,639
overall structure because again that

393
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,399
would be dominated by these blue chains

394
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,399
and perhaps you could address this

395
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,000
problem. So I'm going to focus on just

396
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,000
this blue multicolored cartoon here. If

397
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,680
you if you look at this structure and

398
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,440
you've ever used a bottle brush, you

399
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,199
sort of clean out a bottle with a metal

400
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,440
thing with little spikes coming out of

401
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,000
it. A bottle brush. Well, in the field

402
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,800
of uh of polymer science, we call these

403
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,639
molecules bottle brush polymers because

404
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,440
they look like bottle brushes at the

405
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,720
nanocale. And so we coined this term

406
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,480
bottle brush prod

407
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,959
uh to describe this portion of this

408
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,720
molecule. Um, and we think that they

409
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,360
could enable novel ADC payloads and

410
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,920
payload combinations if they can be

411
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,279
made. And so when I started my lab now

412
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,720
again quite some time ago, the first

413
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,800
question was how to even make molecules

414
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,440
like this because molecules like this

415
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,279
were not known in the literature. Um but

416
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,680
we thought they could represent a

417
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,040
powerful new platform for therapeutics

418
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,639
that could have advantages and sort of

419
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,560
orthogonal functions compared to other

420
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,959
things like liposomaal nanoparticles and

421
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,880
and dendrs and other kinds of uh

422
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,440
conjugates or nanoparticle platforms

423
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,639
that are out there. So how do we make

424
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,639
this? I'm going to skip over lots and

425
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,480
lots and lots of work and graduate

426
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,440
student and posttock time. just

427
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,839
highlight our most recent which is still

428
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,800
old but the way we we make this platform

429
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,560
molecule today a former student now a

430
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,160
professor at Dartmouth Hong Nuen

431
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,880
developed this very simple three-step

432
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,920
synthesis to this platform molecule that

433
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,320
in two additional uh one pot steps can

434
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,880
access this molecule in blue and what

435
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,800
this is is uh I'll break down it's got

436
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,120
three major components one is a a

437
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,240
normine I'll talk about what that is for

438
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,360
in a it. But the key part is this

439
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,759
tertiary amide with a terminal alkine.

440
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,160
And here I show a 3 kilodolton

441
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,800
polyethylene glycol chain which is what

442
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,959
we use for what what we will use for all

443
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,560
the studies I'll show you today although

444
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,160
we you know we've published many papers

445
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,160
on changing what this is and various

446
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,839
other things. So what this what this

447
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,079
molecule effectively is is a peg chain

448
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,480
with a branch point and this norbborine

449
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,680
and the branch connects to an alkine and

450
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:31,120
what that alkine what we can do is take

451
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:34,160
essentially any uh payload molecule we

452
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,800
want and we've used small molecules

453
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,880
mediumsiz molecules like protax we've

454
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,040
used oligos we've used peptides there's

455
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,680
a number of I mean this can be almost

456
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,560
anything and and what we do next is we

457
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,360
we do some kind of medicinal chemistry

458
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,639
in a sense we we append onto that

459
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,079
molecule a linker here shown in green

460
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,079
I'll show some examples I mean these can

461
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,680
be any traditional ADC linker or any

462
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,680
other kind of cleavable bond that we

463
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,120
want and then we have an aid group and

464
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,800
with that aid group in the presence of

465
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,760
copper one we can do an aid alkine

466
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,400
cycllo addition reaction aka a click

467
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,480
chemistry reaction and very simply

468
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,120
conjugate that molecule to that alkine

469
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,679
to make this what we call the branched

470
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:18,000
macro monomer where there's a payload a

471
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,160
cleavl linker and a peg chain. And then

472
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,799
in with this molecule that contains all

473
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,280
the functional components that we want,

474
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,039
we can do a polymerization reaction

475
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,240
using what's called the grubs third

476
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,840
generation um complex, which I won't

477
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,240
bother going into those details right

478
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,360
now. But by simply controlling the ratio

479
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,520
of this molecule to this one, we can

480
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,720
polymerize through this norbborine to

481
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,720
grow this this purple backbone to make

482
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,480
these bottle brush pro drugs of whatever

483
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,799
length and dimensions that we want them

484
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,080
to be. All right. And again by

485
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,600
controlling the length of this we are

486
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,360
directly controlling what the drug to

487
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,039
antibbody ratio would be once we

488
00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,880
conjugate this onto an antibbody. Right?

489
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,720
So uh this very simple platform we've

490
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,880
been studying this for quite some time

491
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,360
no antibodies involved just showing how

492
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,440
we can make things like this. This is a

493
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,760
short list and we've got many many more

494
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,440
to add that of just some of the payloads

495
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,640
that we've used some of the little gray

496
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,480
spheres. you know, started off with kind

497
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,520
of chemotherapeutics and have looked at

498
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,960
epigenetic regulators and immune uh

499
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,000
stimulants and protax and you know these

500
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,960
gray spheres can also be imaging agents.

501
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,440
We've made uh MRI contrast agents using

502
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,240
this technology. It can be almost

503
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,799
anything and also the green linkers can

504
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,640
be almost anything. For example, we've

505
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,000
taken some compounds like be bromine

506
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,720
inhibitors and we've made 10 different

507
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,320
linkers to compare head-to-head 10

508
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,679
different BPDs that are identical in

509
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,799
every way, size, and shape and

510
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,160
everything, but they just differ by the

511
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,840
linker, the mechanism for the drug

512
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,720
release. So, we can investigate its

513
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,280
impact uh selectively.

514
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,520
All right. Um, now this one of the

515
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,760
things I I'm really think is unique

516
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,000
about this system is just how

517
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,039
reproducibly it can be synthesized and

518
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,960
how its physical properties are truly

519
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,960
independent really of what the payload

520
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,720
we're using is, which is part of a

521
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,760
design idea, but it turns out to be

522
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,200
true. This is just a few examples of

523
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,480
some data. Size exclusion,

524
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,160
chromatography, and dynamic light

525
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,000
scattering. Two ways we can measure the

526
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:28,000
size of these objects. And um what I'm

527
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
overlaying here is six different BPDs.

528
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,880
Uh the top three, so black, red, and

529
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,840
blue have different payloads. The sin

530
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,760
and ant are actually BPDs that have

531
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,240
synergistic and antagonistic

532
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,400
combinations of three drugs incorporated

533
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,080
within them. So one thing I I didn't

534
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,640
mention, but you can imagine is if I can

535
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,480
make a drug conjugated macro monomer and

536
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,160
I just polymerize it. Well, if I want to

537
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,000
make a BPD that has two drugs, I can

538
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,840
make two drug-loaded macro monomers and

539
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,280
pyrize one and then plyize the other.

540
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,640
And if I want to have three, I can just

541
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,240
take three drug loaded macro and

542
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,760
pummerize them together. So, I can take

543
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,160
essentially any ratio of different

544
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,440
molecules that you might want and build

545
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,200
them into a BPD quite quite quickly and

546
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,120
know in advance that that that the

547
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,039
physical properties like size, shape,

548
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,640
solubility, and everything are not going

549
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,160
to be a function of what the ratio of

550
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,080
those drugs is or even what those drugs

551
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,320
are, which I think is quite unique. I'm

552
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,000
not sure that there's any other uh

553
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,919
nanoparticle type of technology that

554
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,280
could do that. So here you see from size

555
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,720
exclusion chromatography all six of

556
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,840
these are essentially indistinguishable

557
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,600
by dynamic light scattering. They're all

558
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,080
essentially identical size. Their

559
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,520
average uh hydrodnamic diameter is about

560
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:38,720
10 nanometers which is similar to um a

561
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,360
monoconal antibbody 10 to 15 or so. Um

562
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,799
and then here's a a cryeleron microscopy

563
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,559
image of just one of these just to show

564
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,880
an example but they are approximately 10

565
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,360
nanometer particles.

566
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,880
Uh so with that as the background of

567
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,400
BPDs

568
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,679
the big question is then how do you take

569
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,480
a BPD which is like a antibbody sized

570
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,159
synthetic polymer carrying however many

571
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,320
drugs we want and how do we attach that

572
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,480
to an an antibbody which is an antibbody

573
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,600
sized nanoparticle. uh they're both

574
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,679
about 10 to 15 nanometers in size and

575
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,440
such chemical reactions are not trivial

576
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,320
try to take two relatively large objects

577
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,559
and bring them together um and we you

578
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,840
can do this a number of ways potentially

579
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,000
but uh we recently found uh one that's

580
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,440
quite effective and this is work done by

581
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,919
Benlu a former posttock in the lab and

582
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,840
and what he realized is that when we

583
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,320
grow these polymers using olphin

584
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,480
metaththesis polymerization the end of

585
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,760
the polymer has ruthenium carbon double

586
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,520
bond. And what we usually do is we

587
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,880
quench that and we we throw away the

588
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,840
ruthenium and we just use the polymer.

589
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,960
We don't want that there. Um but uh what

590
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,320
you can actually do instead of just

591
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,440
quenching it and throwing away is you

592
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,080
can use this as as a useful site to

593
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,840
attach exactly one

594
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,480
click chemistry handle in this case a uh

595
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,559
a tetraine which is what this thing is

596
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,360
over here. And so by adding this

597
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,400
molecule one to this polymerization you

598
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,159
don't have to do anything else. You grow

599
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,320
the polymer, you add this molecule and

600
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,320
it clips off the rathenium and attaches

601
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,559
instead this tetraine onto the chain

602
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,000
end. And uh in case you haven't haven't

603
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,880
seen this before, tetrazines are really

604
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,960
really useful functional groups for

605
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,360
doing a a reaction called an inverse

606
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,080
electron demand deals alder reaction

607
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,919
which is also one of the of the family

608
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,679
of reactions called click reactions.

609
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,120
It's actually the most efficient of them

610
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,039
that has the highest second order rate

611
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,520
constants and things of that nature. And

612
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,840
and indeed we can take this with a

613
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,000
single tetraine on the end and make an

614
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,000
antibbody that has the corresponding

615
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
reaction partner called the transcyllo

616
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,440
octene. And this can be installed

617
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,960
through any traditional antibbody

618
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,320
functionalization

619
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,640
protocol you know lysene amidation

620
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,120
cysteine you know alpha beta alpha beta

621
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,120
saturated carbonial conjugate addition

622
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,880
whatever whatever we'd like. And we

623
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,559
simply mix these two things together and

624
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,960
we induce this click coupling reaction

625
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,919
that forms our antibbody bottle brush

626
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,360
conjugate. Okay, there's no clock up

627
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,080
here. So let me see where I Okay, I've

628
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,080
got some time. Uh,

629
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,280
all right. So now I'm going to uh

630
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,880
transition to showing you some of the

631
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,679
data from this. This paper actually just

632
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,760
came out um about a month or so ago. And

633
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,320
in this paper we describe we synthesize

634
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,360
and describe over 10 different ABCs

635
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,480
highlighting I think really the

636
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,280
modularity of this system. Um here are

637
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,120
examples of payloads that we used. Uh

638
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,360
doc rubicon do rubeson you know kind of

639
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,600
a classical chemotherapy. Um but

640
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,440
actually you know it's a topo isomease 2

641
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,760
inhibitor which is a mechanism of action

642
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,000
not known in ADC world. So topo one

643
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,640
inhibitors are really really popular. Uh

644
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,880
topo two inhibitors not yet established

645
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,760
to to to work well in at least in the

646
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,640
clinic. Um one reason is because Dr.

647
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,280
Rubson's about 10fold less potent than

648
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,799
the best ADC payloads out there. So we

649
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,280
have this in the library. We also have

650
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,400
SN38 which is a which is a established

651
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,919
payload in Troeli. Um we have a topo one

652
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,039
inhibitor by the way. We have we have

653
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,520
pletaxel. So taxel microtubial inhibitor

654
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,080
but unlike you know MMA which is now in

655
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,679
the sub singledigit nanomar potency.

656
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,400
This one is much less potent and not

657
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,400
successful in ADCs yet widely used in

658
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,919
the clinic for various types of cancers.

659
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,720
We have ARV771 a betron domain uh well

660
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,760
actually a BRD4 degrader. So this is a

661
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,159
protac molecule. Um and we also have

662
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,400
just SCI 5.5 as a floro near infrared

663
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,480
florore that we can image uh and we can

664
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,840
combine these mix and match them to do

665
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:39,200
simultaneous imaging and and and uh drug

666
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,919
delivery as we want. All right. So um

667
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,360
here's a a TEM image of some of these

668
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,520
actual ABCs. again confirming I mean if

669
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,520
you take a roughly 10 nanometer object

670
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,200
and couple it to another 10 nanometer

671
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,120
object you should get something that's

672
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,039
on the order of you know 20 nanometers

673
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,000
but two spheres together and if you look

674
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,600
really carefully and these are not

675
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,799
oriented in any specific way but if you

676
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,840
pick some of these you can actually see

677
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,600
two blobs connected to each other um and

678
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,720
they're all very uniform in their in

679
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,960
their size um and very small I want to

680
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,559
emphasize that you know people use the

681
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,360
word nanoparticle a lot and sort of

682
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,279
generically u but nanoparticles span you

683
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,440
know, two to three orders of magnitude

684
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,039
of size. And here we're on the, you

685
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,279
know, our nanoparticles, our our bottle

686
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,360
brushes are on the size scale of a

687
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,080
protein, right? Which is a small nano

688
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,279
particle um compared to say like an L&P

689
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,279
which is more like a 100 nanometers,

690
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:33,039
another order of magnitude up. Okay. Uh

691
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,640
one obvious question is if you conjugate

692
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,960
this big thing to an antibody, does it

693
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,080
disrupt the function of the antibbody?

694
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,440
Uh the good news is it it does not. Um

695
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,360
first here what I'm showing are uh gels

696
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,039
uh comparing so of course we use

697
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,039
trstusmab in the data I'm going to show

698
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,600
you today of course we can take almost

699
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,760
any antibbody that we want or peptide or

700
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,000
antibbody fragment but most of the data

701
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,480
in this paper focuses on just trstuzzmab

702
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,880
because of its clinical importance and

703
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,880
for comparison to other clinical ADCs.

704
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,440
So here in this lane is an ABC with a

705
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,960
DAR of 60 and here's a DAR of 120. So

706
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,880
we're getting to this you know really

707
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,000
increasing the DAR by a order of

708
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:17,039
magnitude or two but even there we get

709
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,159
by by microscale thermopheresis by um uh

710
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,000
by u SPR analysis and every method we

711
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,080
can measure for looking at antibbody

712
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,400
binding affinity we don't substantially

713
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,200
disrupt it compared to trstismab or

714
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:33,840
kadsyla or enheru which are other

715
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:37,360
trstismab based um herto binding ADCs by

716
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,880
flcytometry we see that the RABC shows a

717
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,760
couple of order orders of magnitude

718
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,440
greater cell binding compared to an IGG1

719
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,039
version. So an antibbody bottle brush

720
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,279
conjugate conjugated to IGG1 that

721
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,679
doesn't target anything or the bottle

722
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,880
brush polymer by itself which we good we

723
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,640
don't expect to have any cell

724
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,919
selectivity or targeting. Um, and this

725
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,120
series of confocal fluorescent

726
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,480
microscopy images shows you uh cell

727
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,679
binding and uptake, which you probably I

728
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,320
don't even know if you'll be able to see

729
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:08,240
it here, but but what this is is a an

730
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:12,159
ABC that contains SN38 as a payload and

731
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,080
SCI 5.5 is a die. So this the SCI 5.5 is

732
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,440
is coalently attached to the bottle

733
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,159
brush. So it tells us where the bottle

734
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,760
brush is. SN38 is a fluorescent small

735
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,080
molecule that once it's released, you

736
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,559
can see where it goes. And so four hours

737
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,720
after exposing cells her two positive

738
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,720
cells to an ABC targeting her two that

739
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,799
has these two molecules you see red

740
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,480
fluorescent just around the periphery of

741
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,720
the cells suggesting that we've bound to

742
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,960
the outside of the cells and if you look

743
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,559
a day later most of that red fluoresence

744
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,880
has moved inside of the cells into

745
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,840
punctates suggesting that we're now in

746
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,320
endoomes or loss and you already start

747
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,080
to see strong blue fluoresence in the

748
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,840
nuclei of some of these cells. If you

749
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,200
look a little bit later, even more the

750
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,039
blue and the red fluoresence are

751
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,279
starting to not collocicalize with each

752
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,120
other because the SN38 is being released

753
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:00,080
whereas the red part is staying on the

754
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,480
bottle brush, right? And so what this is

755
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,240
directly showing is cell binding uptake

756
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,760
and then release and the payload going

757
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,720
to the nucleus where it can do its job

758
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,720
as a topo isomease one inhibitor which

759
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,399
um you know this just highlights that we

760
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,960
can being able to put an imaging agent

761
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,640
and a payload into one ADC like

762
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,840
construct allows us to do this kind of

763
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,559
mechanistic um analysis.

764
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,520
Um we've done a lot of invivo studies

765
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,520
and preclinical murine models of uh of

766
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,120
cancer and I'm just going to highlight a

767
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,440
few of those here. This paper has lot

768
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,880
lots of data in it but this is one of

769
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:38,320
our first studies using a DAR 135

770
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,480
uh ABC and if we compare you know

771
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,240
animals given just saline vehicle

772
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:47,200
control um our BPD and our ABC IGG1

773
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,679
variant so it's a non-binding control

774
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,760
have some efficacy because again we are

775
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,360
dosing a nanoparticle-based prod drug

776
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,360
this some of this molecule accumulates

777
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,039
in the tumor and some of it shows an

778
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,960
effect but compared to that tumor

779
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:03,840
targeting ABC uh in this case we achieve

780
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,000
you know 100% survival and out to um

781
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,880
almost you know getting close to a year

782
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,200
these mice are fine with no sign of the

783
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,039
tumor uh recurring either you know

784
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,480
visually or by histologology and I want

785
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,320
to note that this is done at a dose of

786
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,919
monoconal antibbody of five migs per kig

787
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,799
which is within the 1 to 10 migs per kig

788
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,520
range and that amounts to a dose of 1.1

789
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,279
migs per kick of SN38 which is within

790
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,760
what's already given of SN38 in the

791
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,440
clinic right in the form of urinican or

792
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,240
liposomaal arenkin or even in the case

793
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,840
of tbelvi. So these are doses that are

794
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,000
very you know already acceptable for

795
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,840
clinical use and we're getting this sort

796
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,440
of efficacy.

797
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,159
Um [sighs and gasps]

798
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,919
we've done head-to-head studies with

799
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,679
kadila. I don't have those data here but

800
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,919
I've I've showing that you know the even

801
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,520
more the better ADC even is no offense

802
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:54,159
if you make kila but TDXD and her two

803
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,320
which is a really amazing heru targeted

804
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,640
drug. It works incredibly well in her

805
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,399
two positive cancers. It also works in

806
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,640
her two low cancers and it's maybe even

807
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,520
approved in her two negative cancers.

808
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,200
Kind of works. It's like magic. Um part

809
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,600
of that is because it's a nanoparticle

810
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,159
carrying a drug which is a discussion I

811
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,919
could I will try to stay on on topic

812
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,760
here. But um what we see is that

813
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:20,240
comparing TDXD which is an HERU

814
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:23,120
biosimilar to our SN38 heru targeted ABC

815
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,520
and HER2 positive BT474

816
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,440
uh tumor model. Uh and this in this case

817
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,039
in our hands we get sort of stasis or

818
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,440
slight regression with both of these

819
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:35,120
drugs. But what's interesting is that in

820
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:38,720
HCC70 which is a herto

821
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,840
ultra low herto expression where TDXD is

822
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,240
sort of the level of expression that

823
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,200
it's actually clinically approved. we do

824
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,679
get better efficacy um at the same

825
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,600
antibbody dose and and part of the

826
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,320
reason why or at least we hypothesize is

827
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,240
that in low antigen expressing cancers

828
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,159
having more drug molecules per antibbody

829
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,159
can facilitate higher efficacy because

830
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,840
for every binding event and a molecule

831
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,679
is taken into the cell you're able to

832
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,880
deliver more of those drugs it's a

833
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,520
little bit apples and oranges here

834
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,240
though because we're using SN38 and TDXD

835
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,159
uses exatkin which is actually or

836
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,320
actually DXD but it's a a derivative of

837
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,200
XTK and and it's actually a much more

838
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,279
potent and more stable drug. So we're

839
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,960
SN38 is not quite as good as it even

840
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,960
though we because of our higher DAR we

841
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,440
can outperform it. Okay. Um I'll wrap up

842
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,000
here very soon. I showed you doc rubeson

843
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,520
again. Dr. Rubeson not effective in not

844
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,640
potent enough to be used in clinical

845
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,880
ADCs but by having a DAR of 135 we can

846
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,120
sort of completely clear tumors. Again

847
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,360
uh these are xenographs in mice but

848
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,279
similar story at a dose of antibbody

849
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,960
that's very manageable and a 1.9 mix per

850
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,519
kick of dox rubin is already given in

851
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,960
the clinic uh in the form of doxil which

852
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:52,320
is a liposomaal docubit

853
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,039
um and results that look like this for

854
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,480
protax uh for other payloads and also

855
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,399
for different antibodies. So we don't

856
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,080
have to only use her too. We can use in

857
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,360
this case mukawan is also described in

858
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,480
this paper and we've used several others

859
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,360
in unpublished work. So I'm going to end

860
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,679
there uh thanking the NIH and the

861
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,960
American Cancer Society in Yusede for

862
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,440
funding um this work um as well as the

863
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Koch Institute of which I'm a extramural

864
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,360
faculty member and we use a lot of the

865
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,440
resources there. I'll also mention that

866
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,720
um a few years ago along with a couple

867
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,799
of my students we spun out a company

868
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,919
called Window Therapeutics that is

869
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,159
working to bring these kinds of

870
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,000
molecules to the clinic. So with that

871
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,577
I'll happy to take any questions. Thank

872
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,597
you.

873
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:34,597
[applause]

874
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,760
>> Questions for Jeremiah.

875
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,960
>> Thank you so much for the uh great talk.

876
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,640
um uh if I understand it correctly um

877
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,760
well I'm not sure you have already

878
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:55,120
mentioned about this um you conjugated

879
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,240
the die with the preload and then you

880
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:02,080
monitor the die to see you know uh as a

881
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,640
as as a marker how the cell process like

882
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:08,720
intake and transport the payload and

883
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,360
eventually release. My question is um is

884
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,679
there any way to confirm really what you

885
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,760
see is not just the die?

886
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,679
>> Yeah, good question. So it's a not it's

887
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,360
not quite what what you said though and

888
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,080
I'm sorry I didn't make this very clear

889
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:26,720
and I went through it very quickly. Um

890
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:30,960
so maybe if I go back. So I said

891
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,960
in this section so we have ABC bound

892
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,440
die. What I mean by this is this is

893
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,120
attached to our our bottle brush polymer

894
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,080
but it's attached through a non-

895
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,960
cleavable linker. So the die molecule

896
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,000
cannot leave the bottle brush.

897
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,519
SN38 yes it's a potent topo isomerase

898
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,519
one inhibitor but it also happens to be

899
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:54,480
fluorescent. So when it releases we see

900
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,720
this molecule as blue fluoresence

901
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,960
and the red fluoresence is is is marking

902
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,880
the brush. Yeah. So at the starting

903
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,640
point they collocicalize because the

904
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,279
drug is attached. Once the drug is

905
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,399
released you get red in some regions and

906
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,440
blue in other regions and that's because

907
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,440
they've separated.

908
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,200
>> Does that make sense? Yeah.

909
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,480
>> Thank you for allowing me to clarify

910
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,919
that. Right.

911
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,480
>> No thanks.

912
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,480
>> Any other questions?

913
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:29,223
>> Thank you very much Jeremiah. Thank you.

914
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:29,223
