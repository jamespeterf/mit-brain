00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,839
Hello, this is Laura Hessie Fischer and

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,840
you're listening to Today I Learned

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,679
Climate from the Massachusetts Institute

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,200
of Technology.

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,160
Here's something that people ask us a

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,199
lot. Are we worried about the materials

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,520
that go into solar panels and batteries?

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,680
Sure, they help us head off the dangers

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,800
of climate change, but what if making

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,439
them pollutes our air or our water? And

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,439
yeah, we are worried about this. like to

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,160
name one important example. Many

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,480
batteries contain nickel and cobalt and

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,120
both of them are toxic metals that can

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,520
harm miners and the people who live near

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,160
the mines. But this got our team

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,440
thinking, why do we only hear these

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,640
questions about new energy technologies?

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,039
We shouldn't forget that our current

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,399
energy system, which depends primarily

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,199
on fossil fuels, causes serious health

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,280
effects because of the emissions of air

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,840
pollutants that are involved in the

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,920
combustion of those fuels. That's Dr.

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,600
Mary Rice. I'm the director of the

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,280
Center for Climate Health and the Global

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,760
Environment at the Harvard Chan School

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,159
of Public Health. And I'm also a

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,960
practicing pulmonologist at Beth Israel

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,040
Deaconist Medical Center in Boston. When

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,119
they're not treating patients, Dr. Rice

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,439
and her colleagues study what climate

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,960
change is doing to our health. And they

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,880
also study what the coal, oil, and gas

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,200
that cause climate change do to us. But

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,759
how big of a health problem are fossil

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,520
fuels really? After all, we've been

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,600
burning them for hundreds of years.

40
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,240
Wouldn't we notice by now if they were

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,280
harming us? I think we often don't

42
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,960
appreciate the harms because we're all

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,960
exposed. And so there's a tremendous

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,079
amount of death and illness around the

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,200
world due to air pollution exposure

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,799
that I think is really underappreciated.

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,280
So

48
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,360
I'd like to tell you a story about air

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,280
pollution and how the scientific

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,959
community realized how deadly it really

51
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,640
was.

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,040
In early December 1952, a cold fog

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,760
descended upon London. And because of

54
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,319
the cold, Londoners began to burn more

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,400
cold than usual. And at the same time,

56
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,640
the final conversion of London's

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,800
electronic trams to diesel buses was

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,120
completed. And the resulting air

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,040
pollution was trapped by a heavy layer

60
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,920
of cold air. The smog was so thick that

61
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,160
people actually couldn't even see. And

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,720
in the weeks that followed, the medical

63
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,560
services compiled statistics and found

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,040
that that fog had killed 4,000 people.

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,239
And another 8,000 people died in the

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,599
weeks and months that followed.

67
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,360
This became known as the Great Smog, and

68
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,680
it was one of the first times that

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,800
medical researchers looked at two

70
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,120
crucial pieces of data together. How

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,080
much smoke was in the air from burning

72
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,800
coal and diesel? and at the same time

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,280
how many people were dying of heart and

74
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,680
lung disease. And it turned out that

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,840
when the first line went up, the others

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,920
shot up right alongside it. And that

77
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,319
event in some ways was the beginning of

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,480
environmental epidemiology where the

79
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,560
researchers could look at the data and

80
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,560
make a clear link between pollution,

81
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,280
exposure, and death. We've now had over

82
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,040
70 years of public health research since

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,519
the Great Smog. And time and time again,

84
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,440
we found the same link. When people are

85
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,640
exposed to more air pollution from

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,640
fossil fuels, we get sicker.

87
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,840
But what exactly is it that makes us

88
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,920
sick? Well, burning coal, oil, and gas

89
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,319
can put lots of things into the air that

90
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,239
are unhealthy to breathe. Nitrogen

91
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,040
oxides, ozone, carbon monoxide. But the

92
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,400
most dangerous is what scientists call

93
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:09,200
fine particulate matter. And that means

94
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,439
little particles of carbon and metals

95
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,120
that are suspended into the air and can

96
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,000
be inhaled.

97
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,400
And they're small enough to be breathed

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,720
in all the way down into the alvolar

99
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,680
sacks, the part of the lung where gas

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,639
exchange takes place.

101
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,240
And in that area of the lung, the

102
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,880
particles cause inflammation,

103
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,520
irritation. Think about when you get a

104
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,560
splinter. Your skin gets inflamed,

105
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,600
right? You know, red, swollen. Now,

106
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,560
imagine that happening inside your lungs

107
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,960
day after day just from breathing in

108
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,960
dirty air.

109
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,759
And that inflammation has a spillover

110
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,280
effect into the rest of the body leading

111
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,840
to health effects in distant places. And

112
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,400
that explains why particulate matter

113
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,040
pollution has been linked to heart

114
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:06,160
disease, brain disease, cancer,

115
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:10,240
developmental uh delays in children,

116
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,720
cognitive health effects, uh changes in

117
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,520
pregnancy outcomes,

118
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,160
which are all illnesses that we see more

119
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,960
often in people who spend a lot of time

120
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,600
around fossil fuel pollution. certain

121
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,120
occupational groups are more heavily

122
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,520
exposed, right? So, if you work in the

123
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,000
transportation sector, you're exposed to

124
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,479
air pollution at your daily job. If

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,520
you're in manufacturing, exposure can be

126
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,880
quite high. Traffic pollution has also

127
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,759
been declared a carcinogen by the WHO

128
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,840
and that's in part due to evidence from

129
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,039
people in the trucking industry who were

130
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,520
heavily exposed to to traffic and had a

131
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,000
higher risk of lung cancer. Air

132
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,800
pollution from traffic can even affect

133
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,080
how kids think and learn.

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,280
A study in Massachusetts by my

135
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,479
colleagues found that uh kids who lived

136
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,199
within 50 meters from a major roadway

137
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,000
had lower non-verbal IQs and they

138
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,000
actually had a worse ability to do tasks

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,520
that require hand eye coordination

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,880
compared to kids who live further away

141
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,840
from roads. Then there are what we might

142
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,280
call environmental pollutants. So, these

143
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,759
are ones that can linger in the

144
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,759
environment for a long time, sometimes

145
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:33,199
with some particularly nasty impacts.

146
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,280
When coal is burned, sulfur dioxide is

147
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,759
released into the atmosphere. Sulfur

148
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,240
dioxide contributes to acid rain and to

149
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,520
to respiratory illnesses.

150
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,000
Coal also emits mercury and other heavy

151
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,080
metals into the atmosphere.

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,360
When you're pregnant, you learn that

153
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,600
mercury is a neurotoxin, which doctors

154
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,560
advise staying away from because of the

155
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,599
effects it can have on unborn babies.

156
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,199
And that mercury and other toxic metals

157
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:06,800
like lead can also wind up in water and

158
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,280
soil, especially near coal mines. The

159
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,759
use of coal and oil and gas creates

160
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,039
pollution at almost every step, well

161
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,240
before the fuels are actually burned.

162
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,280
fossil fuel extraction, refining, and

163
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,440
manufacturing of byproducts all have

164
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,000
emissions that are unhealthy for

165
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,479
communities and for workers.

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,840
And I mean, it's not hard to believe

167
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,479
that breathing thick clouds of coal dust

168
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,560
can't be good for you. But come on,

169
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,160
don't we have regulations to protect us

170
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:44,080
from that? Well, yeah, we do. Thanks to

171
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,240
policies like the 1970 Clean Air Act,

172
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,039
gas burning cars have catalytic

173
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,120
converters to filter out air pollutants

174
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,680
and coal and gas power plants have

175
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,840
devices called scrubbers that do the

176
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,879
same thing. The Clean Air Act of 1970

177
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:05,440
has been a real success story. It's been

178
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:08,720
estimated to avoid 230,000

179
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,440
deaths every year. Well, unfortunately,

180
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,919
there's no safe level of air pollution.

181
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,240
Almost every human on Earth, even in

182
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,520
wealthy countries, breathes air

183
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,440
pollution at levels that are unhealthy.

184
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,479
Wait, that can't be right, can it? I

185
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,479
mean, I care a lot about clean air. My

186
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,759
weather app has one of those like little

187
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,839
air quality trackers from the EPA, and

188
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,240
most days it says that my air quality is

189
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,719
is green. You know, it's good. On the

190
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,200
rare days, it's yellow. I might skip my

191
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,839
morning walk. Well, actually, what I

192
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,640
learned is that this tracker is focused

193
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,399
on levels of air pollution that might

194
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,360
make us sick within hours or days. It

195
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,760
does not show us the low levels that

196
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,240
might accumulate and contribute to

197
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,720
illness over years.

198
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,680
In the US, on the whole, we have

199
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,880
impressively clean air. But even in the

200
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,760
US, we are all exposed to a certain

201
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,200
amount of air pollution, even on those

202
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,360
good green days. For some of us, that

203
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,760
pollution can add up. And that

204
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,160
especially includes children, the

205
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,640
elderly, those with pre-existing

206
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,000
illnesses, and people who happen to live

207
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,920
or work in more polluted places. In the

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,880
US, poor neighborhoods often have a

209
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,200
higher density of traffic, more highways

210
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,040
that crisscross one another, poor

211
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,440
neighborhoods are more likely to have a

212
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,080
dense concentration of manufacturing.

213
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,560
So, there's differences based on the

214
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,000
neighborhoods people live in. Even if

215
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,519
you live in a neighborhood with clean

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,399
air, our morning commutes can expose us

217
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,200
to much higher levels of pollution.

218
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,760
A major health concern is diesel buses

219
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,560
because kids are exposed to air

220
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,720
pollution on their commutes to school.

221
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,320
As a pulmonologist, I worry a lot about

222
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,120
the respiratory health effects of air

223
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,440
pollution in kids.

224
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,760
Let's zoom out for a minute. We know

225
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,880
that being around fossil fuel pollution

226
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,680
can make you sick, but how many people

227
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,800
are really suffering from this?

228
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,279
Now, answering that is tricky. You know,

229
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,000
no one's death certificate lists air

230
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,120
pollution as the reason that they died.

231
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But public health experts can study what

232
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,880
happens when our exposure rises and

233
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,200
falls. Public health experts can also

234
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,040
compare people who are a lot alike, but

235
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,519
who breathe in different amounts of

236
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,320
pollution. The best numbers that I've

237
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,120
seen from the recent state of global air

238
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,519
report by the health effects institute

239
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,200
estimated that over 8 million people

240
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:57,200
died from air pollution in 2021.

241
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,320
An estimated 2.3 million people died of

242
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,760
air pollution exposure in China, 2

243
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,480
million in India. In the United States,

244
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,480
an estimated 63,600

245
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,040
people died. That makes air pollution

246
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,760
the second leading risk factor for death

247
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,880
after high blood pressure. To put that

248
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,800
in perspective, the total death toll of

249
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:24,160
the COVID pandemic was about 7 million.

250
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:27,120
Air pollution takes more lives than that

251
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,519
every year. And most of that air

252
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,519
pollution comes from burning fossil

253
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,040
fuels.

254
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,320
Look, every technology has risks. And

255
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,839
maybe having cheap, easy access to

256
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,200
energy is worth some exposure to air

257
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:48,320
pollution. But as someone whose job it

258
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,120
is to help build perspective on climate

259
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,200
change and climate solutions, I do find

260
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,959
myself thinking about this a lot. In

261
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,480
fact, I think about it every time I meet

262
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,160
someone who tells me that they're

263
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,040
worried about the lithium and batteries

264
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,800
or the silver and solar panels.

265
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,680
I think that there's a tendency to

266
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,480
assume that whatever we're doing now

267
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,519
must be okay and that therefore the

268
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,760
risks of doing something new must be

269
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:18,480
very worrisome.

270
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:21,600
But what if the greatest costs are the

271
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,760
ones that were already bearing?

272
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,000
We have so much to gain from a public

273
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,399
health standpoint from switching from

274
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,279
our dependence on fossil fuels to

275
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,680
renewable energy. And importantly, those

276
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,800
health benefits are immediate. I'm not

277
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,200
talking about the changing climate here.

278
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,560
I'm talking about the immediate benefits

279
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,480
of cleaner air for our kids, for

280
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,040
ourselves.

281
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,120
And that doesn't erase my concerns about

282
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,680
the materials that go into solar panels

283
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,720
and batteries. It just reminds me that

284
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,800
we're not adding these technologies to a

285
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:02,240
world that until now was pollutionfree.

286
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,320
I mean, today the world mines about 9

287
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:10,079
billion tons of coal a year, or more

288
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,320
than one ton for every person on Earth.

289
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,920
Oil, too, is pumped out of the ground in

290
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,399
incredible amounts, more than 35 billion

291
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,120
barrels a year. That's enough to

292
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,600
overflow two bathtubs for every person

293
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,000
on the planet. And that energy system,

294
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,600
as we learn today, comes with loads of

295
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
pollution.

296
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:35,399
And I have a lot of hope that our future

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,399
energy mix will come with a lot less.

298
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,839
That's our episode for today. But if you

299
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,399
have your own questions about fossil

300
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,200
fuels and clean energy technologies to

301
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,680
replace them, well, we love hearing from
